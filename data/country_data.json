Hi.\n\nLauren Martin:\tHey everyone, thanks for coming. On the couch next to me is somebody who writes, records, and performs music. But also tells stories about himself and all the people that he works with. So please help me welcome Adam Bainbridge, aka Kindness.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tThanks.\n\nLauren Martin:\tThanks for warming up earlier with some records. We've got a lot to get through today. Before we do, I would like to start with a difficult question. What do the words \"Where are you from?\" mean to you?\nAdam Bainbridge:\tCan I just preface one thing by saying that I was a little bit nervous about this, so I went out and got drunk last night. It's not helping today, because I really thought I would be able to come in here and talk easily about things. But, it's going to be harder than I thought.\n\nLauren Martin:\tOkay, thanks man.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tI might have had a good answer to that once upon a time ... I'm from Peterborough in the east of England, and it's a small town. It wasn't a very fun place to grow up. It was very small towny. There wasn't much music, there wasn't much culture, there definitely wasn't a real sense of multiculturalism or of alternative culture. That was important to me because my mother's Indian, my father is English. I was growing up mixed race in a town that didn't really like non-white people and was further confused by mixed race people.There's a quote by Robert Mapplethorpe, the photographer. He says that growing up in Queens, he was talking about Queens in New York, he said, \"Growing up in Queens was great, because it was the perfect place to leave.\" And that's kind of how I feel about Peterborough.\n\nLauren Martin:\tThat's a good quote. You mention that your mother and your father ... Even if you feel out of place in a place, the people that are around you are the most important to you. Your family's got very strong musical and political stories. Could you tell us about the people you grew up with.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tMy dad was a DJ in his 20's. Not a massively famous one, but I've seen pictures of him and it looks like the peak of Italo with the kind of crazy DJ booth with the lights around it. It's kind of cool because his record collection is behind him, or maybe it's the nightclub record collection which was the old thing. At the Paradise Garage, all the records were behind the DJ and anyone could pick them out and DJ. Though Larry Levan would probably kneecap you before he actually let you do that. But it was an option. Seeing my dad in that kind of environment I was like, \"Ah, okay.\" It was real. It took a few years to get to that point. When we were younger, me and my sister would just roll our eyes and be like, \"Yeah, of course you're a DJ. Right. What kind of music were you playing?\"\nEven then not really understanding some of the tracks that he tried to put us onto. He used to play the 19 minute album cut of \"By the Time I get to Phoenix\" by Isaac Hayes, which is just an organ drone with a heartbeat kick drum underneath it, which finally kicks in at 16 minutes. I was like, \"How did you play this in the club?\" He was like, \"Well, you have to remember in the 1970's, people were smoking a lot of weed. They weren't necessarily dancing all the time.\" I was like, \"Oh, that kind of DJ. All right I get it.\"\nThen on my mum's side, my mum was also heavily into music and it came in useful when I was a teenager because she told an anecdote about how she used to spend a lot of her money on records. Her food money, her money to actually buy groceries. I would go to HMV and spend all of my money on vinyl and she'd be like, \"You were out buying records again?\" I would be like, does this seem familiar to you? I got away with buying records then. She was heavily into jazz. She was brought up in South Africa until she was 14 to Indian and Indian-Malay parents. The worst of apartheid was happening and my grandmother was arrested by the police for collaborating with her lodger, who was then thrown from the 10th floor of the police building in Johannesburg and died. My grandmother was in interrogation in the next room and this happened, she remembers that going down. After they killed him they put her, a 50 year old woman, in jail for 5 years followed by 5 years of house arrest.\nAt that point in time, my mother and her siblings were just ... They had no choice. They had to leave. Their father was dead so it's like, the family is kind of being forcibly being broken up and they all came to Europe. My mum and my two aunts to the United Kingdom and my uncle to Sweden. I think that has definitely left a mark on me and my family and how I perceive things like race and social justice even. There are friends who are going to watch this and it's going to raise a wry smile because I guess I have a reputation amongst my friends for being somewhat overly zealous about these things. When it comes from that family background, at one point you start to understand why it matters and why you're not going to passively stand by and watch people display racism or prejudice or whatever may happen. To this day, I won't take that bullshit. Can I say bullshit?\n\nLauren Martin:\tYes.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tAll right, so what did I bring the swear jar for? Oh yeah, and Lauren... I knew that there was going to be some moments in this interview where I might go too far. Either I was going to get really depressing and dark or legally unsound. You just have to hit this bell. Just save me. Because I'm ready. Today's going to be only real talk, but I'm a little scared of where that might go to be honest.\n\nLauren Martin:\tWell if it's only real talk, we won't need the bell.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tBut real talk can still get me sued.\n\nLauren Martin:\tOkay, I'll bear that in mind. Thank you. I appreciate the gesture of the bell.\nBefore you sidetracked me with a bell. The quote about Queens, it was a great place to leave. Before you left this town in England that you didn't really like and you don't really feel attached to, you might have had music ... The classic escapist idea. I can't imagine the streets of Peterborough have a really popping ... What were you listening to at the time that gave you a sense of a space where you could explore and belong? Is there any music that you'd like to play at the back?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tYeah, I could probably find something. I've talked about this with other mixed race and British Asian kids. We found that white music culture, by that I mean mainstream indie and rock and roll, didn't have anything for us. It didn't speak to us in any way. As much as I was going to underground shows in Peterborough, going to see hardcore and punk and noise music. At one point I was like, \"This is some weird white people shit. I don't really understand it. Is there something else?\"\nIt's funny that you mentioned Westwood earlier. It was mainstream hip-hop, and R&B, and eventually garage, and drum and bass and jungle, and those things. To be fair, mainstream British radio, Radio 1, were doing a pretty good job of it in the 90's. Even John Peel, to a certain extent, would play one of those awful noise records followed by a jungle tune and you'd be like, \"All right John, nice. That's diversity, I like it.\"\nPeterborough did have a tiny bit of that trickling through. I remember for about 3 weeks, someone tried to open a record shop that only sold garage records. I would go in and I would go, \"Oh, yeah. There's that big garage tune coming through. Can I buy it here?\" And they'd go, \"No mate, why would you want to buy here it's 12 quid on white label here. It's going to be at HMV for \u00a32 next week.\" I'd be like, \"What? Don't you want me to spend my money?\" That's why record shops didn't stick around for long in Peterborough.\nI don't know. It could have been garage, it could have been hip-hop, it could be house music as well. I remember hearing.... this might be a good one. Let's just play this, this really reminds me of growing up in Peterborough. And buying records in HMV, and Our Price, and Virgin Megastore.\nLove Like This \u2013 Faith Evans\n\nLauren Martin:\tIf you were trying to buy garage records in Peterborough, what was it about that era of R&B that really spoke to you?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tI think there's a direct lineage between the Bad Boy records era of R&B, and sampling, and production, and what I do now. I'm trying to work more on an alternative side of production, but they were doing such a smart and hooky kind of sampling. I love the original Chic record that this is from, but I think the Faith Evans hook is way better. No disrespect to them, but that is the best use of that guitar riff. It was just my eyes opening to what sampling and production could be I guess. At the time, there were other things like Stardust and Daft Punk where I started to understand that these records were made up of samples rather than played instrumentation. When you don't have a great studio, when you don't have instruments, the option to sample stuff becomes a freedom. Especially when you're flying under the radar and you can still get away with sampling stuff and not clearing it.\n\nLauren Martin:\tOnce you started to absorb these idea of how to make music through sampling, when did you start making music? What were the first instances where you felt you could do something like this?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tI went to Berlin around 2003-2004 and a friend of mine called Ramsey saw me struggling to make music in Garageband. He said \"there's this new software called Ableton and you should try it\". It was like, Ableton version 3 where you still had to manually warpmark every piece of music you were working with, where everything was kind of janky and off. But it was amazing. It was so intuitive and so different from music software that I had tried in the past. I started working then, but I was working more making DJ mixes because I didn't really understand how you produce music. I think layering different elements from different tracks in a DJ mix made me start thinking, \u201cWell I guess what I'm doing is sampling if I'm taking this drum part, and then fading it into this four bar loop from the beginning of this record, and blending it with this vocal....\u201d I could just make songs this way.\nEventually, living back in London, that's what I started doing. I was living in a house with Sam and Rory from a short lived British band called Test Icicles. Which, my good friend Dev Hynes was also part of. We used to play PlayStation in the evening and we thought that the sound effects in Quake or whatever we were playing were kind of lame. So I was downloading much more outrageous explosions, and gun shots, and nonsense from LimeWire and just layering them on top of the game as we were playing so that it was a little more bombastic. They were like, \"Wait, that sounds great. Why don't you do this over our shows?\" I was like, \"Wait, what do you mean?\" \"You know play gunfire, and explosions, and air horns. We've always wanted air horns.\" I was like, \"You want air horns? All right.\" The next day we left on the road and I was now the DJ.\nThat was fun, that was interesting, that was my first experience of sleeping on the floor while the rest of the band sleep in the beds. It was still a lot of fun and it was really nice just to be taken along on what was a short lived roller coaster ride for those guys. And that's how I got to know Dev as well. That was quite an intense baptism by fire into their world.\nBack to London, after these tours, that band was blowing up at the time and they had all of these remix offers. People were offering them crazy money to do remixes and they didn't have time to do it or maybe they didn't want to do it. I said, \"Look guys, why don't I do the remixes and we just say that you did the remix? Why not?\" They were like, \"Yeah, all right. Split it 50/50?\" Done. I started doing all the Test Icicles remixes, please don't look any of them up on YouTube. See, maybe the bell is going to be... I'm gonna get me into trouble. I was doing these remixes and that got me into production properly. I started to think, I can do this. Maybe I could put my mind to it and it can be a career. Little did I know that was just going to be my first attempt at making a career in music.\nI'm going to preface the next part of my story by saying if anyone here is doing this for the first time and it's not quite going the way that you wanted it to go, don't be discouraged. I quit music once and I went away and I had to reset my whole life and get my head straight. Then I came back with a different name and stuff is working out in a roller coaster way of its own. Maybe sometimes you have to have a failed first project to get to the second project that is actually who you want to be or the sound you want to have.\nTest Icicles were also collaborating a lot with grime MCs at the time. That ended up being my first release proper, a Test Icicles remix with Ruff Sqwad. I've decided I really don't want to hear it, but I know you have a part of it.\n\nLauren Martin:\tYeah, I do have it.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tLet's not.\n\nLauren Martin:\tWell is there something else you'd rather play from that time, because this is actually a really interesting time. Before you ...\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tThis.\n\nLauren Martin:\tYes, let's play that. We're talking about the new rave era, the birth of grime, the growth of grime as an underground industry. This amazing independent spirit. While new rave was like a field project-\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tYou're going to get me started on new rave.\nLauren Martin:\tSome interesting people came out of it, so lets keep it happy.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tNo, we're not going to keep it happy. I'm going to go in in a second.\n\nLauren Martin:\tHave a bell.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tJust try and use it.\n\nLauren Martin:\tJust play the record.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tThe only thing about this is an instrumental for people to MC over. It's just a loop, but it's one of the greatest grime loops of all time I guess.\n\nWheel \u2013 Dizzee Rascal\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tDizzee, known more as an artist and performer now. But back in the Boy in da Corner days, doing insane production like that and that was really a moment. That was the thing about living in London in 2003,4,5,6 is that what was happening and growing in British music was insanely exciting. And it was more progressive and a lot more futuristic than anything anyone had ever heard before. It had been years since the mid 90's and jungle and drum & bass. It had been years since any electronic music had come out of nowhere, or seemingly come out of nowhere, and brought this whole new sonic template. Which I guess we still hear echoes of today in Night Slugs and Fade to Mind and other people. It's crazy to me, I hear MikeQ edits of grime tracks and I'm just like, \"Well, ballroom grime. I guess it was going to happen one of these days.\"\n\nLauren Martin:\tNight Slugs is a crew that you're really intimate with. Could you explain to those in the room who might not be so familiar with the climate of black music in London at the time when they were starting and what you've learned from the Night Slugs crew? I guess hanging out with them is quite an education sometimes.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tOh yeah, for sure. Myself and Alex Sushon, Bok Bok, have been close for a number of years. He was around at the same time that I was putting out these first productions and he was very supportive. We had a good dialogue about music at that moment in time. What's fucked up is after this impending tumble comes and I didn't feel good about the music I made anymore, I just stopped going to those raves and listening to that music. And I remember one day we were having a text conversation and he's like, \"You coming down to Night Slugs?\" And I was like, \"Man, I'm too old for that. I just don't understand. I don't think it's for me.\" He got angry with me and he was like \u201cyou're such a loser\u201d. Why would you just shut off a whole side of your musical personality, partly because you got burned. He understands that I didn't feel good about the music. It's kind of taken me years to slowly get back to that place.\nNow it's great. I'm actively working on music with Alex. I get to spend time with Girl Unit and with Jam City and just hear the exciting places that they're taking music. Jam City, especially, I think is pushing the envelope so much with sound design, and song writing, and production. Can I just talk about the bad shit in 2005 now? For a second?\n\nLauren Martin:\tSure, go ahead. I was going to ask you, but if you're happy now.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tI want to get it out of my system. I think once I've got this off my chest I'll be ready to go to a happier place. This wasn't going to be easy.\n2005 and 2006 in London, I just associate with being completely toxic. In my mind now I'm just like, that was a bad time. New rave was just a side show to that, but it was kind of a part of it. New rave, if it stands for anything ... I don't know if anyone in this room actually ever listened to that music or followed it, but it was kind of a bastardized indie version of rave music. It would be guys in fluorescent trousers and American Apparel shell suits playing kind of break beat stuff with air horns and sampled phrases from old rave records, and it was horrible. It was the worst music of all time.\nI was living there at this moment trying to be open minded, trying to be positive about music and just thinking, I feel like such a fake. I have to go to these parties and keep a smile on my face when I see this absolute douche bag walking in the door, who is kind of destroying everything good about pop and alternative music. This is also where it comes into identity and things like sexuality, I feel like ... Peaches said this in an interview the other day, \"New rave music was electroclash with everything gay sucked out of it.\" I liked electroclash on a song writing level, the production of it grated on me after a while. But at its heart electroclash was originally a queer scene and it had a diversity and open mindedness, even the producers making that music.\nNew rave was 90% straight bros that had seen this opportunity to get famous fast and do it by adopting all of the signifiers of an underground... And at the time a queer culture. There were parties called things like Boombox and Family which were 90% gay men dressed that way. Then bands like the Klaxons and Hadouken and stuff came in and were like, \"All right, we'll have that.\" And, here we go.\nI just thought it was a bad time, it didn't feel good. What made it worse for me is that I was struggling with my identity and my sexuality at the time. There was a blog called 'Styleslut', and I'm going to name the guy now. There's this guy called Donald Crunk, that's a pseudonym, that's not his real name. I'm not going to say his real name, but he still writes under that pseudonym. Now in 2015, this motherfucker is now making short films with young girls and trying to pass it off as some Nowness thing, but it's just ugly exploitation. Back then, in 2005/2006, he started this blog which was recounting what was going on in London. New rave, grime, hip-hop, alternative bands. But this blog was the most virulent, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, trans-phobic, piece of shit I've ever seen in my life. It's still on line if you want to go back and look at it.\nOne day this guy decided he was going to pick on me. He started talking about me in homophobic and trans-phobic terms, and I was just like, \"Wait, what? Where did this come from?\" What was even more fucked up is rather than being angry at him I was like, \"Wait, how did he know? Do people know this? Shit, what am I going to do? I can't be a grime producer if people know I'm gay. If people know I'm queer. If they know, fuck.\" What took it another step deeper was that at the time, again with questions about identity, I was researching hormones. I was thinking about going there and this guy is not just abusing me in homophobic terms, he's abusing me in trans-phobic terms and I'm like, \"What the fuck? I gotta get out.\"\nAnd over night, I just shut down. I stopped my music. I left London. I was scared. I was like, I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to be in a place where people can be in a position of power and have these platforms, widely read platforms, with a shit load of positive comments on every article from other people that seem to appreciate this base, racist, misogynist abuse.\nHonestly, to this day, I can't believe that this guy got away with this shit. That's why I want to talk about it now. This guy got picked, by the BBC, to be one of the panelist on what they call their annual 'Sound Of'. Which is music people from the industry talking about who they think is going to be the next big artist for the year upcoming. It's bullshit. It's always very commercialized and it's kind of rigged. But for me, it was more like... the industry and the media should take one look at this guy's blog and see how toxic it is. Yet, they embraced him and his writing and his thought process. And they give him a platform where he can now be influencing what happens in music, where he can choose the next artist coming up.\nAnd I'm just like, \"That's not okay. We shouldn't give people that power to fuck up people.\" If you are a racist, if you are homophobic, you shouldn't be allowed to work in the music industry. Full stop. Because the music industry, and this goes back to blues and Motown, is based on the talents of nonwhite people. People of queer identity. That's where so much of good music comes from. House music comes from disco music, which comes from black gay men. How can you allow people that don't like those things, and want to go on record saying how much they don't like those things, have any influence within that arena. For me that's not possible. That's part of what we really need to solve now.\nI look around this room and I see nonwhite faces, I see women, and I'm happy to see you here, but I'm going to tell you it's going to be tough. It's still not a smooth ride, especially when even in the younger generation that's working in music, and management, and record labels now, they're still predominately straight white guys. They have a language and a vocabulary amongst themselves. They don't even know how to talk to you, or talk about you, or understand your issues. I've spoken about this, especially with black women. Black women in the industry they're like, \"My manager is a white guy. And I have to sit him down and say these are things I need to see you actively defending and pushing back against. And if you don't do that, we can't work together.\" And the guy will go, \"Oh funny, I didn't realize that might be an issue.\" She's like, exactly. All right, rant over.\n\nLauren Martin:\tThanks for that, I appreciate you talking ...\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tI can see your worried eyes to your colleague...\n\nLauren Martin:\tNo, not at all. Thanks for being so honest I and everyone else really appreciate it. I didn't ring the bell once.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tYou could've.\n\nLauren Martin:\tThat's how real it was.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tShould I play something happy?\n\nLauren Martin:\tWhy don't we play some music, yes.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tLet me see, what happens next in the sequence?\n\nLauren Martin:\tWhat happens next, for you. You left London, you cut it all off, it was a bad time. What did you do to make amends with yourself and what happened?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tIt has to get worst before it gets better. My father died the same year, so I was just like all right I'm out. I'm out of music, I'm kind of out life. I went to work back at the Hotpoint factory back in Peterborough. The washing machine people.\n\nLauren Martin:\tWashing machine factory, okay.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tI was telling my mum about it the other day I was like, \"You remember when I used to work at Hotpoint to make money?\" She was like, \"Yeah, I kind of remember that. You must have been so bored.\" I was like, \"Mum, I was asleep.\" After a few days I realized that the women working in our portacabin didn't give a shit, so I would come in and earlier every day I would just put my head down on the desk and sleep until someone woke me up and was like, \"Come on mate. That's not cool. You got to do some work.\" I kind of reset that way. That was quite a good way to just start a fresh. And I saved some money and I moved back to Berlin.\nI can condense this a little bit. In Berlin, at that moment in time, the climate was good, I fell in love again, I was happy, I had a new relationship, and I was like, \"All right. Maybe I'm just going to music for me, for fun. I'm not going to play it to anyone. It's just for me.\" And I started messing around and one of the first things that came out of it was my version of \"Swingin' Party\" by the Replacements. I was like, \"Hm, all right. You might be on to something.\" I had never sung before in my life. To this day, I'm going to put my hand up, more real talk. I know I'm a pretty mediocre singer. I'm not a great singer. I'm a producer, I'm a music fan, I'm not a singer. It kind of sucks to have to play shows in front of 10,000 people. There's other artists doing the same though ... You know Taylor Swift can't sing.\n\nLauren Martin:\tSo shady.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tShe deserves it. I had been making these productions thinking, maybe I can find another vocalist to sing on them. I didn't think I would ever end up singing on them. Which to this day, might not have been the smartest idea, but it started coming. I was like, \"Well the melody will kind of be this, I guess I'll finish it.\" I ended up with 3 or 4 tracks. I sent them to two places, this is quite funny. I sent them to Red Bull Music Academy, didn't get in. But what it did do was it gave me this deadline where I was thinking, \"What am I making this music for?\" There was this submission deadline where they wanted X amount of music and this kind of brief about who you are and your personality. Writing that helped me figure out what my music was, and finishing the tracks for it helped me figure out what my music was. To this day it doesn't makes me mad that I didn't get in. It got me going.\nThe other place I went was ... I got an email from a label that I had actually been dealing with in my grime days and they said, \"We've heard this track on MySpace, we'd like to put it out.\" That lead to a seven inch single coming out on Moshi Moshi records. Off the back of that, things just started happening. We can go there in a minute, should I maybe play \"Swingin' Party\"? I think I have it somewhere.\n\nLauren Martin:\tYeah, sure.\n\nSwingin' Party \u2013 Kindness\n\nLauren Martin:\tAre we doing the b side or are you just having a flip?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tNo, I'm getting it ready for the other song. But, I just realized that ... We're only up to 2009 and we've already been here for 40 minutes.\n\nLauren Martin:\tWhat did we just listen to? Talk us through that a little bit?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tThat was the album version of \"Swing Party.\" The seven inch version is way more crazy sounding. I really couldn't sing then. I prefer this version.\nAnother thing that I thought about talking to you guys today was that I wanted to break down some stuff that might happen to you as you come into the music industry. If you get signed, if you're going to put out a record. Stuff that doesn't normally get talked about. I think as much as it might be slightly boring, it could also be really valuable, because if anyone had sit me down when this stuff was happening to me and gone, \"That's a red flag.\" I might not be in the position I am in today, which we'll also get onto later.\nOff the back of putting out this record in an independent label, some majors came calling. Apparently what had happened was that 2009 was a terrible year for music. There was just no music worth signing. All of the A&R guys have a signing budget and they have to assign a certain amount to money to artists within a year. They have to, they get into trouble if they don't. October 2009 comes around, and I start getting all these phone calls and I'm like, \"Wait, what the fuck is going on?\" I think it was just that they hadn't signed anyone that year so they were like, \"All right, this guy is getting some heat on the internet, let's sign him.\" Things got really out of hand. People started bargaining off of each other and the money starts getting higher, and higher, and higher.\nHere's where it's interesting, it doesn't matter to me anymore. It's going to sound completely outrageous because no one gets signed for these sums. At least not an alternative artist anymore. I got signed for \u00a3100,000 by Polydor. And a \u00a3150,000 by Universal Publishing for my publishing. Which is a shit load of money. But I didn't know the reality of that, which is that 50% goes to tax, because you've reached a certain threshold in the year. 20% goes to your manager. So, of \u00a3250,000 you're left with 30%, which then has to last you the 3 or 4 years until your record comes out. You're not getting any more money. Something that seems like a ray of light coming down from the heavens is actually way more practical than that. That's just ... Kind of like a regular salary to keep you going. I can't imagine what it is now when people are getting ripped off for label deals and for publishing. I know people getting signed for \u00a35,000 now.\nHere's another bit of real talk. If some independent label, naming no names, is coming at you for \u00a35,000 to sign your publishing and you've never put out any music but you believe in your music and you know it's going to go somewhere, don't do it. There's a guy at one of the labels who used to look up 'New Band of the Day' at the Guardian. As soon as it came out he'd get on the phone and call up that band and be like, \"I'll sign your publishing. \u00a35,000.\" Do you know why they were doing it? Because they got tax breaks on it. They didn't do it because they believed in anyone's music. The label, that owned that publishing company ... Maybe you'll want to hit the bell soon. By doing that, they didn't have to pay the \u00a3x million of tax that they had outstanding. Now that's kind of fucked up.\n\nLauren Martin:\tWhere do you fit into all of this? Your first album was released independently-\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tNo, it was released on a major.\n\nLauren Martin:\tWas released on a major, sorry. The first release, not the first album. And then you went to-\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tNo the first album was also released on a major. Someone didn't do their fact checking.\n\nLauren Martin:\tDon't be shady.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tI deserve it.\n\nLauren Martin:\tI know more about you than you do sweetheart.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tI'm not... come on.\n\nLauren Martin:\tWhatever the hell you put out, who cares at this point. You went between indies and majors in quite a short frame of time. What were you doing at the time within that world where you went, \"No, I can't do this. I have to go back doing this myself and I have to figure it out all myself.\"\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tI got dropped. That's what happened.\n\nLauren Martin:\tObviously you do know more about you than I do.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tI should probably just play some music and talk about making music. At the same time ... But seriously, there's going to be people in this room who are going to get approached to do similar things to what happened to me. No one is ever going to sit you down or write this down for you. Part of it is admitting that you were foolish and didn't know what was going on. I just assumed that I could trust my management, which was also a foolish thing to do, and that I could trust the best intentions of an industry to be putting out music for the right reasons. That's not necessarily the case. In some places, yes.\nAlbum one didn't really go the way that the label wanted it to. They sacked both of my A&R men that signed me. That's another thing, if you were to sign a contract with a major, there's a thing called a key man clause, which is kind of empowering for you, which says that the person that signed you and believes in you, if they leave the company you have the option to leave as well. I think that's really important. I can think of other artists this has happened to where you get signed by a big label, maybe you get signed by an independent, and the guy that was really your champion and can take the finished record to the head of the label and go, \"This is what we're doing with this.\" If they're out the door for whatever the reason, you no longer have a champion. And you're literally just the CDR in the corner of the office. And you don't want to be that person.\nYou need someone that who's there every day saying, \"All right, things didn't go the way we wanted with this first video, first single. Lets keep going.\" I got dropped by Polydor and Universal, but in a way that was a blessing. A genuine blessing. One of the things my ex-manager did, bless him, was he went into Polydor and he said, \"Look. We don't really think you're engaged with us on this record, you let go the people that were going to work on it with Adam. This is going to sound crazy, but we want the rights back. Give us the master rights back to the record.\" Because when you sign a contract with a label, they get to own the copyrights and master rights kind of in perpetuity. For whatever reason, the guy said, \"All right. The masters are yours. We'll give it back to you.\" Now I own my first record.\n\nLauren Martin:\tTo be honest, for all the major label things, that deserves applause.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tThat never happens. It's like winning the lottery. To this day, owning the master for my first record and now owning the master for my second record and licensing it, means I can survive. I don't make a lot of money, but stuff like streaming. If you own the master rights, because that's really where the money comes from streaming, you take home 90% of streaming income. If you're signed to a label like Universal, maybe if even if you signed to an independent, you're taking 5% of that 90% home. You're not getting paid. No wonder you get these checks at the end of the month, like Spotify, 3p. Because it's 5% of 90%. When you can, if you can self finance your record and self release it, do it. Look around. People are getting huge off of self made, self promoted music.\nIf you have a vision, unless you think that a label is going to help you catapult yourself to the next level, it's not necessary. It really isn't. You can be your own team. You're the best PR, the best A&R, the best stylist, the best musical director you have. Because you have all of those talents within you. It might seem scary, or maybe you don't want that responsibility, then honestly you could find that team. And if you can find it, more power to you because a good team is the best thing to have of all. But it's so hard and you can't necessarily trust the people that you're even close to in terms of a work life. Maybe we'll come to that later.\n\nLauren Martin:\tOkay right. Now I'm going to do some real talk. Lets talk about some of your music.\nCould we please run the first video?\n\nStill Smokin' \u2013 Trouble Funk\n\nNow that wasn't you. Evidently.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tShould I ... Maybe this ... We haven't had a lot of music. Should I play this?\n\nLauren Martin:\tHang on, I'm talking to you now. Who was that and what was that song?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tThat was Trouble Funk and the song was called \"Still Smoking\" and that performance was from, funny enough, from Sunderland in 1986 I think. There was a British music TV show called \"The Tube.\" Trouble Funk got signed to Island Records and they were one of the few go-go bands to actually start releasing music outside of D.C., and internationally, and gained a worldwide recognition.\nDoes anyone know what go-go music is?\n\nLauren Martin:\tI was just about to say it would be really great if you could explain it, because it's such a regional sound.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tThis kind of comes back to LimeWire era of file sharing where stuff started trickling through that you might not of have had access to, in the United Kingdom especially. And I remember hearing \"One Thing\" by Amerie, produced by Rich Harrison, and thinking, \"What are these drum breaks? These are crazy.\" And researching more and finding out that Rich Harrison was from the D.C. area and that he was influenced by go-go.\nGo-go is live music that's performed in clubs in the D.C. Area... It was started by a guy called Chuck Brown. The band plays continuously for about two hours and it's all based on this one groove. The drum beat doesn't really change, some of the percussion elements on top like the congas and the cowbells change, but the drum break is fundamentally the same on every song. There's a load of bands, and Trouble Funk are just one of a number of amazing D.C. bands that are still going actually.\nWhat happened to go-go was it couldn't get out of it's regional scene and it doesn't really work on record. To this day, I have a lot of go-go records, they don't deliver 1% of what it is to see a band play live and communicate with the audience, because a lot of it's based on audience participation as well.\n\nLauren Martin:\tOnce you found this track through LimeWire and finding this Amerie record, you went on to make a track that samples that track. But it's not just a case of sampling, and how a lot of people in this room might make a record through sampling, you actually went out there and met them and worked with them on this track. Could you talk about that experience and within that, where do you differentiate between finding a track and sampling and asking for permission, and then actually seeking out the people and working with them on the record? Because that's what you did.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tI'm all for it. I was telling someone the other day that everyone I sampled on the first record, I ended up meeting and working with. That's a hot tip. Sample some of your heroes and maybe it will happen. With Trouble Funk, I actually met them later when I wanted to make the music video. The studio version of this we did from a high quality wave file of the song and then me and Philippe did all the production here in Paris. The first record I worked on with Philippe Zdar from Cassius. When the song was done and it was time to make a video for it, I thought, \"Well, this would be kind of nuts. What if I could get the band that wrote the song and made the audio that I sampled from, what if I asked them to replay the song with the new hook and the new lyrics and the new arrangement.\" They were up for it. I went out to D.C. and did that with them. Amazing people, great guys, just funny how stuff happens like that.\n\nLauren Martin:\tShould we listen to your version of it? I think that would be quite interesting to see the difference because we saw the original. I have it, but do you have it as well?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tYeah, I have it. This is a version here.\n\nLauren Martin:\tYou're so ahead of me, thank you.\n\nThat's Alright - Kindness\n\nThanks very much for that. So that experience of working with Trouble Funk, and performing with them, and you present to them a new version of something that they'd work on many years before, that's not the only kind of way you collaborate with people. Your very hands on. Who else have you collaborated with and how has those various processes shape what you do individually?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tOn this new record, that was kind of my collaboration record. That was where I decided to get it all out of my system and just work with everyone. Predominantly with Kelela, with Dev, with Robyn ... And on an equally creative, and in terms of contribution, just great session people. People that I've met now through the music community who play on the top of their game. I think a really soulful professional player can just do something incredible. This may be a taboo.... around using people do gigs, but they did it on Motown, they did it on Phil Spector, they did it on ... Chic were studio musicians, it doesn't mean that \"I'm Coming Out\" wasn't a great record. Collaboration has definitely become a good way to ... Hopefully bring the best of what I do, which I guess I think is more on the production side, and the best of what other people do which is normally like songwriting and incredible vocals. This is a good example of hearing someone's music for the first time and saying, \"I have to work with this person.\"\n\nLauren Martin:\tOkay, lets play that then.\n\nBank Head - Kelela\n\nA gorgeous record, yeah.\nWho is Kelela for somebody that might be unfamiliar? We've heard her voice, but who's the woman behind the voice?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tKelela is probably my favorite living vocalist. She's a black woman of Ethiopian heritage originally from Washington D.C. I just remember hearing that track, probably on Soundcloud, and thinking, \"Holy shit. I will move heaven and earth, how do I work with that voice.\" I guess what was nice, either serendipity or just ... It still took a bit of work, but she was collaborating on her first release with a lot of the Night Slugs and Fade to Mind guys at the time. I remember putting an email into to someone saying, \"You're working with Kelela right?\" And they were like, \"Yeah, you should come meet her in LA.\" Literally the first day we met, we cut some vocals that ended up being on my album. Which I don't normally do. I like to get to know people first, and maybe hang out with them, and get drunk. Once we've been drunk together and hung over together you've probably a bond for life.\n\nLauren Martin:\tIt's like a level playing field.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tWe know each other now. We've seen the best and the worst. She came into the studio and I played all the demos I had at the time for \"Otherness\" in one long strip. We turned the lights down, and she sat in the back of the room with a handheld mic like this, no fancy vocal mic, and just improvised. Once or twice she said, \"Oh, can I have that again. I have some more melodic ideas.\" Her vocal parts and adlibs on \"Geneva\" for example, that is the sound of her hearing the song for the first time. There was no second take, there's no edit. It's just purely the melody that came from her mouth is in the track from start to finish. Not just the voice, but that kind of melodic gift, I remember sitting there going, \"Oh, what? Oh dear.\" It's a bit like Ghostbusters, what if we cross the streams? The universe is going to end.\n\nLauren Martin:\tWith Kelela then, to be kind of ... You obviously want to collaborate the best people possible. The people that you think are the most talented or could have an affinity with you, rather than something in common. You say you're really in awe of her voice but you don't really like your own. How do you feel singing on your own music when you're working with other singers? There must be an anxiety you have to work through with that.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tYeah, I don't know what the answer is. I don't really have any choice. The thing about music now ... You get so uncomfortable every time I go to real talk.\n\nLauren Martin:\tI like the real talk, it's cool.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tPart of it is that ... I guess what people want from you is also partly your personality. They don't just want melody, or production, or songwriting. I can't justify releasing music that I don't sing on at all. People might be able hear a little bit of my personality in my production, but if there's a song that's kind of in my vocal range, I might as well have a go. And knowing that I can get some support from better vocalist to layer things and make it sound good. It would be dishonest of me to not try, knowing that I can even if it's not my favorite thing in the world.\nThat's also part of being honest. If you're making music you might as well make yourself vulnerable. You might as well be open to the things that scare you. It's what the Joubert Singers were talking about the other night. Even for great singers. Who was in that studio session with them? What was interesting was that when they broke it down to just the four of them alone in the room and they were trying to do the takes to the song, I don't know if you picked it up but they were as shy as we were. At one point they were like, \"I don't want to sing that part. Don't make me adlib.\" She was starting to hold back on the mic, and even the best singer in the world probably has hangups about their voice.\nThat's also part of collaboration, I think for me I was really glad that we did that session together. Because it does show that people who that are mainly producers all of the issues that come into producing a vocal. It is emotional and it can be kind of scary and intense. But you have to be real and you have to be kind to the person and just hope that you get through it together. And when it does work, it's incredible.\n\nLauren Martin:\tYou don't just work with other vocalists though, you work with producers, engineers, live musicians. Is there anybody in particular that really stands out for you? I know we have a video that you'd quite like to play of somebody that you work with.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tWhat's special about this video... is when Dev finished his last album \"Cupid Deluxe\", we had been hanging out in London the week before and were looking at pictures of Eddy Grant in Georgetown in Guyana. And he was like, \"Damn, that would be amazing. What if we just went to Georgetown and shot a video for the new record?\" And I was like, \"That sounds crazy?\" He was like, \"I don't know, you film it.\" I've only directed video for myself really. He's like, \"I don't care. Come.\" I was like, \"Are you serious?\" And he has to leave to go back to the airport and all the way in the cab we were texting \"No really, are you serious? This is going to cost money. We can't just fly halfway across the world to make a video. And you know I only shoot on film as well because I'm an idiot.\" And he's like, \"You can do that if you want to.\" Let's show the video.\n\nChamakay \u2013 Blood Orange\n\nLauren Martin:\tYou worked on that track and directed the video, and what I find particularly interesting and inspiring in regard to that is how you present yourself and the people that you work with as in a direct and honest as a way possible, by directing your own videos and being the face of them, that's a form of empowerment within your music. Could you talk a little bit about thoughts that you have when you direct these videos and come together like that?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tWorking on that one ... It was just a gift. I really thought he was joking, and then all of the sudden we were on a plane. It was intense and it was a lot of work, but imagine going to the country your friend's mother is from with your friend and meeting his family for the first time. The whole thing, start to finish, was like, \"This is a trip. I can't believe we're doing this.\" And it's nice to document it as well. In a way, I think what was more important for him was going. The fact that we got a video out of it was a bonus.\nI think in terms of music video as well, and self directing because he just self directed his new one that came out a couple of days ago which was amazing. I think this is the thing, maybe there's people in the room that are starting to make music videos for their tracks. Maybe you're still making videos on your own, and that's amazing. Don't think that there might necessarily be a better alternative. There are really great directors out there, who do frequently make incredible pieces of work for people's tracks. But on the flip side, if you make your own video, you know how much you're spending. You get to choose what you spend it on. There's just no reason not to. A lot of who you are comes across in those mediums.\nAnd also, it's a financial thing. A video that a production company might ask \u00a310,000-20,000 for, you can honestly do for \u00a31,000 if you cut out all of the middle men. It's not in the interest of your label to tell you that, because ... I think this is the normal way it works, but a video is paid half by the artist and half by the label. So the label puts up the money for it, but whatever it costs you are now in debt for half the cost of the video. Which is fine if you manage to keep the budgets small, it just adds a little bump to the total amount that you have to recoup from your label. If, and again I'm not going to say who it is, you're a label that makes their major label artists spend half a million dollars on a video that never gets released and you as the artist and your management were like, \"We think this is a good idea.\" Now you're another quarter of a million dollars in debt to the label. You might manage to clear that, but you've just got to be careful.\nVideo can be really expensive. Equally, maybe the most appropriate thing for your track could be you shooting with your selfie cam on your iPhone. Don't let anyone stop you do that.\n\nLauren Martin:\tSpeaking of expensive, you have a live band that you go on tour with. I'm curious to know, as I'm sure a lot of other people are, how you go from working in a studio on your music to transferring that to a live show. It's something that a lot of people do, a lot of people have gotten very ambitious with. It's a much bigger undertaking than you just packing up a van. How did you put together a band that you're happy with and what were the trials and tribulations of doing that to a point where you were happy?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tThis is a pandora's box too. Let's be honest, it's not actually that easy doing this. The reason why I have so many ambivalent stories about things is because it isn't always the smooth part. I guess I haven't expected it to be either.\nPutting a band together. There are ways of putting a record on stage, especially if it is heavily electronic. The simplest way is probably to have you as the vocalist and backing tracks. Honestly, from that point on, you're just adding things. You might add a keyboard player, you might add more vocalists, a drummer, all of these things. Fundamentally, most live acts now start with the original studio version of the track and build on it. That's what we did as well. I have guy called Blue May who was my musical director for the first record and this one. Then he also ended up mixing my second record, so shout out to Blue. He helped me find musicians for the live band at first. On this time around I ended up working with Chris Egan and Bryndon Cook who play with Solange Knowles as well. Chris Egan also drums for Blood Orange.\nLive band ... Okay. A live band costs money, and again, there's a lot of people in the room [indicates RBMA room] who if you're solo artist, if you're starting out as a producer, you're not in a band. You're not splitting the proceeds from gigs four ways with other musicians, you are the person who gets paid for the show. If you're going to have a band you have to pay them wages, or you should be paying them wages. Over time, it's expensive. What can I say. I don't make money from playing live. I do it to support the music that I make, and I want people to see a live show, and I want ... Again, it's a really good way to communicate your music to people. I think there are bands that are making money, but they're headlining festivals and they're two notches higher up the bill than I am. Where I am right now, I'm breaking even. And I'm breaking even until ...\nHere's another thing just because I want people to understand how easy it is to go from being totally stable and having a vision for where you're going and then one day you get a call from your new accountant and he says, \"Adam, you're technically insolvent. You're bankrupt.\" That happened to me two months ago. What happened was that after a year of touring, I had got to the same place. Not really making any profit from my live show but I knew I had broken even. And when you do live shows, you account in the budget for all the fees that are going to come into play in finalizing all of these things. There should be a line in the budget that says accountancy fees X for all of these shows. In my budgets, I guess we sort of underestimated because after all of the profits had come in and we're back at zero, my accountants turn around and they're like, \"You owe us \u00a360,000.\" I'm like, \"Well, I have no money. I don't know how I'm going to pay \u00a360,000.\"\nI try and get out of it and I try and talk to my lawyer. My lawyer doesn't want to help. So I say I'm going to change lawyers as well, because I reckon I'm off. He's like, \"That's cool. You owe me \u00a340,000.\" And I'm like, \"Wait, a week ago I owed no one nothing, now I owe \u00a3100,000 to two companies. What is going on?\" I managed to negotiate deals with both of those people and now, bless them, thank you very much. We're done. Don't worry about it. I'm digging myself out of a hole. I'm not technically bankrupt now, I'm just in debt. But I have future earnings that will offset.\nThat's the thing, you need to know that ... I know a few of you think that I'm doing well, but I thought I was doing well. And now... nope! I'm not doing well at all. But it's going to be fine, and I truly believe that. This also comes back to what I was saying about a team. Get your team straight. Know that you can trust your lawyer, know that you can trust your accountants. Know that they're not going to present with the same bill they're presenting Mariah Carey. You probably shouldn't work with the accountants that are working with Mariah Carey. My mistake. Over all of this, watching like a hawk, should be your management saying, \"Maybe they are too expensive for us\" or \"Maybe we shouldn't do this.\" I take partial responsibility for what happened. But I also feel like my ex-manager probably should have ... Well alright, you chose a good moment to hit the bell. Anyway, just be careful is all I'm saying.\n\nLauren Martin:\tThat was more of a hover. It's not been doom and gloom, don't worry. It's been informative. I think a lot of people in this room will definitely appreciate your honesty.\nPutting it a little bit back to your music. Is there something that you would like to play that really demonstrates where you're at right now? Be it something of yours or something that you've bought and you love. You've gone through a lot of musical journeys up until this point and it would be great to get a sense of where you are right now coming out the other side of whatever all that is.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tWhat would that be?\n\nLauren Martin:\tOne record to solve all of that.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tThis is something uplifting. Do you want to put this on? Okay, all right.\n\nMusic Sounds Better With You - Stardust\n\nLauren Martin:\tCould everybody give a big hand to Kindness for talking today?\n\nWould anybody like to ask some questions, for Adam?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tCan I also just explain that I put my cheerful sweater on. That's actually what this was sitting waiting for was just the moment when I need to like, all right. All right. Get started.\n\nGareth:\tThat was really refreshing, thank you for your honesty. I have a boring question after all of that, you kind of touched on it already. Kindness sticks out to me because, maybe 2012 after resisting it for a long time I downloaded Spotify and did the radio thing and a track called \"SEOD\" came up and I loved it. It was kind of my first discovery of the streaming generation. So I'm glad to hear you say that it's coming to the point where you're making some money from it. I'm just curious to hear some more about that, because I'm still in two minds about streaming. From both sides, as a musician and a consumer. And maybe some more thoughts on what you have.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tWhat's your name?\n\nGareth:\tGareth.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tHi Gareth. It comes back to what I said before. If you actually own your music, or the masters, if you're licensing with someone, maybe if you even negotiated a good deal with the label that you're working with. Which is possible. You can be signed to a label and talk specifically about streaming income, and ratios, and how much of the royalty they're going to pay you. You could be in a good place.\nThat's what's kind of dumb about royalty ratios for streaming. A royalty ratio for a physical CD is around 6%, roughly for every one sold. The traditional reason for that was the overheads, and producing it, and marketing spent, and things around releasing a record. A digital stream has no overhead. Once it's uploaded to the server somewhere, it doesn't cost the label anymore money. Why are they only paying you 6%? It doesn't make sense. Now there are more progressive labels that if you're signed to a contract with them and they own the music, they might actually pay you 50% of the royalty on the streaming alone. That's pretty good, that's better than 6.\nBut if you're going to get played a couple of million times, which in 2015 sometimes can you do, what if you owned the master? That's maybe a few thousand pounds a month. That can make all of the difference.\n\nGareth:\tI feel like that's becoming a more common thing to be heard form a musician, particularly of the independent side of things and not Thom Yorke. That's really refreshing to hear from those people who are saying, \"This works. If you can do it, it works.\"\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tIt's more that there isn't a better alternative. There are things at Bandcamp and there's ways of selling music directly to people that want to hear it. But at this point, unless something completely unexpected comes along, I see everything going towards the streaming model. It makes sense. I don't particularly like it, I think it devalues music overall. It's the same way that Netflix has become the go-to for moving video on TV. Why won't streaming become a thing for music? I meet music fans and people in the industry now that said, \"That's great, I actually bought your record on iTunes. It's the only record I bought this year.\" And I'm like, \"Well, I'm honored. But you only bought one record this year?\" \"Yeah, I stream everything else.\" \"With the adverts?\" I mean, anyway-\n\nGareth:\tIt seems like more people are using it for discovery and then going out and buying the records. In theory ...\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tPotentially.\n\nGareth:\tOn a side note, it was the vocals that really attracted me to that record and the imperfection. It was cool.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tI appreciate that. Thanks for your time.\n\nSpeaker 4:\tWhat's the most I can do as a straight white male to combat the deeply rooted flaws in the music industry?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tReally good question and I'm actually happy that a straight white man would ask that question. I had a discussion with one last night that wasn't ready. Not naming names.\nYou can't be passive. If you're ever on a label, and one of your label mates is getting fucked over, you need to say something. If you're playing a music festival, and you realize that an artist of colour or queer artist is being marginalized and you're being given an opportunity that they're not, maybe you say something. Say something to the promoters, say something to the booker. I tried to do this at Pitchfork Festival last year and I made myself another enemy. Some of us are just going to have be that guy that sabotages their career, but does it for everyone else.\nI'm just tired of it, I'm really tired. I'm tired that talented artists of color, talented artists of non-heterosexual identity are having such a hard time just breaking through a glass ceiling. Because there is one. And you can just be an ally, be friends with those people. Be honest with yourself if you're influenced by their music.\nI think that's what outraged me the most was this guy was like, \"There is no 'black music' anymore. White music can be a version of black music.\" I was, \"What are you talking about?\" That was what upset me about the Charleston shootings as well. You had a lot of black artists coming out online saying, \"This is fucked up. Something has got to change.\" And then all of the white artists who make their living off hip-hop, or R&B, or club music that comes from a direct lineage from black culture are like ...\n\nLauren Martin:\tThe silence is pretty loud sometimes.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tYeah, and you're just like, \"Now you don't have anything to say?\" You're happy to slip into some code switched Ebonics when it suits you on Twitter, but the minute 9 people get shot in a church it's not your problem anymore. Well, fuck you. Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 5:\tI don't really have a question, I just want to thank you. You really touched me and I think you touched more people. The time you have on that couch, instead of talking about your own material you really thought about what you think is important to tell us and I think that's ... It really got me emotional, because I think it's so important that someone at some point in your career reaches out and tell you that shit. Because I almost fucked up my own career and I didn't do it, because someone stepped and was like, \"Yo, do you know what you're signing?\" I really want to thank you for that. Thank you so much.\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tThank you.\n\nLauren Martin:\tIs there anybody else that's curious at all?\n\nSpeaker 6:\tFirst, thank you so much for being here and being honest. I don't even know how to ask questions, I just really appreciate you talking about racism, and sexism, and stuff. I'm from Japan, I'm Asian, and I'm a woman and I had some difficulty working as a musician and also about music industry thing... I also had many difficulties. I've been living in Japan and tried releasing some of my records in the United States, and tried hard to learn English, and learn how the indie music industry works, how media works, how publishing works, but it's always really hard. And I already made some mistakes and I lost my money. I still want to make music and I have to deal with it.\nMy question is, I want to do everything about a lot of my music, as much as possible by myself. But, there is a limit what you can do and at least in Asia you can't find trust. I'm finding it difficult to trust people. How you could find your manager that you can trust or how you can trust people?\n\nAdam Bainbridge:\tThat's a really good question. I just want to say I don't think there's anyone in this room that hasn't made mistakes. What's amazing is you're still here now, you didn't give up. If you gave up, you wouldn't be sitting here. I think everyone needs a round of applause, because I don't know what you've been through but ...\nWe're all going to get there. I feel like we're part of a new generation. There's a new generation that's going to look out for each other. I see it coming up on the internet, and I see it on Tumblr, and places like that where I'm like, \"Damn, this bullshit with racism, sexism, and homophobia that I experienced in 2005, it wouldn't be allowed now.\" People would just shut it down and that's what we need to start doing.\nIn terms of finding people that you can work with, managers and labels, I think you just have to ask around and people have to be honest with each other. I feel like, people are sometimes shy talking about the mistakes they've made because they don't want to seem foolish. Privately, I maybe did it too much publicly today.... I would talk about people that I think are bad news in the industry. There are other people that are as toxic as that blogger I was talking about, but they're heads of labels and they're lawyers. And they feel the same way about women and gay artists, but they're in positions of power.\nAnd if you said to me, \"I'm thinking of signing with X label\" and I knew that guy was like that, I would be like, \"No, and these are the reasons why.\" We just need to keep our ears open and talk to each other. Now that I'm looking for new management, which I probably just made harder for myself, I went around the industry asking artists that I trust and I was like, \"Who have you spoken to? Who do you like? Can you name me anyone who actually likes their management?\" There were a few yeses, and I was like, \"Well, that's good to know.\" When the time is ready, maybe I'll go and have a conversation with them.\nThat's the other thing, management has its role if you're ready to do something, and it's going to get complex, and the logistics of it are difficult. If there are a lot of things happening at once. But at the same time, if someone's just going to come in and take over and tell you what to do, and how to dress, and how to present yourself, and what is your strongest single, they might not be the right person for you. And that person can equally damage what you have and what's unique to you. Like I say, one day you can trust someone, but just be very careful and maintain your guard until you know that it's right to let that person in.\n\nSpeaker 6:\tThank you so much.\n\nLauren Martin:\tI'm just quite conscious of time, so if there were anymore, now's a good time.\nNo?\nThank you so much, I really enjoyed that, I genuinely did. And thank you so much for being honest. Everybody, Kindness.2Embed"}, {"name": "War on War", "artist": "Wilco", "lyrics": "War on War Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIt's a war on war\nIt's a war on war\nIt's a war on war\nIt's a war on war\nIt's a war on war\nIt's a war on war\nIt's a war on war\nThere's a war on\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're gonna lose\nYou have to lose\nYou have to learn how to die\n[Verse 2]\nLet's watch the miles flying by\nLet's watch the miles flying by\nYou are not my typewriter\nBut you could be my demon\nMoving forward through flaming doors\n\n[Chorus]\nYou have to lose\nYou have to learn how to die\nIf you want to want to be alive\nOkay\n\n[Chorus]\nYou have to lose\nYou have to lose\nYou have to learn how to die\nIf you want to want to be alive\n\n[Chorus]\nYou have to die\nYou have to die\nYou have to learn how to die\nIf you want to want to be alive\nOkaySee Wilco LiveGet tickets as low as $44You might also like1Embed"}, {"name": "Long Live", "artist": "Taylor Swift", "lyrics": "TranslationsPortugu\u00easHrvatskiFran\u00e7aisLong Live Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI said, \"Remember this moment\"\nIn the back of my mind\nThe time we stood with our shaking hands\nThe crowds in stands went wild\nWe were the kings and the queens\nAnd they read off our names\nThe night you danced like you knew our lives would\nNever be the same\nYou held your head like a hero on a history book page\nIt was the end of a decade\nBut the start of an age\n[Chorus]\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nI was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered\n\n[Verse 2]\nI said, \"Remember this feeling\"\nI pass the pictures around\nOf all the years that we stood there on the sidelines\nWishing for right now\nWe are the kings and the queens\nYou traded your baseball cap for a crown\nWhen they gave us our trophies\nAnd we held them up for our town\nAnd the cynics were outraged\nScreaming, \"This is absurd\"\n'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans\nGot to rule the world\n\n[Chorus]\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nI was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid\nLong live all the mountains we moved\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\nI was screaming, \"Long live that look on your face\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $299You might also like[Bridge]\nHold on to spinning around\nConfetti falls to the ground\nMay these memories break our fall\nWill you take a moment?

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThe cash machine is blue and green\nFor a hundred in twenties and a small service fee\nI could spend three dollars and sixty-three cents\nOn Diet Coca-Cola and unlit cigarettes\nI wonder why we listen to poets when nobody gives a fuck\nHow hot and sorrowful, this machine begs for luck\n\n[Refrain]\nAll my lies are always wishes\nI know I would die if I could come back new\n[Verse 2]\nI want a good life with a nose for things\nFresh wind and bright sky to enjoy my suffering\nA hole without a key if I break my tongue\nSpeaking of tomorrow, how will it ever come?\n\n[Refrain]\nAll my lies are always wishes\nI know I would die if I could come back new\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm down on my hands and knees every time the doorbell rings\nI shake like a toothache when

Sebond\n\nLearning is, indeed, a very great and a very material accomplishment; and those who despise it sufficiently discover their own want of understanding; but learning yet I do not prize it at the excessive rate that some others do, as Herillus, the philosopher, for one, who therein places the sovereign good, and maintained \"That it was only in her to render us wise and contented,\" which I do not believe; no more than I do what others have said, that learning is the mother of all virtue, and that all vice proceeds from ignorance, which, if it be true, required a very long interpretation. My house has long-been open to men of knowledge, and is very well known to them; for my father, who governed it fifty years and upwards, inflamed with the new ardour with which Francis the First embraced letters, and brought them into esteem, with great diligence and expense hunted after the acquaintance of learned men, receiving them into his house as persons sacred, and that had some particular inspiration of divine wisdom; collecting their sayings and sentences as so many oracles, and with so much the greater reverence and religion as he was the less able to judge of them; for he had no knowledge of letters any more than his predecessors. For my part I love them well, but I do not adore them. Amongst others, Peter Bunel, a man of great reputation for knowledge in his time, having, with some others of his sort, staid some days at Montaigne in my father's company, he presented him at his departure with a book, entitled Theologia naturalis; sive Liber Creaturarum, magistri Raimondi de Sebonde. And as the Italian and Spanish tongues were familiar to my father, and as this book was written in a sort of jargon of Spanish with Latin terminations, he hoped that, with a little help, he might be able to understand it, and therefore recommended it to him for a very useful book, and proper tor the time wherein he gave it to him; which was when the novel doctrines of Luther began to be in vogue, and in many places to stagger our ancient belief: wherein he was very well advised, wisely, in his own reason, foreseeing that the beginning of this distemper would easily run into an execrable atheism, for the vulgar, not having the faculty of judging of things, suffering themselves to be carried away by chance and appearance, after having once been inspired with the boldness to despise and control those opinions which they had before had in extreme reverence, such as those wherein their salvation is concerned, and that some of the articles of their religion are brought into doubt and dispute, they afterwards throw all other parts of their belief into the same uncertainty, they having with them no other authority or foundation than the others they had already discomposed; and shake off all the impressions they had received from the authority of the laws, or the reverence of the ancient customs, as a tyrannical yoke:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Nam cupide eonculcatur nimis ante metutum;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"For with most eagerness they spurn the law,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By which they were before most kept in awe;\"\nresolving to admit nothing for the future to which they had not first interposed their own decrees, and given their particular consent.\n\nIt happened that my father, a little before his death, having accidentally found this book under a heap of other neglected papers, commanded me to translate it for him into French. It is good too translate such authors as this, where there is little but the matter itself to express; but such wherein grace of language and elegance of style are aimed at, are dangerous to attempt, especially when a man is to turn them into a weaker idiom. It was a strange and a new undertaking for me; but having by chance at that time nothing else to do, and not being able to resist the command of the best father that ever was, I did it as well as I could; and he was so well pleased with it as to order it to be printed, which after his death was done.\nI found the ideas of this author exceeding fine the contexture of his work well followed, and his design full of piety; and because many people take a delight to read it, and particularly the ladies, to whom we owe the most service, I have often thought to assist them to clear the book of two principal objections made to it. His design is bold and daring, for he undertakes, by human and natural reasons, to establish and make good, against the atheists, all the articles of the Christian religion: wherein, to speak the truth, he is so firm and so successful that I do not think it possible to do better upon that subject; nay, I believe he has been equalled by none. This work seeming to me to be too beautiful and too rich for an author whose name is so little known, and of whom all that we know is that he was a Spaniard, practising physic at Toulouse about two hundred years ago; I enquired of Adrian Turnebus, who knew all things, what he thought of that book; who made answer, \"That he thought it was some abstract drawn from St. Thomas d'Aquin; for that, in truth, his mind, so full of infinite erudition and admirable subtlety, was alone capable of such thoughts.\" Be this as it may, whoever was the author and inventor (and 'tis not reasonable, without greater certainty, to deprive Sebond of that title), he was a man of great judgment and most admirable parts.\n\nThe first thing they reprehend in his work is \"That Christians are to blame to repose their belief upon human reason, which is only conceived by faith and the particular inspiration of divine grace.\" In which objection there appears to be something of zeal to piety, and therefore we are to endeavour to satisfy those who put it forth with the greater mildness and respect. This were a task more proper for a man well read in divinity than for me, who know nothing of it; nevertheless, I conceive that in a thing so divine, so high, and so far transcending all human intelligence, as is that truth, with which it has pleased the bounty of God to enlighten us, it is very necessary that he should moreover lend us his assistance, as a very extraordinary favour and privilege, to conceive and imprint it in our understanding. And I do not believe that means purely human are in any sort capable of doing it: for, if they were, so many rare and excellent souls, and so abundantly furnished with natural force, in former ages, could not have failed, by their reason, to arrive at this knowledge. 'Tis faith alone that livelily mind certainly comprehends the deep mysteries of our religion; but, withal, I do not say that it is not a worthy and very laudable attempt to accommodate those natural and human utensils with which God has endowed us to the service of our faith: it is not to be doubted but that it is the most noble use we can put them to; and that there is not a design in a Christian man more noble than to make it the aim and end of all his studies to extend and amplify the truth of his belief. We do not satisfy ourselves with serving God with our souls and understandings only, we moreover owe and render him a corporal reverence, and apply our limbs and motions, and external things to do him honour; we must here do the same, and accompany our faith with all the reason we have, but always with this reservation, not to fancy that it is upon us that it depends, nor that our arguments and endeavours can arrive at so supernatural and divine a knowledge. If it enters not into us by an extraordinary infusion; if it enters not only by reason, but, moreover, by human ways, it is not in us in its true dignity and splendour: and yet, I am afraid, we only have it by this way.\n\nIf we hold upon God by the mediation of a lively faith; if we hold upon God by him, and not by us; if we had a divine basis and foundation, human occasions would not have the power to shake us as they do; our fortress would not surrender to so weak a battery; the love of novelty, the constraint of princes, the success of one party, and the rash and fortuitous change of our opinions, would not have the power to stagger and alter our belief: we should not then leave it to the mercy of every new argument, nor abandon it to all the rhetoric in the world; we should withstand the fury of these waves with an immovable and unyielding constancy:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  As a great rock repels the rolling tides,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   That foam and bark about her marble sides,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  From its strong bulk\nIf we were but touched with this ray of divinity, it would appear throughout; not only our words, but our works also, would carry its brightness and lustre; whatever proceeded from us would be seen illuminated with this noble light. We ought to be ashamed that, in all the human sects, there never was any of the faction, that did not, in some measure, conform his life and behaviour to it, whereas so divine and heavenly an institution does only distinguish Christians by the name! Will you see the proof of this? Compare our manners to those of a Mahometan or Pagan, you will still find that we fall very\n\nshort; there, where, out of regard to the reputation and advantage of our religion, we ought to shine in excellency at a vast distance beyond all others: and that it should be said of us, \"Are they so just, so charitable, so good: Then they are Christians.\" All other signs are common to all religions; hope, trust, events, ceremonies, penance,\n\nmartyrs. The peculiar mark of our truth ought to be our virtue, as it is also the most heavenly and difficult, and the most worthy product of truth. For this our good St. Louis was in the right, who, when the Tartar king, who was become Christian, designed to come to Lyons to kiss the Pope's feet, and there to be an eye-witness of the sanctity he hoped to find in our manner, immediately diverted him from his purpose; for fear lest our disorderly way of living should, on the contrary, put him out of conceit with so holy a belief! And yet it happened quite otherwise since to that other, who, going to Rome, to the same end, and there seeing the dissoluteness of the prelates and people of that time, settled himself so much the more firmly in our religion, considering how great the force and divinity of it must necessarily be that could maintain its dignity and splendour among so much corruption, and in so vicious hands. If we had but one single grain of faith, we should remove mountains from their places, saith the sacred Word; our actions, that would then be directed and accompanied by the divinity, would not be merely human, they would have in them something of miraculous, as well as our belief: Brevis est institutio vit honest beauque, si credos. \"Believe, and the way to happiness and virtue is a short one.\" Some impose upon the world that they believe that which they do not; others, more in number, make themselves believe that they believe, not being able to penetrate into what it is to believe. We think it strange if, in the civil war which, at this time, disorders our state, we see events float and vary aller a common and ordinary manner; which is because we bring nothing to it but our own. Justice, which is in one party, is only there for ornament and palliation; it, is, indeed, pretended, but 'tis not there received, settled and espoused: it is there, as in the mouth of an advocate, not as in the heart and affection of the party. God owes his extraordinary assistance to faith and religion; not to our passions. Men there are the conductors, and therein serve themselves with religion, whereas it ought to be quite contrary. Observe, if it be not by our own hands that we guide and train it, and draw it like wax into so many contrary figures, from a rule in itself so direct and firm. When and where was this more manifest than in France in our days? They who have taken it on the left hand, they who have taken it on the right; they who call it black, they who call it white, alike employ it to their violent and ambitious designs, conduct it with a progress, so conform in riot and injustice that they render the diversity they pretended in their opinions, in a thing whereon the conduct and rule of our life depends, doubtful and hard to believe. Did one ever see, come from the same school and discipline, manners more united, and more the same? Do but observe with what horrid impudence we toss divine arguments to and fro, and how irreligiously we have both rejected and retaken them, accord\u2014as fortune has shifted our places in these intestine storms.\n\nThis so solemn proposition, \"Whether it be lawful for a subject to rebel and take up arms against his prince for the defence of his religion,\" do you remember in whose mouths, the last year, the affirmative of it was the prop of one party, and the negative the pillar of another? And hearken now from what quarter comes the voice and instruction of the one and the other, and if arms make less noise and rattle for this cause than for that. We condemn those to the fire who say that truth must be made to bear the yoke of our necessity; and how much worse does France than say it? Let us confess the truth; whoever should draw out from the army, even that raised by the king, those who take up arms out of pure zeal to religion, and also those who only do it to protect the laws of their country, or for the service of their prince, could hardly, out of both these put together, make one complete company of gens-d'armes. Whence does this proceed, that there are so few to be found who have maintained the same will and the same progress in our civil commotions, and that we see them one while move but a foot-pace, and another run full speed? and the same men one while damage our affairs by their violent heat and fierceness, and another by their coldness, gentleness, and slowness; but that they are pushed on by particular and casual considerations, according to the variety wherein they move?\n\nI evidently perceive that we do not willingly afford devotion any other offices but those that least suit with our own passions.\n\nThere hostility so admirable as the Christian. Our zeal performs wonders, when it seconds our inclinations to hatred, cruelty, ambition, avarice, detraction, and rebellion: but when it moves, against the hair, towards bounty, benignity, and temperance, unless, by miracle, some rare and virtuous disposition prompts us to it, we stir neither hand nor toot. Our religion is intended to extirpate vices, whereas it screens, nourishes, and incites them. We must not mock God. If we believed in him, I do not say by faith, but with a simple belief, that is to say (and I speak it to our great shame) if we believed in him and recognised him as we do any other history, or as we would do one of our companions, we should love him above all other things for the infinite bounty and beauty that shines in him;\u2014at least, he would go equal in our affection with riches, pleasure, glory, and our friends. The best of us is not so much afraid to outrage him as he is afraid to injure his neighbour, his kinsman, or his master. Is there any understanding so weak that, having on one side the object of one of our vicious pleasures, and on the other (in equal knowledge and persuasion) the state of an immortal glory, would change the first for the other? and yet we often renounce this out of mere contempt: for what lust tempts us to blaspheme, if not, perhaps, the very desire to offend. The philosopher Antisthenes, as he was being initiated in the mysteries of Orpheus, the priest telling him, \"That those who professed themselves of that religion were certain to receive perfect and eternal felicity after death,\"\u2014\"If thou believest that,\" answered he, \"why dost thou not die thyself?\" Diogenes, more rudely, according to his manner, and more remote from our purpose, to the priest that in like manner preached to him, \"To become of his religion, that he might obtain the happiness of the other world;\u2014\"What!\" said he, \"thou wouldest have me to believe that Agesilaus and Epaminondas, who were so great men, shall be miserable, and that thou, who art but a calf, and canst do nothing to purpose, shalt be happy, because thou art a priest?\" Did we receive these great promises of eternal beatitude with the same reverence and respect that we do a philosophical discourse, we should not have death in so great horror:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non jam se moriens dissolvi conqurreretur;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sed magis ire foras, stemque relinquere ut angais,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gauderet, prealonga senex aut cornua cervus.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"We should not on a death bed grieve to be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Dissolved, but rather launch out cheerfully\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From our old hut, and with the snake, be glad\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  To cast off the corrupted slough we had;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Or with th' old stag rejoice to be now clear\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  From the large horns, too ponderous grown to bear.\"\n\"I desire to be dissolved,\" we should say, \"and to be with Jesus Christ\" The force of Plato's arguments concerning the immortality of the soul set some of his disciples to seek a premature grave, that they might the sooner enjoy the things he had made them hope for.\n\nAll this is a most evident sign that we only receive our religion after our own fashion, by our own hands, and no otherwise than as other religions are received. Either we are happened in the country where it is in practice, or we reverence the antiquity of it, or the authority of the men who have maintained it, or fear the menaces it fulminates against misbelievers, or are allured by its promises. These considerations ought, 'tis true, to be applied to our belief but as subsidiaries only, for they are human obligations. Another religion, other witnesses, the like promises and threats, might, by the same way, imprint a quite contrary belief. We are Christians by the same title that we are Perigordians or Germans. And what Plato says, \"That there are few men so obstinate in their atheism whom a pressing danger will not reduce to an acknowledgment of the divine power,\" does not concern a true Christian: 'tis for mortal and human religions to be received by human recommendation. What kind of faith can that be that cowardice and want of courage establish in us? A pleasant faith, that does not believe what it believes but for want of courage to disbelieve it! Can a vicious passion, such as inconstancy and astonishment, cause any regular product in our souls? \"They are confident in their judgment,\" says he, \"that what is said of hell and future torments is all feigned: but an occasion of making the expedient presenting itself, when old age or diseases bring them to the brink of the grave, the terror of death, by the horror of that future condition, inspires them with a new belief!\" And by reason that such impressions render them timorous, he forbids in his Laws all such threatening doctrines, and all persuasion that anything of ill can befall a man from the gods, excepting for his great good when they happen to him, and for a medicinal effect. They say of Bion that, infected with the atheism of Theodoras, he had long had religious men in great scorn and contempt, but that death surprising him, he gave himself up to the most extreme superstition; as if the gods withdrew and returned according to the necessities of Bion. Plato and these examples would conclude that we are brought to a belief of God either by reason or by force. Atheism being a proposition as unnatural as monstrous, difficult also and hard to establish in the human understanding, how arrogant soever, there are men enough seen, out of vanity and pride, to be the authors of extraordinary and reforming opinions, and outwardly to affect the profession of them; who, if they are such fools, have, nevertheless, not the power to plant them in their own conscience. Yet will they not fail to lift up their hands towards heaven if you give them a good thrust with a sword in the breast, and when fear or sickness has abated and dulled the licentious fury of this giddy humour they will easily re-unite, and very discreetly suffer themselves to be reconciled to the public faith and examples. A doctrine seriously digested is one thing, and those superficial impressions another; which springing from the disorder of an unhinged understanding, float at random and great uncertainty in the fancy. Miserable and senseless men, who strive to be worse than they can!\n\nThe error of paganism and the ignorance of our sacred truth, let this great soul of Plato, but great only in human greatness, fall also into this other mistake, \"That children and old men were most susceptible of religion,\" as if it sprung and derived its credit from our weakness. The knot that ought to bind the judgment and the will, that ought to restrain the soul and join it to our creator, should be a knot that derives its foldings and strength not from our considerations, from our reasons and passions, but from a divine and supernatural constraint, having but one form, one face, and one lustre, which is the authority of God and his divine grace. Now the heart and soul being governed and commanded by faith, 'tis but reason that they should muster all our other faculties, according as they are able to perform to the service and assistance of their design. Neither is it to be imagined that all this machine has not some marks imprinted upon it by the hand of the mighty architect, and that there is not in the things of this world some image that in some measure resembles the workman who has built and formed them. He has, in his stupendous works, left the character of his divinity, and 'tis our own weakness only that hinders us from discerning it. 'Tis what he himself is pleased to tell us, \"That he manifests his invisible operations to us by those that are visible.\" Sebond applied himself to this laudable and noble study, and demonstrates to us that there is not any part or member of the world that disclaims or derogates from its maker. It were to do wrong to the divine goodness, did not the universe consent to our belief. The heavens, the earth, the elements, our bodies and our souls,\u2014all things concur to this; we have but to find out the way to use them; they instruct us, if we are capable of instruction. For this world is a sacred temple, into which man is introduced, there to contemplate statues, not the works of a mortal hand, but such as the divine purpose has made the objects of sense; the sun, the stars, the water, and the earth, to represent those that are intelligible to us. \"The invisible tilings of God,\" says St. Paul, \"appear by the creation of the world, his eternal wisdom and divinity being considered by his works.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And God himself envies not men the grace\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of seeing and admiring heaven's face;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  But, rolling it about, he still anew\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Presents its varied splendour to our view,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And on oar minds himself inculcates, so\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  That we th' Almighty mover well may know:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instructing us by seeing him the cause\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Of ill, to revcreoce and obey his laws.\"\nNow our prayers and human discourses are but as sterile and undigested matter. The grace of God is the form; 'tis that which gives fashion and value to it. As the virtuous actions of Socrates and Cato remain vain and fruitless, for not having had the love and obedience to the true creator of all things, so is it with our imaginations and discourses; they have a kind of body, but it is an inform mass, without fashion and without light, if faith and grace be not added thereto. Faith coming to tinct and illustrate Sehond's arguments renders them firm and stolid; and to that degree that they are capable of serving for directions, and of being the first guides to an elementary Christian to put him into the way of this knowledge. They in some measure form him to, and render him capable of, the grace of God, by which means he afterwards completes and perfects himself in the true belief. I know a man of authority, bred up to letters, who has confessed to me to have been brought back from the errors of unbelief by Sebond's arguments. And should they be stripped of this ornament, and of the assistance and approbation of the faith, and be looked upon as mere fancies only, to contend with those who are precipitated into the dreadful and horrible darkness of irrligion, they will even there find them as solid and firm as any others of the same quality that can be opposed against them; so that we shall be ready to say to our opponents:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Si melius quid habes, arcesse; vel imperium fer:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"If you have arguments more fit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Produce them, or to these submit.\"\nlet them admit the force of our reasons, or let them show us others, and upon some other subject, better woven and of finer thread. I am, unawares, half engaged in the second objection, to which I proposed to make answer in the behalf of Sebond. Some say that his arguments are weak, and unable to make good what he intends, and undertake with great ease to confute them. These are to be a little more roughly handled, for they are more dangerous and malicious than the first Men willingly wrest the sayings of others to favour their own prejudicate opinions. To an atheist all writings tend to atheism: he corrupts the most innocent matter with his own venom. These have their judgments so prepossessed that they cannot relish Sebond's reasons. As to the rest, they think we give them very fair play in putting them into the liberty of combatting our religion with weapons merely human, whom, in her majesty, full of authority and command, they durst not attack. The means that I shall use, and that I think most proper to subdue this frenzy, is to crush and spurn under foot pride and human arrogance; to make them sensible of the inanity, vanity, and vileness of man; to wrest the wretched arms of their reason out of their hands; to make them bow down and bite the ground under the authority and reverence of the Divine Majesty. 'Tis to that alone that knowledge and wisdom appertain; that alone that can make a true estimate of itself, and from which we purloin whatever we value ourselves upon: [\u2014Greek\u2014] \"God permits not any being but himself to be truly wise.\" Let us subdue this presumption, the first foundation of the tyranny of the evil spirit Deus superbis re-sistit, humilibus autem dal gratiam. \"God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.\" \"Understanding is in the gods,\" says Plato, \"and not at all, or very little, in men.\" Now it is in the mean time a great consolation to a Christian man to see our frail and mortal parts so fitly suited to our holy and divine faith that, when we employ them to the subjects of their own mortal and frail nature they are not even there more unitedly or more firmly adjusted. Let us see, then, if man has in his power other more forcible and convincing reasons than those of Sebond; that is to say, if it be in him to arrive at any certainty by argument and reason. For St. Augustin, disputing against these people, has good cause to reproach them with injustice, \"In that they maintain the part of our belief to be false that our reason cannot establish.\" And to show that a great many things may be, and have been, of which our nature could not sound the reason and causes, he proposes to them certain known and undoubted experiments, wherein men confess they see nothing; and this he does, as all other things, with a curious and ingenious inquisition. We must do more than this, and make them know that, to convince the weakness of their reason, there is no necessity of culling out uncommon examples: and that it is so defective and so blind that there is no faculty clear enough for it; that to it the easy and the hard are all one; that all subjects equally, and nature in general, disclaim its authority and reject its mediation.\nWhat does truth mean when she preaches to us to fly worldly philosophy, when she so often inculcates to us, \"That our wisdom is but folly in the sight of God: that the vainest of all vanities is man: that the man who presumes upon his wisdom does not yet know what wisdom is; and that man, who is nothing, if he thinks himself to be anything, does seduce and deceive himself.\" These sentences of the Holy Spirit do so clearly and vividly express that which I would maintain that I should need no other proof against men who would with all humility and obedience submit to his authority: but these will be whipped at their own expense, and will not suffer a man to oppose their reason but by itself.\n\nLet us then, for once, consider a man alone, without foreign assistance, armed only with his own proper arms, and unfurnished of the divine grace and wisdom, which is all his honour, strength, and the foundation of his being. Let us see how he stands in this fine equipage. Let him make me understand, by the force of his reason, upon what foundations he has built those great advantages he thinks he has over other creatures. Who has made him believe that this admirable motion of the celestial arch, the eternal light of those luminaries that roll so high over his head, the wondrous and fearful motions of that infinite ocean, should be established and continue so many ages for his service and convenience? Can any thing be imagined so ridiculous, that this miserable and wretched creature, who is not so much as master of himself, but subject to the injuries of all things, should call himself master and emperor of the world, of which he has not power to know the least part, much less to command the whole? And the privilege which he attributes to himself of being the only creature in this vast fabric who has the understanding to discover the beauty and the paris of it; the only one who can return thanks to the architect, and keep account of the revenues and disbursements of the world; who, I wonder, sealed him this patent? Let us see his commission for this great employment Was it granted in favour of the wise only? Few people will be concerned in it. Are fools and wicked persons worthy so extraordinary a favour, and, being the worst part of the world, to be preferred before the rest? Shall we believe this man?\u2014\"For whose sake shall we, therefore, conclude that the world was made?

How subject its essence and condition to our knowledge?\nWhatever we see in those bodies astonishes us: Qu molitio, qua ferramenta, qui vectes, qu machina, qui ministri tanti operis fuerunt? \"What contrivance, what tools, what materials, what engines, were employed about so stupendous a work?\" Why do we deprive them of soul, of life, and discourse? Have we discovered in them any immoveable or insensible stupidity, we who have no commerce with them but by obedience? Shall we say that we have discovered in no other creature but man the use of a reasonable soul? What! have we seen any thing like the sun? Does he cease to be, because we have seen nothing like him? And do his motions cease, because there are no other like them? If what we have not seen is not, our knowledge is marvellously contracted: Qu sunt tant animi angusti! \"How narrow are our understandings!\" Are they not dreams of human vanity, to make the moon a celestial earth? there to fancy mountains and vales, as Anaxagoras did? there to fix habitations and human abodes, and plant colonies for our convenience, as Plato and Plutarch have done? And of our earth to make a luminous and resplendent star? \"Amongst the other inconveniences of mortality this is one, that darkness of the understanding which leads men astray, not so much from a necessity of erring, but from a love of error.\nThe corruptible body stupifies the soul, and the earthly habitation dulls the faculties of the imagination.\"\n\nPresumption is our natural and original disease. The most wretched and frail of all creatures is man, and withal the proudest. He feels and sees himself lodged here in the dirt and filth of the world, nailed and rivetted to the worst and deadest part of the universe, in the lowest story of the house, the most remote from the heavenly arch, with animals of the worst condition of the three; and yet in his imagination will be placing himself above the circle of the moon, and bringing the heavens under his feet. 'Tis by the same vanity of imagination that he equals himself to God, attributes to himself divine qualities, withdraws and separates himself from the the crowd of other creatures, cuts out the shares of the animals, his fellows and companions, and distributes to them portions of faculties and force, as himself thinks fit How does he know, by the strength of his understanding, the secret and internal motions of animals?\u2014from what comparison betwixt them and us does he conclude the stupidity he attributes to them? When I play with my cat who knows whether I do not make her more sport than she makes me? We mutually divert one another with our play. If I have my hour to begin or to refus, she also has hers. Plato, in his picture of the golden age under Saturn, reckons, among the chief advantages that a man then had, his communication with beasts, of whom, inquiring and informing himself, he knew the true qualities and differences of them all, by which he acquired a very perfect intelligence and prudence, and led his life more happily than we could do. Need we a better proof to condemn human impudence in the concern of beasts? This great author was of opinion that nature, for the most part in the corporal form she gave them, had only regard to the use of prognostics that were derived thence in his time. The defect that hinders communication betwixt them and us, why may it not be in our part as well as theirs? 'Tis yet to determine where the fault lies that we understand not one another,\u2014for we understand them no more than they do us; and by the same reason they may think us to be beasts as we think them. 'Tis no great wonder if we understand not them, when we do not understand a Basque or a Troglodyte. And yet some have boasted that they understood them, as Apollonius Tyanaus, Melampus, Tiresias, Thales, and others. And seeing, as cusmographers report, that there are nations that have a dog for their king, they must of necessity be able to interpret his voice and motions. We must observe the parity betwixt us, have some tolerable apprehension of their meaning, and so have beasts of ours,\u2014much about the same. They caress us, threaten us, and beg of us, and we do the same to them.\n\nAs to the rest, we manifestly discover that they have a full and absolute communication amongst themselves, and that they perfectly understand one another, not only those of the same, but of divers kinds:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The tamer herds, and wilder sort of brutes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Though we of higher race conclude them mutes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yet utter dissonant and various notes,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From gentler lungs or more distended throats,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  As fear, or grief, or anger, do them move,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Or as they do approach the joys of love.\"\nIn one kind of barking of a dog the horse knows there is anger, of another sort of bark he is not afraid. Even in the very beasts that have no voice at all, we easily conclude, from the society of offices we observe amongst them, some other sort of communication: their very motions discover it:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"As infants who, for want of words, devise\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Expressive motions with their hands and eyes.\"\nAnd why not, as well as our dumb people, dispute, argue, and tell stories by signs? Of whom I have seen some, by practice, so clever and active that way that, in fact, they wanted nothing of the perfection of making themselves understood.

There is not a motion that does not speak, and in an intelligible language without discipline, and a public language that every one understands: whence it should follow, the variety and use distinguished from others considered, that these should rather be judged the property of human nature. I omit what necessity particularly does suddenly suggest to those who are in need;\u2014the alphabets upon the fingers, grammars in gesture, and the sciences which are only by them exercised and expressed; and the nations that Pliny reports have no other language. An ambassador of the city of Abdera, after a long conference with Agis, King of Sparta, demanded of him, \"Well, sir, what answer must I return to my fellow-citizens?\" \"That I have given thee leave,\" said he, \"to say what thou wouldest, and as much as thou wouldest, without ever speaking a word.\" is not this a silent speaking, and very easy to be understood?\n\nAs to the rest, what is there in us that we do not see in the operations of animals? Is there a polity better ordered, the offices better distributed, and more inviolably observed and maintained, than that of bees? Can we imagine that such, and so regular, a distribution of employments can be carried on without reasoning and deliberation?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hence to the bee some sages have assign'd\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Some portion of the god and heavenly wind.\"\nThe swallows that we see at the return of the spring, searching all the corners of our houses for the most commodious places wherein to build their nest; do they seek without judgment, and amongst a thousand choose out the most proper for their purpose, without discretion? And in that elegant and admirable contexture of their buildings, can birds rather make choice of a square figure than a round, of an obtuse than of a right angle, without knowing their properties and effects? Do they bring water, and then clay, without knowing that the hardness of the latter grows softer by being wetted? Do they mat their palace with moss or down without foreseeing that their tender young will lie more safe and easy? Do they secure themselves from the wet and rainy winds, and place their lodgings against the east, without knowing the different qualities of the winds, and considering that one is more wholesome than another? Why does the spider make her web tighter in one place, and slacker in another; why now make one sort of knot, and then another, if she has not deliberation, thought, and conclusion? We sufficiently discover in most of their works how much animals excel us, and how unable our art is to imitate them. We see, nevertheless, in our rougher performances, that we employ all our faculties, and apply the utmost power of our souls; why do we not conclude the same of them?\n\nWhy should we attribute to I know not what natural and servile inclination the works that excel all we can do by nature and art? wherein, without being aware, we give them a mighty advantage over us in making nature, with maternal gentleness and love, accompany and learn them, as it were, by the hand to all the actions and commodities of their life, whilst she leaves us to chance and fortune, and to seek out by art the things that are necessary to our conservation, at the same time denying us the means of being able, by any instruction or effort of understanding, to arrive at the natural sufficiency of beasts; so that their brutish stupidity surpasses, in all conveniences, all that our divine intelligence can do. Really, at this rate, we might with great reason call her an unjust stepmother: but it is nothing so, our polity is not so irregular and unformed.\n\nNature has universally cared for all her creatures, and there is not one she has not amply furnished with all means necessary for the conservation of its being. For the common complaints I hear men make (as the license of their opinions one while lifts them up above the clouds, and then again depresses them to the antipodes), that we are the only animal abandoned naked upon the bare earth, tied and bound, not having wherewithal to arm and clothe us but by the spoil of others; whereas nature has covered all other creatures either with shells, husks, bark, hair, wool, prickles, leather, down, feathers, scales, or silk, according to the necessities of their being; has armed them with talons, teeth, or horns, wherewith to assault and defend, and has herself taught them that which is most proper for them, to swim, to run, to fly, and sing, whereas man neither knows how to walk, speak, eat, or do any thing but weep, without teaching;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Like to the wretched mariner, when toss'd\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By raging seas upon the desert coast,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tender babe lies naked on the earth,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of all supports of life stript by his birth;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When nature first presents him to the day,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Freed from the cell wherein before he lay,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  He fills the ambient air with doleful cries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Foretelling thus life's future miseries;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   But beasts, both wild and tame, greater and less,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Do of themselves in strength and bulk increase;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   They need no rattle, nor the broken chat,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Ay which the nurse first teaches boys to prate\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   They look not out for different robes to wear,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   According to the seasons of the year;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And need no arms nor walls their goods to save,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Since earth and liberal nature ever have,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And will, in all abundance, still produce\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All things whereof they can have need or use:\"\nthese complaints are false; there is in the polity of the world a greater equality and more uniform relation. Our skins are as sufficient to defend us from the injuries of the weather as theirs are; witness several nations that yet know not the use of clothes. Our ancient Gauls were but slenderly clad, any more than the Irish, our neighbours, though in so cold a climate; but we may better judge of this by ourselves: for all those parts that we are pleased to expose to the air are found very able to endure it: the face, the feet, the hands, the arms, the head, according to the various habit; if there be a tender part about us, and that would seem to be in danger from cold, it should be the stomach where the digestion is; and yet our forefathers were there always open, and our ladies, as tender and delicate as they are, go sometimes half-bare as low as the navel. Neither is the binding or swathing of infants any more necessary; and the Lacedmoman mothers brought theirs in all liberty of motion of members, without any ligature at all. Our crying is common with the greatest part of other animals, and there are but few creatures that are not observed to groan, and bemoan themselves a long time after they come into the world; forasmuch as it is a behaviour suitable to the weakness wherein they find themselves. As to the custom of eating, it is in us, as in them, natural, and without instruction;\n\n\"For every one soon finds his natural force.\nWhich he, or better may employ, or worse.\"\nWho doubts but an infant, arrived to the strength of feeding himself, may make shift to find something to eat And the earth produces and offers him wherewithal to supply his necessity, without other culture and artifice; and if not at all times, no more does she do it to beasts, witness the provision we see ants and other creatures hoard up against the dead seasons of the year. The late discovered nations, so abundantly furnished with natural meat and drink, without care, or without cookery, may give us to understand that bread is not our only food, and that, without tillage, our mother nature has provided us sufficiently of all we stand in need of: nay, it appears more fully and plentifully than she does at present, now that we have added our own industry:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \"The earth did first spontaneously afford\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Choice fruits and wines to furnish out the board;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  With herbs and flow'rs unsown in verdant fields.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But scarce by art so good a harvest yields;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Though men and oxen mutually have strove,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  With all their utmost force the soil t' improve,\"\nthe debauchery and irregularity of our appetites outstrips all the inventions we can contrive to satisfy it.\n\nAs to arms, we have more natural ones than than most other animals more various motions of limbs, and naturally and without lesson extract more service from them. Those that are trained to fight naked are seen to throw themselves into the like hazards that we do. If some beasts surpass us in this advantage, we surpass many others. And the industry of fortifying the body, and covering it by acquired means, we have by instinct and natural precept? That it is so, the elephant shows who sharpen, and whets the teeth he makes use of in war (for he has particular ones for that service, which he spares, and never employs them at all to any other use); when bulls go to fight, they toss and throw the dust about them; boars whet their tusks; and the ichneumon, when he is about to engage with the crocodile, fortifies his body, and covers and crusts it all over with close-wrought and well-tempered slime, as with a cuirass. Why shall we not say that it is also natural for us to arm ourselves with wood and iron?\n\nAs to speech, it is certain that if it be not natural it is not necessary. Nevertheless I believe that a child which had been brought up in an absolute solitude, remote from all society of men (which would be an experiment very hard to make), would have some kind of speech to express his meaning by. And 'tis not to be supposed that nature should have denied that to us which she has given to several other animals: for what is this faculty we observe in them, of complaining, rejoicing, calling to one another for succour, and inviting each other to love, which they do with the voice, other than speech? And why should they not speak to one another? They speak to us, and we to them. In how many several sorts of ways do we speak to our dogs, and they answer us? We converse with them in another sort of language, and use other appellations, than we do with birds, hogs, oxen, horses, and alter the idiom according to the kind.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"Thus from one swarm of ants some sally out.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  To spy another's stock or mark its rout.\"\nLactantius seems to attribute to beasts not only speech, but laughter also. And the difference of language which is seen amongst us, according to the difference of countries, is also observed in animals of the same kind. Aristotle, in proof of this, instances the Various calls of partridges, according to the situation of places:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \"And various birds do from their warbling throats\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At various times, utter quite different notes,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And some their hoarse songs with the seasons change.\"\nBut it is yet to be known what language this child would speak; and of that what is said by guess has no great appearance. If a man will allege to me, in opposition to this opinion, that those who are naturally deaf speak not, I answer that this is not only because they could not receive the instruction of speaking by ear, but rather because the sense of hearing, of which they are deprived, relates to that of speaking, and that these hold together by a natural and inseparable tie, in such manner that what we speak we must first speak to ourselves within, and make it sound in our own ears, before we can utter it to others.\n\nAll this I have said to prove the resemblance there is in human things, and to bring us back and join us to the crowd. We are neither above nor below the rest All that is under heaven, says the sage, runs one law and one fortune:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"All things remain\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bound and entangled in one fatal chain.\"\nThere is, indeed, some difference,\u2014there are several orders and degrees; but it is under the aspect of one and the same nature:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"All things by their own rites proceed, and draw\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Towards their ends, by nature's certain law.\"\nMan must be compelled and restrained within the bounds of this polity. Miserable creature! he is not in a condition really to step over the rail. He is fettered and circumscribed, he is subjected to the same necessity that the other creatures of his rank and order are, and of a very mean condition, without any prerogative of true and real pre-eminence. That which he attributes to himself, by vain fancy and opinion, has neither body nor taste. And if it be so, that he only, of all the animals, has this liberty of imagination and irregularity of thoughts, representing to him that which is, that which is not, and that he would have, the false and the true, 'tis an advantage dearly bought, and of which he has very little reason to be proud; for thence springs the principal and original fountain of all the evils that befal him,\u2014sin, sickness, irresolution, affliction, despair. I say, then, to return to my subject, that there is no appearance to induce a man to believe that beasts should, by a natural and forced inclination, do the same things that we do by our choice and industry. We ought from like effects to conclude like faculties, and from greater effects greater faculties; and consequently confess that the same reasoning, and the same ways by which we operate, are common with them, or that they have others that are better. Why should we imagine this natural constraint in them, who experience no such effect in ourselves? added that it is more honourable to be guided and obliged to act regularly by a natural and inevitable condition, and nearer allied to the divinity, than to act regularly by a temerarious and fortuitous liberty, and more safe to entrust the reins of our conduct in the hands of nature than our own. The vanity of our presumption makes us prefer rather to owe our sufficiency to our own exertions than to her bounty, and to enrich the other animals with natural goods, and abjure them in their favour, in order to honour and ennoble ourselves with goods acquired, very foolishly in my opinion; for I should as much value parts and virtues naturally and purely my own as those I had begged and obtained from education. It is not in our power to obtain a nobler reputation than to be favoured of God and nature.\n\nFor instance, take the fox, the people of Thrace make use of when they wish to pass over the ice of some frozen river, and turn him out before them to that purpose; when we see him lay his ear upon the bank of the river, down to the ice, to listen if from a more remote or nearer distance he can hear the noise of the waters' current, and, according as he finds by that the ice to be of a less or greater thickness, to retire or advance,\u2014have we not reason to believe thence that the same rational thoughts passed through his head that we should have upon the like occasions; and that it is a ratiocination and consequence, drawn from natural sense, that that which makes a noise runs, that which runs is not frozen, what is not frozen is liquid, and that which is liquid yields to impression! For to attribute this to a mere quickness of the sense of hearing, without reason and consequence, is a chimra that cannot enter into the imagination. We are to suppose the same of the many sorts of subtleties and inventions with which beasts secure themselves from, and frustrate, the enterprizes we plot against them.\n\nAnd if we will make an advantage even of this, that it is in our power to seize them, to employ them in our service, and to use them at our pleasure, 'tis still but the same advantage we have over one another.\nWe have our slaves upon these terms: the Climacid, were they not women in Syria who, squat on all fours, served for a ladder or footstool, by which the ladies mounted their coaches? And the greatest part of free persons surrender, for very trivial conveniences, their life and being into the power of another.\nThe wives and concubines of the Thracians contended who should be chosen to be slain upon their husband's tomb. Have tyrants ever failed of finding men enough vowed to their devotion? some of them moreover adding this necessity, of accompanying them in death as well as life? Whole armies have bound themselves after this manner to their captains. The form of the oath in the rude school of gladiators was in these words: \"We swear to suffer ourselves to be chained, burnt, wounded, and killed with the sword, and to endure all that true gladiators suffer from their master, religiously engaging both body and soul in his service.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Uire meum, si vis, flamma caput, et pete ferro\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Corpus, et iutorto verbere terga seca.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"Wound me with steel, or burn my head with fire.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Or scourge my shoulders with well-twisted wire.\"\nThis was an obligation indeed, and yet there, in one year, ten thousand entered into it, to their destruction. When the Scythians interred their king they strangled upon his body the most beloved of his concubines, his cup-bearer, the master of his horse, his chamberlain, the usher of his chamber, and his cook. And upon the anniversary thereof they killed fifty horses, mounted by fifty pages, that they had impaled all up the spine of the back to the throat, and there left them fixed in triumph about his tomb. The men that serve us do it cheaper, and for a less careful and favourable usage than what we treat our hawks, horses and dogs withal. To what solicitude do we not submit for the conveniences of these? I do not think that servants of the most abject condition would willingly do that for their masters that princes think it an honour to do for their beasts. Diogenes seeing his relations solicitous to redeem, him from servitude: \"They are fools,\" said he; \"'tis he that keeps and nourishes me that in reality serves me.\" And they who entertain beasts ought rather to be said to serve them, than to be served by them. And withal in this these have something more generous in that one lion never submitted to another lion, nor one horse to another, for want of courage. As we go to the chase of beasts, so do tigers and lions to the chase of men, and do the same execution upon one another; dogs upon hares, pikes upon tench, swallows upon grass-hoppers, and sparrow-hawks upon blackbirds and larks:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"The stork with snakes and lizards from the wood\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And pathless wilds supports her callow brood,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  While Jove's own eagle, bird of noble blood,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Scours the wide country for undaunted food;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Sweeps the swift hare or swifter fawn away,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And feeds her nestlings with the generous prey.\"\nWe divide the quarry, as well as the pains and labour of the chase, with our hawks and hounds. And about Amphipolis, in Thrace, the hawkers and wild falcons equally divide the prey in the half. As also along the lake Motis, if the fisherman does not honestly leave the wolves an equal share of what he has caught, they presently go and tear his nets in pieces. And as we have a way of sporting that is carried on more by subtlety than force, as springing hares, and angling with line and hook, there is also the like amongst other animals. Aristotle says that the cuttle-fish casts a gut out of her throat as long as a line, which she extends and draws back at pleasure; and as she perceives some little fish approach her she lets it nibble upon the end of this gut, lying herself concealed in the sand or mud, and by little and little draws it in, till the little fish is so near her that at one spring she may catch it.\n\nAs to strength, there is no creature in the world exposed to so many injuries as man. We need not a whale, elephant, or a crocodile, nor any such-like animals, of which one alone is sufficient to dispatch a great number of men, to do our business; lice are sufficient to vacate Sylla's dictatorship; and the heart and life of a great and triumphant emperor is the breakfast of a little contemptible worm!\n\nWhy should we say that it is only for man, or knowledge built up by art and meditation, to distinguish the things useful for his being, and proper for the cure of his diseases, and those which are not; to know the virtues of rhubarb and polypody. When we see the goats of Candia, when wounded with an arrow, among a million of plants choose out dittany for their cure; and the tortoise, when she has eaten a viper, immediately go out to look for origanum to purge her; the dragon to rub and clear his eyes with fennel; the storks to give themselves clysters of sea-water; the elephants to draw not only out of their own bodies, and those of their companions, but out of the bodies of their masters too (witness the elephant of King Porus whom Alexander defeated), the darts and javelins thrown at them in battle, and that so dexterously that we ourselves could not do it with so little pain to the patient;\u2014why do we not say here also that this is knowledge and reason? For to allege, to their disparagement, that 'tis by the sole instruction and dictate of nature that they know all this, is not to take from them the dignity of knowledge and reason, but with greater force to attribute it to them than to us, for the honour of so infallible a mistress. Chrysippus, though in other things as scornful a judge of the condition of animals as any other philosopher whatever, considering the motions of a dog, who coming to a place where three ways met, either to hunt after his master he has lost, or in pursuit of some game that flies before him, goes snuffing first in one of the ways, and then in another, and, after having made himself sure of two, without finding the trace of what he seeks, dashes into the third without examination, is forced to confess that this reasoning is in the dog: \"I have traced my master to this place; he must of necessity be gone one of these three ways; he is not gone this way nor that, he must then infallibly be gone this other;\" and that assuring himself by this conclusion, he makes no use of his nose in the third way, nor ever lays it to the ground, but suffers himself to be carried on there bv the force of reason. This sally, purely logical, and this use of propositions divided and conjoined, and the right enumeration of parts, is it not every whit as good that the dog knows all this of himself as well as from Trapezuntius?\n\nAnimals are not incapable, however, of being instructed after our method. We teach blackbirds, ravens, pies, and parrots, to speak: and the facility wherewith we see they lend us their voices, and render both them and their breath so supple and pliant, to be formed and confined within a certain number of letters and syllables, does evince that they have a reason within, which renders them so docile and willing to learn. Everybody, I believe, is glutted with the several sorts of tricks that tumblers teach their dogs; the dances, where they do not miss any one cadence of the sound they hear; the several various motions and leaps they make them perform by the command of a word. But I observe this effect with the greatest admiration, which nevertheless is very common, in the dogs that lead the blind, both in the country and in cities: I have taken notice how they stop at certain doors, where they are wont to receive alms; how they avoid the encounter of coaches and carts, even there where they have sufficient room to pass; I have seen them, by the trench of a town, forsake a plain and even path and take a worse, only to keep their masters further from the ditch;\u2014how could a man have made this dog understand that it was his office to look to his master's safely only, and to despise his own conveniency to serve him? And how had he the knowledge that a way was wide enough for him that was not so for a blind man? Can all this be apprehended without ratiocination!\n\nI must not omit what Plutarch says he saw of a dog at Rome with the Emperor Vespasian, the father, at the theatre of Marcellus. This dog served a player, that played a farce of several parts and personages, and had therein his part. He had, amongst other things, to counterfeit himself for some time dead, by reason of a certain drug he was supposed to eat After he had swallowed a piece of bread, which passed for the drug, he began after awhile to tremble and stagger, as if he was taken giddy: at last, stretching himself out stiff, as if dead, he suffered himself to be drawn and dragged from place to place, as it was his part to do; and afterward, when he knew it to be time, he began first gently to stir, as if awaking out of a profound sleep, and lifting up his head looked about him after such a manner as astonished all the spectators.\nThe oxen that served in the royal gardens of Susa, to water them, and turn certain great wheels to draw water for that purpose, to which buckets were fastened (such as there are many in Languedoc), being ordered every one to draw a hundred turns a day, they were so accustomed to this number that it was impossible by any force to make them draw one turn more; but, their task being performed, they would suddenly stop and stand still. We are almost men before we can count a hundred, and have lately discovered nations that have no knowledge of numbers at all.\n\nThere is more understanding required in the teaching of' others than in being taught. Now, setting aside what Democritus held and proved, \"That most of the arts we have were taught us by other animals,\" as by the spider to weave and sew; by the swallow to build; by the swan and nightingale music; and by several animals to make medicines:\u2014Aristotle is of opinion \"That the nightingales teach their young ones to sing, and spend a great deal of time and care in it;\" whence it happens that those we bring up in cages, and which have not had the time to learn of their parents, want much of the grace of their singing: we may judge by this that they improve by discipline and study; and, even amongst the wild, it is not all and every one alike\u2014every one has learnt to do better or worse, according to their capacity. And so jealous are they one of another, whilst learning, that they contention with emulation, and by so vigorous a contention that sometimes the vanquished fall dead upon the place, the breath rather failing than the voice. The younger ruminate pensively and begin to mutter some broken notes; the disciple listens to the master's lesson, and gives the best account he is able; they are silent oy turns; one may hear faults corrected and observe some reprehensions of the teacher. \" have formerly seen,\" says Arrian, \"an elephant having a cymbal hung at each leg, and another fastened to his trunk, at the sound of which all the others danced round about him, rising and bending at certain cadences, as they were guided by the instrument; and 'twas delightful to hear this harmony.\" In the spectacles of Rome there were ordinarily seen elephants taught to move and dance to the sound of the voice, dances wherein were several changes and cadences very hard to learn. And some have been known so intent upon their lesson as privately to practice it by themselves, that they might not be chidden nor beaten by their masters.\nBut this other story of the pie, of which we have Plutarch himself for a warrant, is very strange. She lived in a barber's shop at Rome, and did wonders in imitating with her voice whatever she heard. It happened one day that certain trumpeters stood a good while sounding before the shop. After that, and all the next day, the pie was pensive, dumb, and melancholic; which every body wondered at, and thought the noise of the trumpets had so stupified and astonished her that her voice was gone with her hearing. But they found at last that it was a profound meditation and a retiring into herself, her thoughts exercising and preparing her voice to imitate the sound of those trumpets, so that the first voice she uttered was perfectly to imitate their strains, stops, and changes; having by this new lesson quitted and taken in disdain all she had learned before.\n\nI will not omit this other example of a dog, also, which the same Plutarch (I am sadly confounding all order, but I do not propose arrangement here any more than elsewhere throughout my book) which Plutarch says he saw on board a ship. This dog being puzzled how to get the oil that was in the bottom of a jar, which he could not reach with his tongue by reason of the narrow mouth of the vessel, went and fetched stones and let them fall into the jar till he made the oil rise so high that he could reach it.\nWhat is this but an effect of a very subtle capacity! 'Tis said that the ravens of Barbary do the same, when the water they would drink is too low. This action is somewhat akin to what Juba, a king of their nation relates of the elephants: \"That when, by the craft of the hunter, one of them is trapped in certain deep pits prepared for them, and covered over with brush to deceive them, all the rest, in great diligence, bring a great many stones and logs of wood to raise the bottom so that he may get out.\" But this animal, in several other effects, comes so near to human capacity that, should I particularly relate all that experience hath delivered to us, I should easily have what I usually maintain granted: namely, that there is more difference betwixt such and such a man than betwixt such a beast and such a man. The keeper of an elephant in a private house of Syria robbed him every meal of the half of his allowance.\nOne day his master would himself feed him, and poured the full measure of barley he had ordered for his allowance into his manger which the elephant, casting an angry look at the keeper, with his trunk separated the one-half from the other, and thrust it aside, by that declaring the wrong was done him.\nAnd another, having a keeper that mixed stones with his corn to make up the measure, came to the pot where he was boiling meat for his own dinner, and filled it with ashes. These are particular effects: but that which all the world has seen, and all the world knows, that in all the armies of the Levant one of the greatest force consisted in elephants, with whom they did, without comparison, much greater execution than we now do with our artillery; which takes, pretty nearly, their place in a day of battle (as may easily be supposed by such as are well read in ancient history);\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \"The sires of these huge animals were wont\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Carthaginian Hannibal to mount;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our leaders also did these beasts bestride,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And mounted thus Pyrrhus his foes defied;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Nay, more, upon their backs they used to bear\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Castles with armed cohorts to the war.\"\nThey must necessarily have very confidently relied upon the fidelity and understanding of these beasts when they entrusted them with the vanguard of a battle, where the least stop they should have made, by reason of the bulk and heaviness of their bodies, and the least fright that should have made them face about upon their own people, had been enough to spoil all: and there are but few examples where it has happened that they have fallen foul upon their own troops, whereas we ourselves break into our own battalions and rout one another. They had the charge not of one simple movement only, but of many several things to be performed in the battle: as the Spaniards did to their dogs in their new conquest of the Indies, to whom they gave pay and allowed them a share in the spoil; and those animals showed as much dexterity and judgment in pursuing the victory and stopping the pursuit; in charging and retiring, as occasion required; and in distinguishing their friends from their enemies, as they did ardour and fierceness.\n\nWe more admire and value things that are unusual and strange than those of ordinary observation. I had not else so long insisted upon these examples: for I believe whoever shall strictly observe what we ordinarily see in those animals we have amongst us may there find as wonderful effects as those we seek in remote countries and ages. 'Tis one and the same nature that rolls on her course, and whoever has sufficiently considered the present state of things, might certainly conclude as to both the future ana the past. I have formerly seen men, brought hither by sea from very distant countries, whose language not being understood by us, and moreover their mien, countenance, and habit, being quite differing from ours; which of us did not repute them savages and brutes! Who did not attribute it to stupidity and want of common sense to see them mute, ignorant of the French tongue, ignorant of our salutations and cringes, our port and behaviour, from which all human nature must by all means take its pattern and example. All that seems strange to us, and that we do not understand, we condemn. The same thing happens also in the judgments we make of beasts. They have several conditions like to ours; from those we may, by comparison, draw some conjecture: but by those qualities that are particular to themselves, what know we what to make of them! The horses, dogs, oxen, sheep, birds, and most of the animals that live amongst us, know our voices, and suffer themselves to be governed by them: so did Crassus's lamprey, and came when he called it; as also do the eels that are found in the Lake Arethusa; and I have seen several ponds where the fishes come to eat at a certain call of those who use to feed them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They every one have names, and one and all\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Straightway appear at their own master's call:\"\nWe may judge of that. We may also say that the elephants have some participation of religion forasmuch as after several washings and purifications they are observed to lift up their trunk like arms, and, fixing their eyes towards the rising of the sun, continue long in meditation and contemplation, at certain hours of the days, of their own motion; without instruction or precept But because we do not see any such signs in other animals, we cannot for that conclude that they are without religion, nor make any judgment of what is concealed from us. As we discern something in this action which the philosopher Cleanthes took notice of, because it something resembles our own. He saw, he says, \"Ants go from their ant-hill, carrying the dead body of an ant towards another ant-hill, whence several other ants came out to meet them, as if to speak with them; where, after having been a while together, the last returned to consult, you may suppose, with their fellow-citizens, and so made two or three journeys, by reason of the difficulty of capitulation. In the conclusion, the last comers brought the first a worm out of their burrow, as it were for the ransom of the defunct, which the first laid upon their backs and carried home, leaving the dead body to the others.\" This was the interpretation that Cleanthes gave of this transaction, giving us by that to understand that those creatures that have no voice are not, nevertheless, without intercourse and mutual communication, whereof 'tis through our own defect that we do not participate; and for that reason foolishly take upon us to pass our censure. But they yet produce either effects far beyond our capacity, to which we are so far from being able to arrive by imitation that we cannot so much as by imitation conceive it. Many are of opinion that in the great and last naval engagement that Antony lost to Augustus, his admiral galley was stayed in the middle of her course by the little fish the Latins call remora, by reason of the property she has of staying all sorts of vessels to which she fastens herself. And the Emperor Caligula, sailing with a great navy upon the coast of Romania, his galley only was suddenly stayed by the same fish, which, he caused to be taken, fastened as it was to the keel of his ship, very angry that such a little animal could resist both the sea, the wind, and the force of all his oars, by being only fastened by the beak to his galley (for it is a shell-fish); and was moreover, not without great reason, astonished that, being brought to him in the vessel, it had no longer the strength it had without. A citizen of Cyzicus formerly acquired the reputation of a good mathematician for having learnt the quality of the hedge-hog: he has his burrow open in divers places, and to several winds, and, foreseeing the wind that is to come, stops the hole on that side, which that citizen observing, gave the city certain predictions of the wind which was presently to blow. The camlon takes her colour from the place upon which she is laid; but the polypus gives himself what colour he pleases, according to occasion, either to conceal himself from what he fears, or from what he has a design to seize: in the camlon 'tis a passive, but in the polypus 'tis an active, change. We have some changes of colour, as in fear, anger, shame, and other passions, that alter our complexions; but it is by the effect of suffering, as with the camlon. It is in the power of the jaundice, indeed, to make us turn yellow, but 'tis not in the power of our own will. Now these effects that we discover in other animals, much greater than ours, seem to imply some more excellent faculty in them unknown to us; as 'tis to be presumed there are several other qualities and abilities of theirs, of which no appearances have arrived at us.\n\nAmongst all the predictions of elder times, the most ancient and the most certain were those taken from the flight of birds; we have nothing certain like it, nor any thing to be so much admired. That rule and order of the moving of the wing, whence they derived the consequences of future things, must of necessity be guided by some excellent means to so noble an operation: for to attribute this great effect to any natural disposition, without the intelligence, consent, and meditation of him by whom it is produced, is an opinion evidently false. That it is so, the cramp-fish has this quality, not only to benumb all the members that touch her, but even through the nets transmit a heavy dulness into the hands of those that move and handle them; nay, it is further said that if one pour water upon her, he will feel this numbness mount up the water to the hand, and stupefy the feeling through the water. This is a miraculous force; but 'tis not useless to the cramp-fish; she knows it, and makes use on't; for, to catch the prey she desires, she will bury herself in the mud, that other fishes swimming over her, struck and benumbed with this coldness of hers, may fall into her power. Cranes, swallows, and other birds of passage, by shifting their abode according to the seasons, sufficiently manifest the knowledge they have of their divining faculty, and put it in use. Huntsmen assure us that to cull out from amongst a great many puppies that which ought to be preserved as the best, the best way is to refer the choice to the mother; as thus, take them and carry them out of the kennel, and the first she brings back will certainly be the best; or if you make a show as if you would environ the kennel with fire, that one she first catches up to save. By which it appears they have a sort of prognostic which we have not; or that they have some virtue in judging of their whelps other and more certain than we have.\n\nThe manner of coming into the world, of engendering, nourishing, acting, moving, living and dying of beasts, is so near to ours that whatever we retrench from their moving causes, and add to our own condition above theirs, can by no means proceed from any meditation of our own reason. For the regimen of our health, physicians propose to us the example of the beasts' manners and way of living; for this saying (out of Plutarch) has in all times been in the mouth of these people: \"Keep warm thy feet and head, as to the rest, live like a beast.\"\n\nThe chief of all natural actions is generation; we have a certain disposition of members which is the most proper for us to that end; nevertheless, we are ordered by Lucretius to conform to the gesture and posture of the brutes as the most effectual:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  More ferarum,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quadrupedumque magis ritu, plerumque putantur\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Concipere uxores:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Quia sic loca sumere possunt,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Pectoribus positis, sublatis semina lumbis;\nand the same authority condemns, as hurtful, those indiscreet and impudent motions which the women have added of their own invention, to whom it proposes the more temperate and modest pattern and practice of the beasts of their own sex:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Nam mulier prohibet se concipere atque rpugnt,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Clunibus ipsa viri Venerem si lta retractet,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Atque exossato ciet omni pectore fluctua.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Ejicit enim sulci recta regione viaque\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vomerem, atque locis avertit seminis ictum.\nIf it be justice to render to every one their due, the beasts that serve, love, and defend their benefactors, and that pursue and fall upon strangers and those who offend them, do in this represent a certain air of our justice; as also in observing a very equitable equality in the distribution of what they have to their young. And as to friendship, they have it without comparison more lively and constant than men have. King Lysimachus's dog, Hyrcanus, master being dead, lay on his bed, obstinately refusing either to eat or drink; and, the day that his body was burnt, he took a run and leaped into the fire, where he was consumed, As also did the dog of one Pyrrhus, for he would not stir from off his master's bed from the time he died; and when they carried him away let himself be carried with him, and at last leaped into the pile where they burnt his master's body. There are inclinations of affection which sometimes spring in us, without the consultation of reason; and by a fortuitous temerity, which others call sympathy; of which beasts are as capable as we. We see horses take such an acquaintance with one another that we have much ado to make them eat or travel, when separated; we observe them to fancy a particular colour in those of their own kind, and, where they meet it, run to it with great joy and demonstrations of good will, and have a dislike and hatred for some other colour. Animals have choice, as well as we, in their amours, and cull out their mistresses; neither are they exempt from our jealousies and implacable malice.\n\nDesires are either natural and necessary, as to eat and drink; or natural and not necessary, as the coupling with females; or neither natural nor necessary; of which last sort are almost all the desires of men; they are all superfluous and artificial. For 'tis marvellous how little will satisfy nature, how little she has left us to desire; our ragouts and kickshaws are not of her ordering. The Stoics say that a man may live on an olive a day. The delicacy of our wines is no part of her instruction, nor the refinements we introduce into the indulgence of our amorous appetites:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Neque ilia\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Magno prognatum deposcit consule cunnum.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \"Nature, in her pursuit of love, disclaims\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The pride of titles, and the pomp of names.\"\nThese irregular desires, that the ignorance of good and a false opinion have infused into us, are so many that they almost exclude all the natural; just as if there were so great a number of strangers in the city as to thrust out the natural inhabitants, or, usurping upon their ancient rights and privileges, should extinguish their authority and introduce new laws and customs of their own. Animals are much more regular than we, and keep themselves with greater moderation within the limits nature has prescribed; but yet not so exactly that they have not sometimes an analogy with our debauches. And as there have been furious desires that have impelled men to the love of beasts, so there have been examples of beasts that have fallen in love with us, and been seized with monstrous affection betwixt kinds; witness the elephant who was rival to Aristophanes the grammarian in the love of a young herb-wench in the city of Alexandria, who was nothing behind him in all the offices of a very passionate suitor; for going through the market where they sold fruit, he would take some in his trunk and carry them to her. He would as much as possible keep her always in his sight, and would sometimes put his trunk under her handkerchief into her bosom, to feel her breasts. They tell also of a dragon in love with a girl, and of a goose enamoured of a child; of a ram that was suitor to the minstrelless Glaucia, in the town of Asopus; and we see not unfrequently baboons furiously in love with women. We see also certain male animals that are fond of the males of their own kind. Oppian and others give us some examples of the reverence that beasts have to their kindred in their copulations; but experience often shows us the contrary:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Nec habetur turpe juvenc\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Ferre patrem tergo; fit equo sua filia conjux;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Quasque creavit, init pecudes caper; ipsaque cujus\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Semine concepta est, ex illo concipit ales.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"The heifer thinks it not a shame to take\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Her lusty sire upon her willing back:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The horse his daughter leaps, goats scruple not\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  T' increase the herd by those they have begot;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And birds of all sorts do in common live,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And by the seed they have conceived conceive.\"\nAnd for subtle cunning, can there be a more pregnant example than in the philosopher Thales's mule? who, fording a river, laden with salt, and by accident stumbling there, so that the sacks he carried were all wet, perceiving that by the melting of the salt his burden was something lighter, he never failed, so oft as he came to any river, to lie down with his load; till his master, discovering the knavery, ordered that he should be laden with wood? wherein, finding himself mistaken, he ceased to practise that device. There are several that very vividly represent the true image of our avarice; for we see them infinitely solicitus to get all they can, and hide it with that exceeding great care, though they never make any use of it at all. As to thrift, they surpass us not only in the foresight and laying up, and saving for the time to come, but they have, moreover, a great deal of the science necessary thereto. The ants bring abroad into the sun their grain and seed to air, refresh and dry them when they perceive them to mould and grow musty, lest they should decay and rot. But the caution and prevention they use in gnawing their grains of wheat surpass all imagination of human prudence; for by reason that the wheat does not always continue sound and dry, but grows soft, thaws and dissolves as if it were steeped in milk, whilst hasting to germination; for fear lest it should shoot and lose the nature and property of a magazine for their subsistence, they nibble off the end by which it should shoot and sprout.\n\nAs to what concerns war, which is the greatest and most magnificent of human actions, I would very fain know whether we would use it for an argument of some prerogative or, on contrary, for a testimony of our weakness and imperfection; as, in truth, the science of undoing and killing one another, and of ruining and destroying our own kind, has nothing in it so tempting as to make it be coveted by beasts who have it not.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Quando leoni Fortior eripuit vitam leo? quo nemore unquam\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Expiravit aper majoris dentibus apri?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \"No lion drinks a weaker lion's gore,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   No boar expires beneath a stronger boar.\"\nYet are they not universally exempt; witness the furious encounters of bees, and the enterprises of the princes of the contrary armies:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Spe duobus Regibus incessit magno discordia motu;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Continuoque animos vulgi et trepidantia bello\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Gorda licet long prsciscere.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \"But if contending factions arm the hive,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  When rival kings in doubtful battle strive,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Tumultuous crowds the dread event prepare,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And palpitating hearts that beat to war.\"\nI never read this divine description but that, methinks, I there see human folly and vanity represented in their true and lively colours.

Of fresh memory, the Portuguese having besieged the city of Tamly, in the territory of Xiatine, the inhabitants of the place brought a great many hives, of which are great plenty in that place, upon the wall; and with fire drove the bees so furiously upon the enemy that they gave over the enterprise, not being able to stand their attacks and endure their stings; and so the citizens, by this new sort of relief, gained liberty and the victory with so wonderful a fortune, that at the return of their defenders from the battle they found they had not lost so much as one. The souls of emperors and cobblers are cast in the same mould; the weight and importance of the actions of princes considered, we persuade ourselves that they must be produced by some as weighty and important causes; but we are deceived; for they are pushed on, and pulled back in their motions, by the same springs that we are in our little undertakings. The same reason that makes us wrangle with a neighbour causes a war betwixt princes; the same reason that makes us whip a lackey, falling into the hands of a king makes him ruin a whole province. They are as lightly moved as we, but they are able to do more. In a gnat and an elephant the passion is the same.\n\nAs to fidelity, there is no animal in the world so treacherous as man. Our histories have recorded the violent pursuits that dogs have made after the murderers of their masters. King Pyrrhus observing a dog that watched a dead man's body, and understanding that he had for three days together performed that office, commanded that the body should be buried, and took the dog along with him. One day, as he was at a general muster of his army, this dog, seeing his master's murderers, with great barking and extreme signs of anger flew upon them, and by this first accusation awakened the revenge of this murder, which was soon after perfected by form of justice. As much was done by the dog of the wise Hesiod, who convicted the sons of Ganictor of Naupactus of the murder committed on the person of his master. Another dog being to guard a temple at Athens, having spied a sacrilegious thief carrying away the finest jewels, fell to barking at him with all his force, but the warders not awaking at the noise, he followed him, and day being broke, kept off at a little distance, without losing sight of him; if he offered him any thing to eat he would not take it, but would wag his tail at all the passengers he met, and took whatever they gave him; and if the thief laid down to sleep, he likewise stayed upon the same place. The news of this dog being come to the warders of the temple they put themselves upon the pursuit, inquiring of the colour of the dog, and at last found him in the city of Cromyon, and the thief also, whom they brought back to Athens, where he got his reward; and the judges, in consideration of this good office, ordered a certain measure of corn for the dog's daily sustenance, at the public charge, and the priests to take care of it. Plutarch delivers this story for a certain truth, and that it happened in the age wherein he lived.\n\nAs to gratitude (for I think we need bring this word into a little repute), this one example, which Apion reports himself to have been an eye-witness of, shall suffice.\n\n\"One day,\" says he, \"at Rome, they entertained the people with the sight of the fighting of several strange beasts, and principally of lions of an unusual size; there was one amongst the rest who, by his furious deportment, by the strength and largeness of his limbs, and by his loud and dreadful roaring, attracted the eyes of all the spectators. Amongst other slaves that were presented to the people in this combat of beasts there was one Androdus, of Dacia, belonging to a Roman lord of consular dignity. This lion having seen him at a distance first made a sudden stop, as it were in a wondering posture, and then softly approached nearer in a gentle and peaceable manner, as if it were to enter into acquaintance with him. This being done, and being now assured of what he sought for, he began to wag his tail, as dogs do when they flatter their masters, and to kiss and lick the hands and thighs of the poor wretch, who was beside himself, and almost dead with fear. Androdus being by this kindness of the lion a little come to himself, and having taken so much heart as to consider and know him, it was a singular pleasure to see the joy and caresses that passed betwixt them. At which the people breaking into loud acclamations of joy, the emperor caused the slave to be called, to know from him the cause of so strange an event; who thereupon told him a new and a very strange story: \"My master,\" said he, \"being pro-consul in Africa, I was constrained, by his severity and cruel usage, being daily beaten, to steal from him and run away; and, to hide myself secretly from a person of so great authority in the province, I thought it my best way to fly to the solitudes, sands, and uninhabitable parts of that country, resolving that in case the means of supporting life should chance to fail me, to make some shift or other to kill myself. The sun being excessively hot at noon, and the heat intolerable, I lit upon a private and almost inaccessible cave, and went into it Soon after there came in to me this lion, with one foot wounded and bloody, complaining and groaning with the pain he endured. At his coming I was exceeding afraid; but he having spied me hid in the comer of his den, came gently to me, holding out and showing me his wounded foot, as if he demanded my assistance in his distress. I then drew out a great splinter he had got there, and, growing a little more familiar with him, squeezing the wound thrust out the matter, dirt, and gravel which was got into it, and wiped and cleansed it the best I could. He, finding himself something better, and much eased of his pain, laid him down to rest, and presently fell asleep with his foot in my hand. From that time forward he and I lived together in this cave three whole years upon one and the same diet; for of the beasts that he killed in hunting he always brought me the best pieces, which I roasted in the sun for want of fire, and so ate it. At last, growing weary of this wild and brutish life, the lion being one day gone abroad to hunt for our ordinary provision, I departed thence, and the third day after was taken by the soldiers, who brought me from Africa to this city to my master, who presently condemned me to die, and to be thus exposed to the wild beasts. Now, by what I see, this lion was also taken soon after, who has now sought to recompense me for the benefit and cure that he received at my hands.\" This is the story that Androdus told the emperor, which he also conveyed from hand to hand to the people; wherefore, at the general request, he was absolved from his sentence and set at liberty, and the lion was, by order of the people, presented to him. \"We afterwards saw,\" says Apion, \"Androdus leading this lion, in nothing but a small leash, from tavern to tavern at Rome, and receiving what money every body would give him, the lion being so gentle as to suffer himself to be covered with the flowers that the people threw upon him, every one that met him saying, 'There goes the lion that entertained the man; there goes the man that cured the lion.'\"\n\nWe often lament the loss of beasts we love, and so do they the loss of us:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Post, bellator equus, positis insignibus, thon\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It lacrymans, guttisque humectt grandibus ora.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \"To close the pomp, thon, the steed of state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Is led, the fun'ral of his lord to wait.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stripped of his trappings, with a sullen pace\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He walks, and the big tears run rolling down his face.\"\nAs some nations have their wives in common, and some others have every one his own, is not the same seen among beasts, and marriages better kept than ours? As to the society and confederation they make amongst themselves, to league together and to give one another mutual assistance, is it not known that oxen, hogs, and other animals, at the cry of any of their kind that we offend, all the herd run to his aid and embody for his defence? The fish Scarus, when he has swallowed the angler's hook, his fellows all crowd about him and gnaw the line in pieces; and if, by chance, one be got into the bow net, the others present him their tails on the outside, which he holding fast with his teeth, they after that manner disengage and draw him out.\n\nMullets, when one of their companions is engaged, cross the line over their back, and, with a fin they have there, indented like a saw, cut and saw it asunder. As to the particular offices that we receive from one another for the service of life, there are several like examples amongst them. 'Tis said that the whale never moves that she has not always before her a little fish like the sea-gudgeon, for this reason called the guide-fish, whom the whale follows, suffering himself to be led and turned with as great facility as the rudder guides the ship; in recompense of which service also, whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster's mouth, are immediately lost and swallowed up, this little fish retires into it in great security, and there sleeps, during which time the whale never stirs; but so soon as ever it goes out he immediately follows it; and if by accident he loses the sight of his little guide, he goes wandering here and there, and strikes his sides against the rocks like a ship that has lost her helm; which Plutarch affirms to have seen in the island of Anticyra. There is a like society betwixt the little bird called the wren and the crocodile. The wren serves for a sentinel over this great animal; and if the ichneumon, his mortal enemy, approach to fight him, this little bird, for fear lest he should surprise him asleep, both with his voice and bill rouses him and gives him notice of his danger.\nHe feeds of this monster's leavings, who receives him familiarly into his mouth, suffering him to peck in his jaws and betwixt his teeth, and thence to pick out the bits of flesh that remain; and when he has a mind to shut his mouth, he first gives the bird warning to go out by closing it by little and little, and without bruising or doing it any harm at all. The shell-fish called the naker, lives in the same intelligence with the shrimp, a little sort of animal of the lobster kind, which serves him in the nature of a porter, sitting at the opening of the shell, which the naker keeps always gaping and open till the shrimp sees some little fish, proper for their prey, within the hollow of the shell, where she enters too, and pinches the naker so to the quick that she is forced to close her shell, where they two together devour the prey they have trapped in their fort. In the manner of living of the tunnies we observe a singular knowledge of the three parts of mathematics. As to astrology, they teach it men, for they stay in the place where they are surprised by the brumal solstice, and never stir thence till the next equinox; for which reason Aristotle himself attributes to them this science. As to geometry and arithmetic, they always form their numbers in the figure of a cube, every way square, and make up the body of a battalion, solid, close, and environed round with six equal sides, and swim in this square order, as large behind as before; so that whoever in seeing them can count one rank may easily number the whole troop, by reason that the depth is equal to the breadth, and the breadth to the length.\n\nAs to magnanimity, it will be hard to exhibit a better instance of it than in the example of the great dog sent to Alexander the Great from the Indies. They first brought him a stag to encounter, next a boar, and after that a bear, all which he slighted, and disdained to stir from his place; but when he saw a lion he then immediately roused himself, evidently manifesting that he declared that alone worthy to enter the lists with him. Touching repentance and the acknowledgment of faults, 'tis reported of an elephant that, having in the impetuosity of his rage killed his keeper, he fell into so extreme a sorrow that he would never after eat, but starved himself to death. And as to clemency, 'tis said of a tiger, the most cruel of all beasts, that a kid having been put in to him, he suffered a two days' hunger rather than hurt it, and the third broke the grate he was shut up in, to seek elsewhere for prey; so unwilling he was to fall upon the kid, his familiar and his guest, And as to the laws of familiarity and agreement, formed by conversation, it ordinarily happens that we bring up cats, dogs, and hares, tame together.\n\nBut that which seamen by experience know, and particularly in the Sicilian Sea, of the quality of the halcyons, surpasses all human thought of what kind of animal has nature even so much honoured the birth? The poets indeed say that one only island, Delos, which was before a floating island, was fixed for the service of Latona's lying-in; but God has ordered that the whole ocean should be stayed, made stable and smooth, without waves, without winds or rain, whilst the halcyon produces her young, which is just about the solstice, the shortest day of the year; so that by her privilege we have seven days and seven nights in the very heart of winter wherein we may sail without danger. Their females never have to do with any other male but their own, whom they serve and assist all their lives, without ever forsaking him. If he becomes weak and broken with age, they take him upon their shoulders and carry him from place to place, and serve him till death. But the most inquisitive into the secrets of nature could never yet arrive at the knowledge of the wonderful fabric wherewith the halcyon builds her nest for her little ones, nor guess at the materials. Plutarch, who has seen and handled many of them, thinks it is the bones of some fish which she joins and binds together, interlacing them, some lengthwise and others across, and adding ribs and hoops in such manner that she forms at last a round vessel fit to launch; which being done, and the building finished, she carries it to the beach, where the sea beating gently against it shows where she is to mend what is not well jointed and knit, and where better to fortify the seams that are leaky, that open at the beating of the waves; and, on the contrary, what is well built and has had the due finishing, the beating of the waves does so close and bind together that it is not to be broken or cracked by blows either of stone or iron without very much ado. And that which is more to be admired is the proportion and figure of the cavity within, which is composed and proportioned after such a manner as not to receive or admit any other thing than the bird that built it; for to any thing else it is so impenetrable, close, and shut, nothing can enter, not so much as the water of the sea. This is a very dear description of this building, and borrowed from a very good hand; and yet me-thinks it does not give us sufficient light into the difficulty of this architecture. Now from what vanity can it proceed to despise and look down upon, and disdainfully to interpret, effects that we can neither imitate nor comprehend?\n\nTo pursue a little further this equality and correspondence betwixt us and beasts, the privilege our soul so much glorifies herself upon, of things she conceives to her own law, of striping all things that come to her of their mortal and corporeal qualities, of ordering and placing things she conceives worthy her taking notice of, stripping and divesting them of their corruptible qualities, and making them to lay aside length, breadth, depth, weight, colour, smell, roughness, smoothness, hardness, softness, and all sensible accidents, as mean and superfluous vestments, to accommodate them to her own immortal and spiritual condition; as Rome and Paris, for example, that I have in my fancy, Paris that I imagine, I imagine and comprehend it without greatness and without place, without stone, without plaster, and without wood; this very same privilege, I say, seems evidently to be in beasts; for a courser accustomed to trumpets, to musket-shots, and battles, whom we see start and tremble in his sleep and stretched upon his litter, as if he were in a fight; it is almost certain that he conceives in his soul the beat of a drum without noise, and an army without arms and without body:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Quippe videbis equos fortes, cum membra jacebunt\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In somnis, sudare tamen, spirareque spe,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Et quasi de palm summas contendere vires:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     \"You shall see maneg'd horses in their sleep\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Sweat, snort, start, tremble, and a clutter keep,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  As if with all their force they striving were\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   The victor's palm proudly away to bear:\"\nthe hare, that a greyhound imagines in his sleep, after which we see him pant so whilst he sleeps, stretch out his tail, shake his legs, and perfectly represents all the motions of a course, is a hare without fur and without bones:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Venantumque canes in molli spe quiete\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jactant crura tamen subito, vocesque repente\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mittunt, et crebras reducunt naribus auras,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Ut vestigia si teneant inventa ferarum:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expergeftique sequuntur inania spe\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cervorum simulacra, fag quasi dedita cernant;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Donee discussis redeant erroribus ad se:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"And hounds stir often in their quiet rest,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spending their mouths, as if upon a quest,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Snuff, and breathe quick and short, as if they went\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a full chase upon a burning scent:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nay, being wak'd, imagin'd stags pursue,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As if they had them in their real view,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till, having shook themselves more broad awake,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They do at last discover the mistake:\"\nthe watch-dogs, that we often observe to snarl in their dreams, and afterwards bark out, and start up as if they perceived some stranger at hand; the stranger that their soul discerns is a man spiritual and imperceptible, without dimension, without colour, and without being:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Consueta domi catulorum blanda propago\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Degere, spe levem ex oculis volucremque soporem\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Discutere, et corpus de terra corripere instant,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Proinde quasi ignotas facies atque ora tuantur.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \"The fawning whelps of household curs will rise,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, shaking the soft slumber from their eyes,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oft bark and stare at ev'ry one within,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As upon faces they had never seen.\"\nto the beauty of the body, before I proceed any further I should know whether or no we are agreed about the description. 'Tis likely we do not well know what beauty is in nature and in general, since to our own human beauty we give so many divers forms, of which, were there any natural rule and prescription, we should know it in common, as the heat of the fire. But we fancy the forms according to our own appetite and liking:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turpis Romano Belgicus ore color:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A German hue ill suits, a Roman face.\"\nThe Indians paint it black and tawny, with great swelled lips, wide flat noses and load the cartilage betwixt the nostrils with great rings of gold, to make it hang down to the mouth; as also the under lip with great hoops, enriched with precious stones, that weigh them down to fall upon the chin, it being with them a singular grace to show their teeth, even below the roots. In Peru the greatest ears are the most beautiful, which they stretch out as far as they can by art. And a man now living says that he has seen in an eastern nation this care of enlarging them in so great repute, and the ear loaded with so ponderous jewels, that he did with great ease put his arm, sleeve and all, through the hole of an ear. There are elsewhere nations that take great care to black their teeth, and hate to see them white, whilst others paint them red. The women are reputed more beautiful, not only in Biscay, but elsewhere, for having their heads shaved; and, which is more, in certain frozen countries, as Pliny reports. The Mexicans esteem a low forehead a great beauty, and though they shave all other parts, they nourish hair on the forehead and increase it by art, and have great breasts in so great reputation that they affect to give their children suck over their shoulders. We should paint deformity so. The Italians fashion it gross and massy; the Spaniards gaunt and slender; and amongst us one has it white, another brown; one soft and delicate, another strong and vigorous; one will have his mistress soft and gentle, others haughty and majestic. Just as the preference in beauty that Plato attributes to the spherical figure the Epicureans gave rather to the pyramidal or square, and cannot swallow a god in the form of a bowl. But, be it how it will, nature has no more privileged us in this from her common laws than in the rest And if we will judge ourselves aright, we shall find that, if there be some animals less favoured in this than we, there are others, and in greater number, that are more; a multis animalibus decore vincimur \"Many animals surpass us in beauty,\" even among the terrestrial, our compatriots; for as to those of sea, setting the figure aside, which cannot fall into any manner of proportion, being so much another thing in colour, clearness, smoothness, and arrangement, we sufficiently give place to them; and no less, in all qualities, to the aerial.

What animals have not their faces above and not before, and do not look opposite, as we do; and that do not in their natural posture discover as much of heaven and earth as man? And what qualities of our bodily constitution, in Plato and Cicero, may not indifferently serve a thousand sorts of beasts? Those that most resemble us are the most despicable and deformed of all the herd; for those, as to outward appearance and form of visage, are baboons:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simia quam similis, turpissima bestia, nobis?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"How like to man, in visage and in shape,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is, of all beasts the most uncouth, the ape?\"\nas to the internal and vital parts, the hog. In earnest, when I consider man stark naked, even in that sex which seems to have greatest share of beauty, his defects, natural subjection, and imperfections, I find that we have more reason than any other animal, to cover ourselves; and are to be excused from borrowing of those to whom nature has in this been kinder than to us, to trick ourselves out with their beauties, and hide ourselves under their spoils, their wool, feathers, hair, and silk. Let us observe, as to the rest, that man is the sole animal whose nudities offend his own companions, and the only one who in his natural actions withdraws and hides himself from his own kind. And really 'tis also an effect worth consideration, that they who are masters in the trade prescribe, as a remedy for amorous passions, the full and free view of the body a man desires; for that to cool the ardour there needs no more but freely and fully to see what he loves:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Ille quod obscnas in aperto corpore partes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Viderat, in cursu qui fuit, hsit amor.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The love that's tilting when those parts appear\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Open to view, flags in the hot career,\"\nAnd, although this receipt may peradventure proceed from a nice and cold humour, it is notwithstanding a very great sign of our deficiencies that use and acquaintance should make us disgust one another.

This discourse reflects upon none but the ordinary sort of women, and is not so sacrilegious as to comprehend those divine, supernatural, and extraordinary beauties, which we see shine occasionally among us like stars under a corporeal and terrestrial veil.\n\nAs to the rest, the very share that we allow to beasts of the bounty of nature, by our own confession, is very much to their advantage. We attribute to ourselves imaginary and fantastic good, future and absent good, for which human capacity cannot of herself be responsible; or good, that we falsely attribute to ourselves by the license of opinion, as reason, knowledge, and honour, and leave to them for their dividend, essential, durable, and palpable good, as peace, repose, security, innocence, and health; health, I say, the fairest and richest present that nature can make us. Insomuch that philosophy, even the Stoic, is so bold as to say, \"That Heraclitus and Pherecides, could they have trucked their wisdom for health, and have delivered themselves, the one of his dropsy, and the other of the lousy disease that tormented him, they had done well.\" By which they set a greater value upon wisdom, comparing and putting it into the balance with health, than they do with this other proposition, which is also theirs; they say that if Circe had presented Ulysses with the two potions, the one to make a fool become a wise man, and the other to make a wise man become a fool, that Ulysses ought rather to have chosen the last, than consent to that by which Circe changed his human figure into that of a beast; and say that wisdom itself would have spoke to him after this manner: \"Forsake me, let me alone, rather than lodge me under the body and figure of an ass.\" How! the philosophers, then will abandon this great and divine wisdom for this corporeal and terrestrial covering? It is then no more by reason, by discourse, and by the soul, that we excel beasts; 'tis by our beauty, our fair complexion, and our fine symmetry of parts, for which we must quit our intelligence, our prudence, and all the rest. Well, I accept this open and free confession; certainly they knew that those parts, upon which we so much value ourselves, are no other than vain fancy. If beasts then had all the virtue, knowledge, wisdom, and stoical perfection, they would still be beasts, and would not be comparable to man, miserable, wicked, mad, man. For, in short, whatever is not as we are is nothing worth; and God, to procure himself an esteem among us, must put himself into that shape, as we shall show anon. By which it appears that it is not upon any true ground of reason, but by a foolish pride and vain opinion, that we prefer ourselves before other animals, and separate ourselves from their society and condition.\n\nBut to return to what I was upon before; we have for our part inconstancy, irresolution, incertitude, sorrow, superstition, solicitude of things to come, even after we shall be no more, ambition, avarice, jealousy, envy, irregular, frantic, and untamed appetites, war, lying, disloyalty, detraction, and curiosity. Doubtless, we have strangely overpaid this fine reason, upon which we so much glorify ourselves, and this capacity of judging and knowing, if we have bought it at the price of this infinite number of passions to which we are eternally subject. Unless we shall also think fit, as even Socrates does, to add to the counterpoise that notable prerogative above beasts, That whereas nature has prescribed them certain seasons and limits for the delights of Venus, she has given us the reins at all hours and all seasons.\" Ut vinum ogrotis, quia prodest rar, nocet sopissime, melius est non adhibere omnino, quam, spe dubio salutis, in apertam per-niciem incurrere; sic, haud scio an melius fuerit humano generi motum istum celerem cogitationis, acumen, solertiam, quam rationem vocamus, quoniam pestifera sint multis, ad-modum paucis saluiaria, non dari omnino, quam tam muniice et tam large dari? As it falls out that wine often hurting the sick, and very rarely doing them good, it is better not to give them any at all than to run into an apparent danger out of hope of an uncertain benefit, so I know not whether it had not been better for mankind that this quick motion, this penetration, this subtlety that we call reason, had not been given to man at all; considering how pestiferous it is to many, and useful but to few, than to have been conferred in so abundant manner, and with so liberal a hand.\" Of what advantage can we conceive the knowledge of so many things was to Yarro and Aristotle? Did it exempt them from human inconveniences? Were they by it freed from the accidents that lay heavy upon the shoulders of a porter?\nDid they extract from their logic any consolation for the gout? Or, for knowing how this humour is lodged in the joints, did they feel it the less? Did they enter into composition with death by knowing that some nations rejoice at his approach; or with cuckoldry, by knowing that in some parts of the world wives are in common? On the contrary, having been reputed the greatest men for knowledge, the one amongst the Romans and the other amongst the Greeks, and in a time when learning did most flourish, we have not heard, nevertheless, that they had any particular excellence in their lives; nay, the Greek had enough to do to clear himself from some notable blemishes in his.

Learning, methinks, has its place amongst the necessary, things of life, as glory, nobility, dignity, or at the most, as beauty, riches, and such other qualities, which indeed are useful to it, but remotely, and more by opinion than by nature. We stand very little more in need of offices, rules, and laws of living in our society, than cranes and ants do in theirs; and yet we see that these carry themselves very regularly without erudition. If man was wise, he would take the true value of every thing according as it was useful and proper to his life. Whoever will number us by our actions and deportments will find many more excellent men amongst the ignorant than among the learned; aye, in all sorts of virtue. Old Rome seems to me to have been of much greater value, both for peace and war, than that learned Rome that ruined itself. And, though all the rest should be equal, yet integrity and innocency would remain to the ancients, for they cohabit singularly well with simplicity. But I will leave this discourse, that would lead me farther than I am willing to follow; and shall only say this further, 'tis only humility and submission that can make a complete good man. We are not to leave the knowledge of his duty to every man's own judgment; we are to prescribe it to him, and not suffer him to choose it at his own discretion; otherwise, according to the imbecility, and infinite variety of our reasons and opinions, we should at large forge ourselves duties that would, as Epicurus says, enjoin us to eat one another.\n\nThe first law that ever God gave to man was a law of pure obedience; it was a commandment naked and simple, wherein man had nothing to inquire after, nor to dispute; forasmuch as to obey is the proper office of a rational soul, acknowledging a heavenly superior and benefactor. From obedience and submission spring all other virtues, as all sin does from selfopinion. And, on the contrary, the first temptation that by the devil was offered to human nature, its first poison insinuated itself into us by the promise made us of knowledge and wisdom; Eritis sicut Dii, scientes bonum et malum. \"Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\" And the sirens, in Homer, to allure Ulysses, and draw him within the danger of their snares, offered to give him knowledge. The plague of man is the opinion of wisdom; and for this reason it is that ignorance is so recommended to us, by our religion, as proper to faith and obedience; Cavete ne quis vos decipiat per philosophiam et inanes seductiones, secundum elementa mundi. \"Take heed, lest any man deceive you by philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, and the rudiments of the world.\" There is in this a general consent amongst all sorts of philosophers, that the sovereign good consists in the tranquillity of the soul and body; but where shall we find it?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ad summum, sapiens uno minor est Jove, dives,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex deniqne regum;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Prcipue sanus, nisi cum pituita molesta est:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     \"In short, the wise is only less than Jove,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Rich, free, and handsome; nay, a king above\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  All earthly kings; with health supremely blest,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Excepting when a cold disturbs his rest!\"\nIt seems, in truth, that nature, for the consolation of our miserable and wretched state, has only given us presumption for our inheritance. 'Tis as Epictetus says, that man has nothing properly his own, but the use of his opinion; we have nothing but wind and smoke for our portion. The gods have health in essence, says philosophy, and sickness in intelligence. Man, on the contrary, possesses his goods by fancy, his ills in essence. We have reason to magnify the power of our imagination; for all our goods are only in dream. Hear this poor calamitous animal huff! \"There is nothing,\" says Cicero, \"so charming as the employment of letters; of letters, I say, by means whereof the infinity of things, the immense grandeur of nature, the heavens even in this world, the earth, and the seas are discovered to us; 'tis they that have taught us religion, moderation, and the grandeur of courage, and that have rescued our souls from darkness, to make her see all things, high, low, first, last, and middling; 'tis they that furnish us wherewith to live happily and well, and conduct us to pass over our lives without displeasure, and without offence.\" Does not this man seem to speak of the condition of the ever-living and almighty God? But as to effects, a thousand little countrywomen have lived lives more equal, more sweet, and constant than his.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Deus ille fuit, deus, inclyte Memmi,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Qui princeps vit rationem invenit earn, qu\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Nunc appellatur sapientia; quique per artem\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Fluctibus  tantis vitam, tantisque tenebris,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In tam tranquilla et tam clara luce locavit:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"That god, great Memmus, was a god no doubt\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who, prince of life, first found that reason out\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now wisdom called; and by his art, who did\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That life in tempests tost, and darkness hid,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Place in so great a calm, and clear a light:\"\nhere are brave ranting words; but a very slight accident put this man's understanding in a worse condition than that of the meanest shepherd, notwithstanding this instructing god, this divine wisdom. Of the same stamp and impudence is the promise of Democritus's book: \"I am going to speak of all things;\" and that foolish title that Aristotle prefixes to one of his, order only afforded him a few lucid intervals which he employed in composing his book, and at last made him kill himself,\u2014Eusebius's Chronicon.\n\nOf the Mortal Gods; and the judgment of Chrysippus, that \"Dion was as virtuous as God;\" and my Seneca himself says, that \"God had given him life; but that to live well was his own;\" conformably to this other: In virtute vere gloriamur; quod non contingeret, si id donum Deo, non nobis haberemus: \"We truly glory in our virtue; which would not be, if it was given us of God, and not by ourselves;\" this is also Seneca's saying; \"that the wise man hath fortitude equal with God, but that his is in spite of human frailty, wherein therefore he more than equals God.\" There is nothing so ordinary as to meet with sallies of the like temerity; there is none of us, who take so much offence to see himself equalled with God, as he does to see himself undervalued by being ranked with other creatures; so much more are we jealous of our own interest than that of our Creator.\n\nBut we must trample under foot this foolish vanity, and briskly and boldly shake the ridiculous foundation upon which these false opinions are founded. So long as man shall believe he has any means and power of himself, he will never acknowledge what he owes to his Maker; his eggs shall always be chickens, as the saying is; we must therefore strip him to his shirt. Let us see some notable examples of the effects of his philosophy: Posidonius being tormented with a disease so painful as made him writhe his arms and gnash his teeth, thought he sufficiently scorned the dolour, by crying out against it: \"Thou mayst do thy worst, I will not confess that thou art an evil.\" He was as sensible of the pain as my footman, but he made a bravado of bridling his tongue, at least, and restraining it within the laws of his sect: Re succumbere non oportebat, verbis gloriantem. \"It did not become him, that spoke so big, to confess his frailty when he came to the test.\" Arcesilas being ill of the gout, and Car-neades, who had come to see him, going away troubled at his condition, he called him back, and showing him his feet and breast: \"There is nothing comes thence hither,\" said he. This has something a better grace, for he feels himself in pain, and would be disengaged from it; but his heart, notwithstanding, is not conquered nor subdued by it. The other stands more obstinately to his point, but, I fear, rather verbally than really. And Dionysius Heracleotes, afflicted with a vehement smarting in his eyes, was reduced to quit these stoical resolutions. But even though knowledge should, in effect, do as they say, and could blunt the point, and dull the edge, of the misfortunes that attend us, what does she, more than what ignorance does more purely and evidently?\u2014The philosopher Pyrrho, being at sea in very great danger, by reason of a mighty storm, presented nothing to the imitation of those who were with him, in that extremity, but a hog they had on board, that was fearless and unconcerned at the tempest. Philosophy, when she has said all she can, refers us at last to the example of a gladiator, wrestler, or muleteer, in which sort of people we commonly observe much less apprehension of death, sense of pain, and other inconveniences, and more of endurance, than ever knowledge furnished any one withal, that was not bom and bred to hardship. What is the cause that we make incisions, and cut the tender limbs of an infant, and those of a horse, more easily than our own\u2014but ignorance only? How many has mere force of imagination made sick? We often see men cause themselves to be let blood, purged, and physicked, to be cured of diseases they only feel in opinion.\u2014When real infirmities fail us, knowledge lends us her's; that colour, that complexion, portend some catarrhous defluxion; this hot season threatens us with a fever; this breach in the life-line of your left hand gives you notice of some near and dangerous indisposition; and at last she roundly attacks health itself; saying, this sprightliness and vigour of youth cannot continue in this posture; there must be blood taken, and the heat abated, lest it turn against yourself. Compare the life of a man subjected to such imaginations, to that of a labourer that suffers himself to be led by his natural appetite, measuring things only by the present sense, without knowledge, and without prognostic, that feels no pain or sickness, but when he is really ill. Whereas the other has the stone in his soul, before he has it in his bladder; as if it were not time enough to suffer the evil when it shall come, he must anticipate it by fancy, and run to meet it.\n\nWhat I say of physic may generally serve in example for all other sciences. Thence is derived that ancient opinion of the philosophers that placed the sovereign good in the discovery of the weakness of our judgment My ignorance affords me as much occasion of hope as of fear; and having no other rule for my health than that of the examples of others, and of events I see elsewhere upon the like occasion, I find of all sorts, and rely upon those which by comparison are most favourable to me. I receive health with open arms, free, full, and entire, and by so much the more whet my appetite to enjoy it, by how much it is at present less ordinary and more rare; so far am I from troubling its repose and sweetness with the bitterness of a new and constrained manner of living. Beasts sufficiently show us how much the agitation of our minds brings infirmities and diseases upon us. That which is told us of those of Brazil, that they never die but of old age, is attributed to the serenity and tranquillity of the air they live in; but I rather attribute it to the serenity and tranquillity of their souls, free from all passion, thought, or employment, extended or unpleasing, a people that pass over their lives in a wonderful simplicity and ignorance, without letters, without law, without king, or any manner of religion. And whence comes that, which we find by experience, that the heaviest and dullest men are most able; and the most to be desired in amorous performances; and that the love of a muleteer often renders itself more acceptable than that of a gentleman, if it be not that the agitation of the soul in the latter disturbs his physical ability, dissolves and tires it, as it also ordinarily troubles and tires itself. What puts the soul beside itself, and more usually throws it into madness, but her own promptness, vigour, and agility, and, finally, her own proper force? Of what is the most subtle folly made, but of the most subtle wisdom? As great friendships spring from great enmities, and vigorous health from mortal diseases, so from the rare and vivid agitations of our souls proceed the most wonderful and most distracted frenzies; 'tis but half a turn of the toe from the one to the other. In the actions of madmen we see how infinitely madness resembles the most vigorous operations of the soul. Who does not know how indiscernible the difference is betwixt folly and the sprightly elevations of a free soul, and the effects of a supreme and extraordinary virtue? Plato says that melancholy persons are the most capable of discipline, and the most excellent; and accordingly in none is there so great a propension to madness. Great wits are ruined by their own proper force and pliability; into what a condition, through his own agitation and promptness of fancy, is one of the most judicious, ingenious, and nearest formed, of any other Italian poet, to the air of the ancient and true poesy, lately fallen! Has he not vast obligation to this vivacity that has destroyed him? to this light that has blinded him? to this exact and subtle apprehension of reason that has put him beside his own? to this curious and laborious search after sciences, that has reduced him to imbecility? and to this rare aptitude to the exercises of the soul, that has rendered him without exercise and without soul? I was more angry, if possible, than compassionate, to see him at Ferrara in so pitiful a condition surviving himself, forgetting both himself and his works, which, without his knowledge, though before his face, have been published unformed and incorrect.\n\nWould you have a man healthy, would you have him regular, and in a steady and secure posture? Muffle him up in the shades of stupidity and sloth. We must be made beasts to be made wise, and hoodwinked before we are fit to be led. And if one shall tell me that the advantage of having a cold and dull sense of pain and other evils, brings this disadvantage along with it, to render us consequently less sensible also in the fruition of good and pleasure, this is true; but the misery of our condition is such that we have not so much to enjoy as to avoid, and that the extremest pleasure does not affect us to the degree that a light grief does: Segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt.

Which is the reason why that sect of philosophers, which sets the greatest value upon pleasure, has yet fixed it chiefly in unconsciousness of pain. To be freed from ill is the greatest good that man can hope for or desire; as Ennius says,\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Nimium boni est, cui nihil est mali;\nfor that every tickling and sting which are in certain pleasures, and that seem to raise us above simple health and passiveness, that active, moving, and, I know not how, itching, and biting pleasure; even that very pleasure itself aims at nothing but insensibility as its mark. The appetite that carries us headlong to women's embraces has no other end but only to cure the torment of our ardent and furious desires, and only requires to be glutted and laid at rest, and delivered from the fever. And so of the rest. I say, then, that if simplicity conducts us to a state free from evil, she leads us to a very happy one according to our condition. And yet we are not to imagine it so stupid an insensibility as to be totally without sense; for Crantor had very good reason to controvert the insensibility of Epicurus, if founded so deep that the very first attack and birth of evils were not to be perceived: \"I do not approve such an insensibility as is neither possible nor to be desired. I am very well content not to be sick; but if I am, I would know that I am so; and if a caustic be applied, or incisions made in any part, I would feel them.\" In truth, whoever would take away the knowledge and sense of evil, would at the same time eradicate the sense of pleasure, and finally annihilate man himself: Istud nihil dolere, non sine magn mercede contingit, immanitatis in animo, stuporis in corpore. \"An insensibility that is not to be purchased but at the price of inhumanity in the soul, and of stupidity of the body.\" Evil appertains to man of course. Neither is pain always to be avoided, nor pleasure always pursued.\n\n'Tis a great advantage to the honour of ignorance that knowledge itself throws us into its arms, when she finds herself puzzled to fortify us against the weight of evil; she is constrained to come to this composition, to give us the reins, and permit us to fly into the lap of the other, and to shelter ourselves under her protection from the strokes and injuries of fortune. For what else is her meaning when she instructs us to divert our thoughts from the ills that press upon us, and entertain them with the meditation of pleasures past and gone; to comfort ourselves in present afflictions with the remembrance of fled delights, and to call to our succour a vanished satisfaction, to oppose it to the discomfort that lies heavy upon us? Levationes gritudinum in avocatione a cogitand molesti, et revocation ad contemplandas voluptates, ponit; \"He directs us to alleviate our grief and pains by rejecting unpleasant thoughts, and recalling agreeable ideas;\" if it be not that where her power fails she would supply it with policy, and make use of sleight of hand where force of limbs will not serve her turn? For not only to a philosopher, but to any man in his right wits, when he has upon him the thirst of a burning fever, what satisfaction can it be to him to remember the pleasure he took in drinking Greek wine a month ago? It would rather only make matters worse to him:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Che ricordarsi il ben doppia la noia.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"The thinking of pleasure doubles trouble.\"\nOf the same stamp is this other counsel that philosophy gives, only to remember the happiness that is past, and to forget the misadventures we have undergone; as if we had the science of oblivion in our own power, and counsel, wherein we are yet no more to seek.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Suavis laborum est prteritorum rmoria.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"Sweet is the memory of by-gone pain.\"\nHow does philosophy, that should arm me to contend with fortune, and steel my courage to trample all human adversities under foot, arrive to this degree of cowardice to make me hide my head at this rate, and save myself by these pitiful and ridiculous shifts? For the memory represents to us not what we choose, but what she pleases; nay, there is nothing that so much imprints any thing in our memory as a desire to forget it. And 'tis a good way to retain and keep any thing safe in the soul to solicit her to lose it. And this is false: Est situm in nobis, ut et adversa quasi perpetua oblivione obruamus, et secunda jucunde et suaviter meminerimus; \"it is in our power to bury, as it were, in a perpetual oblivion, all adverse accidents, and to retain a pleasant and delightful memory of our successes;\" and this is true: Memini etiam quo nolo; oblivisci non possum quo volo. \"I do also remember what I would not; but I cannot forget what I would.\" And whose counsel is this?

He ran to find death, since he could not overtake knowledge. These are the words of the law upon the subject: \"If peradventure some great inconvenience happen, for which there is no remedy, the haven is near, and a man may save himself by swimming out of his body as out of a leaky skiff; for 'tis the fear of dying, and not the love of life, that ties the fool to his body.\"\n\nAs life renders itself by simplicity more pleasant, so more innocent and better, also it renders it as I was saying before: \"The simple and ignorant,\" says St. Paul, \"raise themselves up to heaven and take possession of it; and we, with all our knowledge, plunge ourselves into the infernal abyss.\" I am neither swayed by Valentinian, a professed enemy to all learning and letters, nor by Licinius, both Roman emperors, who called them the poison and pest of all political government; nor by Mahomet, who, as 'tis said, interdicted all manner of learning to his followers; but the example of the great Lycurgus, and his authority, with the reverence of the divine Lacedemonian policy, so great, so admirable, and so long flourishing in virtue and happiness, without any institution or practice of letters, ought certainly to be of very great weight. Such as return from the new world discovered by the Spaniards in our fathers' days, testify to us how much more honestly and regularly those nations live, without magistrate and without law, than ours do, where there are more officers and lawyers than there are of other sorts of men and business:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Di cittatorie piene, e di libelli,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  D'esamine, e di carte di procure,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Hanno le mani e il seno, e gran fastelli\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Di chioge, di consigli, et di letture:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Per cui le faculta de* poverelli\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Non sono mai nelle citt sicure;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Hanno dietro e dinanzi, e d'ambi i lati,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Notai, procuratori, ed avvocati.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0      \"Their bags were full of writs, and of citations,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Of process, and of actions and arrests,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Of bills, of answers, and of replications,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   In courts of delegates, and of requests,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   To grieve the simple sort with great vexations;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   They had resorting to them as their guests,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Attending on their circuit, and their journeys,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Scriv'ners, and clerks, and lawyers, and attorneys.\"\nIt was what a Roman senator of the latter ages said, that their predecessors' breath stunk of garlic, but their stomachs were perfumed with a good conscience; and that, on the contrary, those of his time were all sweet odour without, but stunk within of all sorts of vices; that is to say, as I interpret it, that they abounded with learning and eloquence, but were very defective in moral honesty. Incivility, ignorance, simplicity, roughness, are the natural companions of innocence; curiosity, subtlety, knowledge, bring malice in their train; humility, fear, obedience, and affability, which are the principal things that support and maintain human society, require an empty and docile soul, and little presuming upon itself.\n\nChristians have a particular knowledge, how natural and original an evil curiosity is in man; the thirst of knowledge, and the desire to become more wise, was the first ruin of man, and the way by which he precipitated himself into eternal damnation. Pride was his ruin and corruption. 'Tis pride that diverts him from the common path, and makes him embrace novelties, and rather choose to be head of a troop, lost and wandering in the path of error; to be a master and a teacher of lies, than to be a disciple in the school of truth, suffering himself to be led and guided by the hand of another, in the right and beaten road. 'Tis, peradventure, the meaning of this old Greek saying, that superstition follows pride, and obeys it as if it were a father: [\u2014Greek\u2014] Ah, presumption, how much dost thou hinder us?\n\nAfter that Socrates was told that the god of wisdom had assigned to him the title of sage, he was astonished at it, and, searching and examining himself throughout, could find no foundation for this divine judgment. He knew others as just, temperate, valiant, and learned, as himself; and more eloquent, more handsome, and more profitable to their country than he. At last he concluded that he was not distinguished from others, nor wise, but only because he did not think himself so; and that his God considered the opinion of knowledge and wisdom as a singular absurdity in man; and that his best doctrine was the doctrine of ignorance, and simplicity his best wisdom. The sacred word declares those miserable among us who have an opinion of themselves: \"Dust and ashes,\" says it to such, \"what hast thou wherein to glorify thyself?\" And, in another place, \"God has made man like unto a shadow,\" of whom who can judge, when by removing the light it shall be vanished! Man is a thing of nothing.\n\nOur force is so far from being able to comprehend the divine height, that, of the works of our Creator, those best bear his mark, and are with better title his, which we the least understand. To meet with an incredible thing is an occasion to Christians to believe; and it is so much the more according to reason, by how much it is against human reason. If it were according to reason, it would be no more a miracle; and if it were according to example, it would be no longer a singular thing. Melius scitur Deus nesdendo: \"God is better known by not knowing him,\" says St. Austin: and Tacitus, Sanctius est ac reverentius de actis Deorum credere, quam scire; \"it is more holy and reverent to believe the works of God than to know them;\" and Plato thinks there is something of impiety in inquiring too curiously into God, the world, and the first causes of things: Atque illum quidem parentem hujus universitaiis invenire, difficile; et, quum jam inveneris, indicare in vulgtis, nefas: \"to find out the parent of the world is very difficult; and when found out, to reveal him to the vulgar is sin,\" says Cicero. We talk indeed of power, truth, justice; which are words that signify some great thing; but that thing we neither see nor conceive at all. We say that God fears, that God is angry, that God loves,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Immortalia mortali sermone notantes:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Giving to things immortal mortal names.\"\nThese are all agitations and emotions that cannot be in God, according to our form, nor can we imagine them, according to his. It only belongs to God to know himself, and to interpret his own works; and he does it in our language, going out of himself, to stoop to us who grovel upon the earth. How can prudence, which is the choice between good and evil, be properly attributed to him whom no evil can touch? How can reason and intelligence, which we make use of, to arrive by obscure at apparent things; seeing that nothing is obscure to him? How justice, which distributes to every one what appertains to him, a thing begot by the society and community of men, how is that in God? How temperance, which is the moderation of corporal pleasures, that have no place in the Divinity? Fortitude to support pain, labour, and dangers, as little appertains to him as the rest; these three things have no access to him. For which reason Aristotle holds him equally exempt from virtue and vice: Neque gratia, neque ira teneri potest; quod quo talia essent, imbecilla essent omnia? \"He can neither be affected with favour nor indignation, because both these are the effects of frailty.\"\n\nThe participation we have in the knowledge of truth, such as it is, is not acquired by our own force: God has sufficiently given us to understand that, by the witnesses he has chosen out of the common people, simple and ignorant men, that he has been pleased to employ to instruct us in his admirable secrets. Our faith is not of our own acquiring; 'tis purely the gift of another's bounty: 'tis not by meditation, or by virtue of our own understanding, that we have acquired our religion, but by foreign authority and command wherein the imbecility of our own judgment does more assist us than any force of it; and our blindness more than our clearness of sight: 'tis more by__ the mediation of our ignorance than of our knowledge that we know any thing of the divine wisdom. 'Tis no wonder if our natural and earthly parts cannot conceive that supernatural and heavenly knowledge: let us bring nothing of our own, but obedience and subjection; for, as it is written, \"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.\"\n\nFinally, should I examine whether it be in the power of man to find out that which he seeks and if that quest, wherein he has busied himself so many ages, has enriched him with any new force, or any solid truth; I believe he will confess, if he speaks from his conscience, that all he has got by so long inquiry is only to have learned to know his own weakness. We have only by a long study confirmed and verified the natural ignorance we were in before. The same has fallen out to men truly wise, which befalls the ears of corn; they shoot and raise their heads high and pert, whilst empty; but when full and swelled with grain in maturity, begin to flag and droop. So men, having tried and sounded all things, and having found in that mass of knowledge, and provision of so many various things, nothing solid and firm, and nothing but vanity, have quitted their presumption, and acknowledged their natural condition. 'Tis what Velleius reproaches Cotta withal and Cicero, \"that they had learned of Philo, that they had learned nothing.\" Pherecydes, one of the seven sages, writing to Thales upon his death-bed; \"I have,\" said he, \"given order to my people, after my interment, to carry my writings to thee. If they please thee and the other sages, publish; if not, suppress them. They contain no certainty with which I myself am satisfied. Neither do I pretend to know the truth, or to attain to it. I rather open than discover things.\" The wisest man that ever was, being asked what he knew, made answer, \"He knew this, that he knew nothing.\" By which he verified what has been said, that the greatest part of what we know is the least of what we do not; that is to say, that even what we think we know is but a piece, and a very little one, of our ignorance. We know things in dreams, says Plato, and are ignorant of them in truth. Ormes pene veteres nihil cognosci, nihil percipi, nihil sciri posse dixerunt; angustos sensus, imbecilles animos, brevia curricula vito. \"Almost all the ancients have declared that there is nothing to be known, nothing to be perceived or understood; the senses are too limited, men's minds too weak, and the course of life too short.\" And of Cicero himself, who stood indebted to his learning for all he was worth, Valerius says, \"That he began to disrelish letters in his old age; and when at his studies, it was with great independency upon any one party; following what he thought probable, now in one sect, and then in another, evermore wavering under the doubts of the academy.\" Dicendum est, sed ita ut nihil affirment, quceram omnia, dubitans plerumque, et mihi diffidens. \"Something I must say, but so as to affirm nothing; I inquire into all things, but for the most part in doubt and distrust of myself.\"\n\nI should have too fair a game should I consider man in his common way of living and in gross; yet I might do it by his own rule, who judges truth not by weight, but by the number of votes. Let us set the people aside,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Qui vigilans stertit,....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Mortua cui vita est prope jam vivo atque videnti;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"Half of his life by lazy sleep's possess'd,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And when awake his soul but nods at best;\"\nwho neither feel nor judge, and let most of their natural faculties lie idle; I will take man in his highest ground. Let us consider him in that little number of men, excellent and culled out from the rest, who, having been endowed with a remarkable and particular natural force, have moreover hardened and whetted it by care, study, and art, and raised it to the highest pitch of wisdom to which it can possibly arrive. They have adjusted their souls to all ways and all biases; have propped and supported them with all foreign helps proper for them, and enriched and adorned them with all they could borrow for their advantage, both within and without the world; 'tis in these is placed the utmost and most supreme height to which human nature can attain. They have regulated the world with policies and laws. They have instructed it with arts and sciences, and by the example of their admirable manners. I shall make account of none but such men as these, their testimony and experience. Let us examine how far they have proceeded, and where they stopped. The errors and defects that we shall find amongst these men the world may boldly avow as their own.\n\nWhoever goes in search of any thing must come to this, either to say that he has found it, or that it is not to be found, or that he is yet upon the search. All philosophy is divided into these three kinds; her design is to seek out truth, knowledge, and certainty. The Peripatetics, Epicureans, Stoics, and others, have thought they have found it. These established the sciences we have, and have treated of them as of certain knowledge. Clitomachus, Carneades, and the Academics, have despaired in their search, and concluded that truth could not be conceived by our understandings. The result of these is weakness and human ignorance. This sect has had the most and the most noble followers. Pyrrho, and other skeptics or epechists, whose dogmas are held by many of the ancients to be taken from Homer, the seven sages, and from Archilochus and Euripides, and to whose number these are added, Zeno, Democritus, and Xenophanes, say that they are yet upon the inquiry after truth. These conclude that the others, who think they have found it out, are infinitely deceived; and that it is too daring a vanity in the second sort to determine that human reason is not able to attain unto it; for this establishing a standard of our power, to know and judge the difficulty of things, is a great and extreme knowledge, of which they doubt whether man is capable:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Nil sciri quisquis putat, id quoque nescit,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  An sciri possit; quam se nil scire fatetur.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"He that says nothing can be known, o'erthrows\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  His own opinion, for he nothing knows,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So knows not that.\"\nThe ignorance that knows itself, judges and condemns itself, is not an absolute ignorance; to be such, it must be ignorant of itself; so that the profession of the Pyrrhonians is to waver, doubt, and inquire, not to make themselves sure of, or responsible to themselves for any thing. Of the three actions of the soul, imaginative, appetitive, and consentive, they receive the two first; the last they kept ambiguous, without inclination or approbation, either of one thing or another, so light as it is. Zeno represented the motion of his imagination upon these divisions of the faculties of the soul thus: \"An open and expanded hand signified appearance; a hand half shut, and the fingers a little bending, consent; a clenched fist, comprehension; when with the left he yet thrust the right fist closer, knowledge.\" Now this situation of their judgment upright and inflexible, receiving all objects without application or consent, leads them to their ataraxy, which is a peaceable condition of life, temperate, and exempt from the agitations we receive by the impression of opinion and knowledge that we think we have of things; whence spring fear, avarice, envy, immoderate desires, ambition, pride, superstition, love of novelty, rebellion, disobedience, obstinacy, and the greatest part of bodily ills; nay, and by that they are exempt from the jealousy of their discipline; for they debate after a very gentle manner; they fear no requital in their disputes; when they affirm that heavy things descend they would be sorry to be believed, and love tobe contradicted, to engender doubt and suspense of judgment, which is their end. They only put forward their propositions to contend with those they think we have in our belief. If you take their arguments, they will as readily maintain the contrary; 'tis all one to them, they have no choice. If you maintain that snow is black, they will argue on the contrary that it is white; if you say it is neither the one nor the other, they will maintain that it is both. If you hold, of certain judgment, that you know nothing, they will maintain that you do. Yea, and if by an affirmative axiom you assure them that you doubt, they will argue against you that you doubt not; or that you cannot judge and determine that you doubt. And by this extremity of doubt, which jostles itself, they separate and divide themselves from many opinions, even of those they have several ways maintained, both concerning doubt and ignorance. \"Why shall not they be allowed to doubt,\" say they, \"as well as the dogmatists, one of whom says green, another yellow? Can any thing be proposed to us to grant, or deny, which it shall not be permitted to consider as ambiguous?\" And where others are carried away, either by the custom of their country, or by the instruction of parents, or by accident, as by a tempest, without judgment and without choice, nay, and for the most part before the age of discretion, to such and such an opinion, to the sect whether Stoic or Epicurean, with which they are prepossessed, enslaved, and fast bound, as to a thing they cannot forsake: Ad quamcumque disciplinant, velut tempestate, delati, ad earn, tanquam ad saxum, adhorescunt; \"every one cleaves to the doctrine he has happened upon, as to a rock against which he has been thrown by tempest;\" why shall not these likewise be permitted to maintain their liberty, and consider things without obligation or slavery? hoc liberiores et solutiores, quod integra illis est judicandi potestas: \"in this more unconstrained and free, because they have the greater power of judging.\" Is it not of some advantage to be disengaged from the necessity that curbs others? Is it not better to remain in suspense than to entangle one's self in the innumerable errors that human fancy has produced? Is it not much better to suspend one's persuasion than to intermeddle with these wrangling and seditious divisions: \"What shall I choose?\" \"What you please, provided you will choose.\" A very foolish answer; but such a one, nevertheless, as all dogmatism seems to point at, and by which we are not permitted to be ignorant of what we are ignorant of.\n\nTake the most eminent side, that of the greatest reputation; it will never be so sure that you shall not be forced to attack and contend with a hundred and a hundred adversaries to defend it. Is it not better to keep out of this hurly-burly? You are permitted to embrace Aristotle's opinions of the immortality of the soul with as much zeal as your honour and life, and to give the lie to Plato thereupon, and shall they be interdicted to doubt him? If it be lawful for Pantius to maintain his opinion about augury, dreams, oracles, vaticinations, of which the Stoics made no doubt at all; why may not a wise man dare to do the same in all things that he dared to do in those he had learned of his masters, established by the common consent of the school, whereof he is a professor and a member? If it be a child that judges, he knows not what it is; if a wise man, he is prepossessed. They have reserved for themselves a marvellous advantage in battle, having eased themselves of the care of defence. If you strike them, they care not, provided they strike too, and they turn every thing to their own use. If they overcome, your argument is lame; if you, theirs; if they fall short, they verify ignorance; if you fall short, you do it; if they prove that nothing is known, 'tis well; if they cannot prove it, 'tis also well: Ut quurn in eadem re paria contrariis in partibus momenta inveniuntur, facilius ab utraque parte assertio sustineatur: \"That when like sentiments happen pro and con in the same thing, the assent may on both sides be more easily suspended.\" And they make account to find out, with much greater facility, why a thing is false, than why 'tis true; that which is not, than that which is; and what they do not believe, than what they do. Their way of speaking is: \"I assert nothing; it is no more so than so, or than neither one nor t'other; I understand it not. Appearances are everywhere equal; the law of speaking, pro or con, is the same. Nothing seems true, that may not seem false.\" Their sacramental word is that is to say, \"I hold, I stir not.\" This is the burden of their song, and others of like stuff. The effect of which is a pure, entire, perfect, and absolute suspension of judgment. They make use of their reason to inquire and debate, but not to fix and determine. Whoever shall imagine a perpetual confession of ignorance, a judgment without bias, propension, or inclination, upon any occasion whatever, conceives a true idea of Pyrrhonism. I express this fancy as well as I can, by reason that many find it hard to conceive, and the authors themselves represent it a little variously and obscurely.\n\nAs to what concerns the actions of life, they are in this of the common fashion. They yield and give up themselves to their natural inclinations, to the power and impulse of passions, to the constitution of laws and customs, and to the tradition of arts; Non enim nos Deus ista scire, sed tantummodo uti, voluit. \"For God would not have us know, but only use those things.\" They suffer their ordinary actions to be guided by those things, without any dispute or judgment. For which reason I cannot consent to what is said of Pyrrho, by those who represent him heavy and immovable, leading a kind of savage and unsociable life, standing the jostle of carts, going upon the edge of precipices, and refusing to accommodate himself to the laws. This is to enhance upon his discipline; he would never make himself a stock or a stone, he would show himself a living man, discoursing, reasoning, enjoying all reasonable conveniences and pleasures, employing and making use of all his corporal and spiritual faculties in rule and reason. The fantastic, imaginary, and false privileges that man had usurped of lording it, ordaining, and establishing, he has utterly quitted and renounced. Yet there is no sect but is constrained to permit her sage to follow several things not comprehended, perceived, or consented to, if he means to live. And if he goes to sea, he follows that design, not knowing whether his voyage shall be successful or no; and only insists upon the tightness of the vessel, the experience of the pilot, and the convenience of the season, and such probable circumstances; after which he is bound to go, and suffer himself to be governed by appearances, provided there be no express and manifest contrariety in them. He has a body, he has a soul; the senses push them, the mind spurs them on. And although he does not find in himself this proper and singular sign of judging, and that he perceives that he ought not to engage his consent, considering that there may be some false, equal to these true appearances, yet does he not, for all that, fail of carrying on the offices of his life with great liberty and convenience. How many arts are there that profess to consist more in conjecture than knowledge; that decide not on true and false, and only follow that which seems so! There are, say they, true and false, and we have in us wherewith to seek it; but not to make it stay when we touch it. We are much more prudent, in letting ourselves be regulated by the order of the world, without inquiry. A soul clear from prejudice has a marvellous advance towards tranquillity and repose. Men that judge and control their judges, do never duly submit to them.\n\nHow much more docile and easy to be governed, both by the laws of religion and civil polity, are simple and incurious minds, than those over-vigilant wits, that will still be prating of divine and human causes! There is nothing in human invention that carries so great a show of likelihood and utility as this; this presents man, naked and empty, confessing his natural weakness, fit to receive some foreign force from above, unfurnished of human, and therefore more apt to receive into him the divine knowledge, making nought of his own judgment, to give more room to faith; neither disbelieving nor establishing any dogma against common observances; humble, obedient, disciplinable, and studious; a sworn enemy of heresy; and consequently freeing himself from vain and irreligious opinions, introduced by false sects. 'Tis a blank paper prepared to receive such forms from the finger of God as he shall please to write upon it. The more we resign and commit ourselves to God, and the more we renounce ourselves, of the greater value we are. \"Take in good part,\" says Ecclesiastes, \"the things that present themselves to thee, as they seem and taste from hand to mouth; the rest is out of thy knowledge.\" Dominus novit cogitationes hominum, quoniam van sunt: \"The Lord knoweth the hearts of men, that they are but vanity.\"\n\nThus we see that of the three general sects of philosophy, two make open profession of doubt and ignorance; and in that of the Dogmatists, which is the third, it is easy to discover that the greatest part of them only assume this face of confidence and assurance that they may produce the better effect; they have not so much thought to establish any certainty for us, as to show us how far they have proceeded in their search of truth: Quam docti jingunt magis quam nrunt: \"Which the learned rather feign than know.\" Timus, being to instruct Socrates in what he knew of the gods, the world, and men, proposes to speak to him as a man to a man; and that it is sufficient, if his reasons are probable as those of another; for that exact reasons were neither in his nor any other mortal hand; which one of his followers has thus imitated: Ut potero, explicabo: nec tamen, ut Pythius Apollo, certa ut sint et fixa qu dixero; sed, ut homunculus, probabilia conjectur sequens: \"I will, as well as I am able, explain; affirming, yet not as the Pythian oracle, that what I say is fixed and certain, but like a mere man, that follows probabilities by conjecture.\" And this, upon the natural and common subject of the contempt of death; he has elsewhere translated from the very words of Plato: Si forte, de Deorum natur ortuque mundi disserentes, minus id quod habemiis in animo consequi-mur, haud erit mirum; oquum est enim meminisse, et me, qui disseram, hominem esse, et vos, qui judicetis, ut, si probabilia dicentur, nihil ultra requiratis? \"If perchance, when we discourse of the nature of God, and the world's original, we cannot do it as we desire, it will be no great wonder. For it is just you should remember that both I who speak and you who are to judge, are men; so that if probable things are delivered, you shall require and expect no more.\" Aristotle ordinarily heaps up a great number of other men's opinions and beliefs, to compare them with his own, and to let us see how much he has gone beyond them, and how much nearer he approaches to the likelihood of truth; for truth is not to be judged by the authority and testimony of others; which made Epicurus religiously avoid quoting them in his writings. This is the prince of all dogmatists, and yet we are told by him that the more we know the more we have room for doubt. In earnest, we sometimes see him shroud and muffle up himself in so thick and so inextricable an obscurity that we know not what to make of his advice; it is, in effect, a Pyrrhonism under a resolutive form. Hear Cicero's protestation, who expounds to us another's fancy by his own: Qui requirunt quid de quque re ipsi sentiamus, curiosius id faciunt quam necesse est,... Hoc in philosophi ratio, contra omnia disserendi, nuttamque rem aperte judicandi, profecta a Socrate, repetita ab Arcesila, conjirmata a Gameade, usqu ad nostram viget cetatem..........Hi sumus, qui omnibus veris falsa quodam adjuncta esse dicamus, tanta similitudine, ut in iis nulla insit certe judicandi et assentiendi nota. \"They who desire to know what we think of every thing are therein more inquisitive than is necessary. This practice in philosophy of disputing against every thing, and of absolutely concluding nothing, begun by Socrates, repeated by Arcesilaus, and confirmed by Cameades, has continued in use even to our own times. We are they who declare that there is so great a mixture of things false amongst all that are true, and they so resemble one another, that there can be in them no certain mark to direct us either to judge or assent.\" Why hath not Aristotle only, but most of the philosophers, affected difficulty, if not to set a greater value upon the vanity of the subject, and amuse the curiosity of our minds by giving them this hollow and fleshless bone to pick? Clitomachus affirmed \"That he could never discover by Carneades's writings what opinion he was of.\" This was it that made Epicurus affect to be abstruse, and that procured Heraclitus the epithet of [\u2014Greek\u2014] Difficulty is a coin the learned make use of, like jugglers, to conceal the vanity of their art, and which human sottishness easily takes for current pay.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Claras, ob obscuram linguam, magis inter manes...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Omnia enim stolidi magis admirantur amantque\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inversis qu sub verbis latitantia cemunt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"Bombast and riddle best do puppies please,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For fools admire and love such things as these;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And a dull quibble, wrapt in dubious phrase,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Up to the height doth their wise wonder raise.\"\nCicero reprehends some of his friends for giving more of their time to the study of astrology, logic, and geometry, than they were really worth; saying that they were by these diverted from the duties of life, and more profitable and proper studies. The Cyrenaick philosophers, in like manner, despised physics and logic. Zeno, in the very beginning of the books of the commonwealth, declared all the liberal arts of no use. Chrysippus said \"That what Plato and Aristotle had writ, concerning logic, they had only done in sport, and by way of exercise;\" and could not believe that they spoke in earnest of so vain a thing. Plutarch says the same of metaphysics. And Epicurus would have said as much of rhetoric, grammar, poetry, mathematics, and, natural philosophy excepted, of all the sciences; and Socrates of them all, excepting that which treats of manners and of life. Whatever any one required to be instructed in, by him, he would ever, in the first place, demand an account of the conditions of his life present and past, which he examined and judged, esteeming all other learning subsequent to that and supernumerary: Parum mihi placeant e littero quo ad virtutem doctoribus nihil pro-fuerunt. \"That learning is in small repute with me which nothing profited the teachers themselves to virtue.\" Most of the arts have been in like manner decried by the same knowledge; but they did not consider that it was from the purpose to exercise their wits in those very matters wherein there was no solid advantage.\n\nAs to the rest, some have looked upon Plato as a dogmatist, others as a doubter, others in some things the one, and in other things the other. Socrates, the conductor of his dialogues, is eternally upon questions and stirring up disputes, never determining, never satisfying, and professes to have no other science but that of opposing himself. Homer, their author, has equally laid the foundations of all the sects of philosophy, to show how indifferent it was which way we should choose. 'Tis said that ten several sects sprung from Plato; yet, in my opinion, never did any instruction halt and stumble, if his does not.\n\nSocrates said that midwives, in taking upon them the trade of helping others to bring forth, left the trade of bringing forth themselves; and that by the title of a wise man or sage, which the gods had conferred upon him, he was disabled, in his virile and mental love, of the faculty of bringing forth, contenting himself to help and assist those that could; to open their nature, anoint the passes, and facilitate their birth; to judge of the infant, baptize, nourish, fortify, swath, and circumcise it, exercising and employing his understanding in the perils and fortunes of others.\n\nIt is so with the most part of this third sort of authors, as the ancients have observed in the writings of Anaxagoras, Democritus, Parmenides, Xenophanes, and others. They have a way of writing, doubtful in substance and design, rather inquiring than teaching, though they mix their style with some dogmatical periods. Is not the same thing seen in Seneca and Plutarch? How many contradictions are there to be found if a man pry narrowly into them! So many that the reconciling lawyers ought first to reconcile them every one to themselves. Plato seems to have affected this method of philosophizing in dialogues; to the end that he might with greater decency, from several mouths, deliver the diversity and variety of his own fancies. It is as well to treat variously of things as to treat of them conformably, and better, that is to say, more copiously and with greater profit. Let us take example from ourselves: judgments are the utmost point of all dogmatical and determinative speaking; and yet those arrets that our parliaments give the people, the most exemplary of them, and those most proper to nourish in them the reverence due to that dignity, principally through the sufficiency of the persons acting, derive their beauty not so much from the conclusion, which with them is quotidian and common to every judge, as from the dispute and heat of divers and contrary arguments that the matter of law and equity will permit And the largest field for reprehension that some philosophers have against others is drawn from the diversities and contradictions wherein every one of them finds himself perplexed, either on purpose to show the vacillation of the human mind concerning every thing, or ignorantly compelled by the volubility and incomprehensibility of all matter; which is the meaning of the maxim\u2014\"In a slippery and sliding place let us suspend our belief;\" for, as Euripides says,\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"God's various works perplex the thoughts of men.\"\nLike that which Empedocles, as if transported with a divine fury, and compelled by truth, often strewed here and there in his writings: \"No, no, we feel nothing, we see nothing; all things are concealed from us; there is not one thing of which we can positively say what it is;\" according to the divine saying: Cogitationes mortalium timid, et incert adinventiones nostro et providentice. \"For the thoughts of mortal men are doubtful; and our devices are but uncertain.\" It is not to be thought strange if men, despairing to overtake what they hunt after, have not however lost the pleasure of the chase; study being of itself so pleasant an employment; and so pleasant that amongst the pleasures, the Stoics forbid that also which proceeds from the exercise of the mind, will have it curbed, and find a kind of intemperance in too much knowledge.\n\nDemocritus having eaten figs at his table that tasted of honey, fell presently to considering with himself whence they should derive this unusual sweetness; and to be satisfied in it, was about to rise from the table to see the place whence the figs had been gathered; which his maid observing, and having understood the cause, smilingly told him that \"he need not trouble himself about that, for she had put them into a vessel in which there had been honey.\" He was vexed at this discovery, and that she had deprived him of the occasion of this inquiry, and robbed his curiosity of matter to work upon: \"Go thy way,\" said he, \"thou hast done me an injury; but, for all that, I will seek out the cause as if it were natural;\" and would willingly have found out some true reason for a false and imaginary effect. This story of a famous and great philosopher very clearly represents to us that studious passion that puts us upon the pursuit of things, of the acquisition of which we despair. Plutarch gives a like example of some one who would not be satisfied in that whereof he was in doubt, that he might not lose the pleasure of inquiring into it; like the other who would not that his physician should allay the thirst of his fever, that he might not lose the pleasure of quenching it by drinking. Satius est supervacua discere, quam nihil. \"'Tis better to learn more than necessary than nothing at all.\" As in all sorts of feeding, the pleasure of eating is very often single and alone, and that what we take, which is acceptable to the palate, is not always nourishing or wholesome; so that which our minds extract from science does not cease to be pleasant, though there be nothing in it either nutritive or healthful. Thus they say: \"The consideration of nature is a diet proper for our minds, it raises and elevates us, makes us disdain low and terrestrial things, by comparing them with those that are celestial and high. The mere inquisition into great and occult things is very pleasant, even to those who acquire no other benefit than the reverence and fear of judging it.\" This is what they profess. The vain image of this sickly curiosity is yet more manifest in this other example which they so often urge. \"Eudoxus wished and begged of the gods that he might once see the sun near at hand, to comprehend the form, greatness, and beauty of it; even though he should thereby be immediately burned.\" He would at the price of his life purchase a knowledge, of which the use and possession should at the same time be taken from him; and for this sudden and vanishing knowledge lose all the other knowledge he had in present, or might afterwards have acquired.\n\nI cannot easily persuade myself that Epicurus, Plato, and Pytagoras, have given us their atom, idea and numbers, for current pay. They were too wise to establish their articles of faith upon things so disputable and uncertain. But in that obscurity and ignorance in which the world then was, every one of these great men endeavoured to present some kind of image or reflection of light, and worked their brains for inventions that might have a pleasant and subtle appearance; provided that, though false, they might make good their ground against those that would oppose them. Unicuique ista pro ingenio finguntur, non ex scienti vi. \"These things every one fancies according to his wit, and not by any power of knowledge.\"\n\nOne of the ancients, who was reproached, \"That he professed philosophy, of which he nevertheless in his own judgment made no great account,\" made answer, \"That this was truly to philosophize.\"\n\nThey wished to consider all, to balance every thing, and found that an employment well suited to our natural curiosity. Some things they wrote for the benefit of public society, as their religions; and for that consideration it was but reasonable that they should not examine public opinions to the quick, that they might not disturb the common obedience to the laws and customs of their country.\n\nPlato treats of this mystery with a raillery manifest enough; for where he writes according to his own method he gives no certain rule. When he plays the legislator he borrows a magisterial and positive style, and boldly there foists in his most fantastic inventions, as fit to persuade the vulgar, as impossible to be believed by himself; knowing very well how fit we are to receive all sorts of impressions, especially the most immoderate and preposterous; and yet, in his Laws, he takes singular care that nothing be sung in public but poetry, of which the fiction and fabulous relations tend to some advantageous end; it being so easy to imprint all sorts of phantasms in human minds, that it were injustice not to feed them rather with profitable untruths than with untruths that are unprofitable and hurtful. He says very roundly, in his Republic, \"That it is often necessary, for the benefit of men, to deceive them.\" It is very easy to distinguish that some of the sects have more followed truth, and the others utility, by which the last have gained their reputation. 'Tis the misery of our condition that often that which presents itself to our imagination for the truest does not appear the most useful to life. The boldest sects, as the Epicurean, Pyrrhonian, and the new Academic, are yet constrained to submit to the civil law at the end of the account.\n\nThere are other subjects that they have tumbled and tossed about, some to the right and others to the left, every one endeavouring, right or wrong, to give them some kind of colour; for, having found nothing so abstruse that they would not venture to speak of, they are very often forced to forge weak and ridiculous conjectures; not that they themselves looked upon them as any foundation, or establishing any certain truth, but merely for exercise. Non tam id sensisse quod dicerent, quam exercere ingnia materio difficultate videntur voluisse. \"They seem not so much themselves to have believed what they said, as to have had a mind to exercise their wits in the difficulty of the matter.\" And if we did not take it thus, how should we palliate so great inconstancy, variety, and vanity of opinions, as we see have been produced by those excellent and admirable men? As, for example, what can be more vain than to imagine, to guess at God, by our analogies and conjectures? To direct and govern him and the world by our capacities and our laws? And to serve ourselves, at the expense of the divinity, with what small portion of capacity he has been pleased to impart to our natural condition; and because we cannot extend our sight to his glorious throne, to have brought him down to our corruption and our miseries?\n\nOf all human and ancient opinions concerning religion, that seems to me the most likely and most excusable, that acknowledged God as an incomprehensible power, the original and preserver of all things, all goodness, all perfection, receiving and taking in good part the honour and reverence that man paid him, under what method, name, or ceremonies soever\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jupiter omnipotens, rerum, regumque, demque,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Progenitor, genitrixque.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"Jove, the almighty, author of all things,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The father, mother, of both gods and kings.\"\nThis zeal has universally been looked upon from heaven with a gracious eye. All governments have reaped fruit from their devotion; impious men and actions have everywhere had suitable events. Pagan histories acknowledge dignity, order, justice, prodigies, and oracles, employed for their profit and instruction in their fabulous religions; God, through his mercy, vouchsafing, by these temporal benefits, to cherish the tender principles of a kind of brutish knowledge that natural reason gave them of him, through the deceiving images of their dreams. Not only deceiving and false, but impious also and injurious, are those that man has forged from his own invention: and of all the religions that St. Paul found in repute at Athens, that which they had dedicated \"to the unknown God\" seemed to him the most to be excused.\n\nPythagoras shadowed the truth a little more closely, judging that the knowledge of this first cause and being of beings ought to be indefinite, without limitation, without declaration; that it was nothing else than the extreme effort of our imagination towards perfection, every one amplifying the idea according to the talent of his capacity. But if Numa attempted to conform the devotion of his people to this project; to attach them to a religion purely mental, without any prefixed object and material mixture, he undertook a thing of no use; the human mind could never support itself floating in such an infinity of inform thoughts; there is required some certain image to be presented according to its own model. The divine majesty has thus, in some sort, suffered himself to be circumscribed in corporal limits for our advantage. His supernatural and celestial sacraments have signs of our earthly condition; his adoration is by sensible offices and words; for 'tis man that believes and prays. I shall omit the other arguments upon this subject; but a man would have much ado to make me believe that the sight of our crucifixes, that the picture of our Saviour's passion, that the ornaments and ceremonious motions of our churches, that the voices accommodated to the devotion of our thoughts, and that emotion of the senses, do not warm the souls of the people with a religious passion of very advantageous effect.\n\nOf those to whom they have given a body, as necessity required in that universal blindness, I should, I fancy, most incline to those who adored the sun:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 La Lumire commune,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 L'oil du monde; et si Dieu au chef porte des yeux,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Les rayons du soleil sont ses yeulx radieux,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Qui donnent vie  touts, nous maintiennent et gardent,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Et les faictsdes humains en ce monde regardent:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ce beau, ce grand soleil qui nous faict les saisons,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Selon qu'il entre ou sort de ses douze maisons;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Qui remplit l'univers de ses vertus cognues;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Qui d'un traict de ses yeulx nous dissipe les nues;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  L'esprit, l'ame du monde, ardent et flamboyant,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  En la course d'un jour tout le Ciel tournoyant;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Plein d'immense grandeur, rond, vagabond, et ferme;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Lequel tient dessoubs luy tout le monde pour terme:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 En repos, sans repos; oysif, et sans sjour;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fils aisn de nature, et le pre du jour:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"The common light that equal shines on all,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Diffused around the whole terrestrial ball;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And, if the almighty Ruler of the skies\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Has eyes, the sunbeams are his radiant eyes,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  That life and safety give to young and old,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And all men's actions upon earth behold.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  This great, this beautiful, the glorious sun,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Who makes their course the varied seasons run;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That with his virtues fills the universe,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And with one glance can sullen clouds disperse;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Earth's life and soul, that, flaming in his sphere,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Surrounds the heavens in one day's career;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Immensely great, moving yet firm and round,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who the whole world below has made his bound;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At rest, without rest, idle without stay,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nature's first son, and father of the day:\"\nforasmuch as, beside this grandeur and beauty of his, 'tis the only piece of this machine that we discover at the remotest distance from us; and by that means so little known that they were pardonable for entering into so great admiration and reverence of it.\n\nThales, who first inquired into this sort of matter, believed God to be a Spirit that made all things of water; Anaximander, that the gods were always dying and entering into life again; and that there were an infinite number of worlds; Anaximines, that the air was God, that he was procreate and immense, always moving. Anaxagoras the first, was of opinion that the description and manner of all things were conducted by the power and reason of an infinite spirit. Alcmon gave divinity to the sun, moon, and stars, and to the soul. Pythagoras made God a spirit, spread over the nature of all things, whence our souls are extracted; Parmenides, a circle surrounding the heaven, and supporting the world by the ardour of light. Empedocles pronounced the four elements, of which all things are composed, to be gods; Protagoras had nothing to say, whether they were or were not, or what they were; Democritus was one while of opinion that the images and their circuitions were gods; another while, the nature that darts out those images; and then, our science and intelligence. Plato divides his belief into several opinions; he says, in his Timus, that the Father of the World cannot be named; in his Laws, that men are not to inquire into his being; and elsewhere, in the very same books, he makes the world, the heavens, the stars, the earth, and our souls, gods; admitting, moreover, those which have been received by ancient institution in every republic.\n\nXenophon reports a like perplexity in Socrates's doctrine; one while that men are not to inquire into the form of God, and presently makes him maintain that the sun is God, and the soul God; that there is but one God, and then that there are many. Speusippus, the nephew of Plato, makes God a certain power governing all things, and that he has a soul. Aristotle one while says it is the spirit, and another the world; one while he gives the world another master, and another while makes God the heat of heaven. Zenocrates makes eight, five named amongst the planets; the sixth composed of all the fixed stars, as of so many members; the seventh and eighth, the sun and moon. Heraclides Ponticus does nothing but float in his opinion, and finally deprives God of sense, and makes him shift from one form to another, and at last says that it is heaven and earth. Theophrastus wanders in the same irresolution amongst his fancies, attributing the superintendency of the world one while to the understanding, another while to heaven, and then to the stars. Strato says that 'tis nature, she having the power of generation, augmentation, and diminution, without form and sentiment Zeno says 'tis the law of nature, commanding good and prohibiting evil; which law is an animal; and takes away the accustomed gods, Jupiter, Juno, and Vesta. Diogenes Apolloniates, that 'tis air. Zenophanes makes God round, seeing and hearing, not breathing, and having nothing in common with human nature. Aristo thinks the form of God to be incomprehensible, deprives him of sense, and knows not whether he be an animal or something else; Cleanthes, one while supposes it to be reason, another while the world, another the soul of nature, and then the supreme heat rolling about, and environing all. Perseus, Zeno's disciple, was of opinion that men have given the title of gods to such as have been useful, and have added any notable advantage to human life, and even to profitable things themselves. Chrysippus made a confused heap of all the preceding theories, and reckons, amongst a thousand forms of gods that he makes, the men also that have been deified. Diagoras and Theodoras flatly denied that there were any gods at all. Epicurus makes the gods shining, transparent, and perflable, lodged as betwixt two forts, betwixt two worlds, secure from blows, clothed in a human figure, and with such members as we have; which members are to them of no use:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ego Deum genus esse semper duxi, et dicam colitum;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sed eos non curare opinor quid agat humanum genus.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I ever thought that gods above there were,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But do not think they care what men do here.\"\n\nTrust to your philosophy, my masters; and brag that you have found the bean in the cake when you see what a rattle is here with so many philosophical heads! The perplexity of so many worldly forms has gained this over me, that manners and opinions contrary to mine do not so much displease as instruct me; nor so much make me proud as they humble me, in comparing them. And all other choice than what comes from the express and immediate hand of God seems to me a choice of very little privilege. The policies of the world are no less opposite upon this subject than the schools, by which we may understand that fortune itself is not more variable and inconstant, nor more blind and inconsiderate, than our reason. The things that are most unknown are most proper to be deified; wherefore to make gods of ourselves, as the ancients did, exceeds the extremest weakness of understanding. I would much rather have gone along with those who adored the serpent, the dog, or the ox; forasmuch as their nature and being is less known to us, and that we have more room to imagine what we please of those beasts, and to attribute to them extraordinary faculties. But to have made gods of our own condition, of whom we ought to know the imperfections; and to have attributed to them desire, anger, revenge, marriages, generation, alliances, love, jealousy, our members and bones, our fevers and pleasures, our death and obsequies; this must needs have proceeded from a marvellous inebriety of the human understanding;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Qu procul usque adeo divino ab numine distant,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inque Dem numro qu sint indigna videri;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"From divine natures these so distant are,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They are unworthy of that character.\"\nFormo, otates, vestitus, omatus noti sunt; genera, conjugia, cognationes, omniaque traducta ad similitudinem imbellitar tis humano: nam et perturbatis animis inducuntur; accipimus enim deorurn cupiditates, cegritudines, iracundias; \"Their forms, ages, clothes, and ornaments are known: their descents, marriages, and kindred, and all adapted to the similitude of human weakness; for they are represented to us with anxious minds, and we read of the lusts, sickness, and anger of the gods;\" as having attributed divinity not only to faith, virtue, honour, concord, liberty, victory, and piety; but also to voluptuousness, fraud, death, envy, old age, misery; to fear, fever, ill fortune, and other injuries of our frail and transitory life:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quid juvat hoc, templis nostros inducere mores?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O curv in terris anim et colestium inanes!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"O earth-born souls! by earth-born passions led,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To every spark of heav'nly influence dead!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Think ye that what man values will inspire\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In minds celestial the same base desire?\"\nThe Egyptians, with an impudent prudence, interdicted, upon pain of hanging, that any one should say that their gods, Serapis and Isis, had formerly been men; and yet no one was ignorant that they had been such; and their effigies, represented with the finger upon the mouth, signified, says Varro, that mysterious decree to their priests, to conceal their mortal original, as it must by necessary consequence cancel all the veneration paid to them. Seeing that man so much desired to equal himself to God, he had done better, says Cicero, to have attracted those divine conditions to himself, and drawn them down hither below, than to send his corruption and misery up on high; but, to take it right, he has several ways done both the one and the other, with like vanity of opinion.\n\nWhen philosophers search narrowly into the hierarchy of their gods, and make a great bustle about distinguishing their alliances, offices, and power, I cannot believe they speak as they think.

And yet some amongst us are fallen into the like error, promising to themselves after the resurrection a terrestrial and temporal life, accompanied with all sorts of worldly conveniences and pleasures. Can we believe that Plato, he who had such heavenly conceptions, and was so well acquainted with the Divinity as thence to derive the name of the Divine Plato, ever thought that the poor creature, man, had any thing in him applicable to that incomprehensible power? and that he believed that the weak holds we are able to take were capable, or the force of our understanding sufficient, to participate of beatitude or eternal pains? We should then tell him from human reason: \"If the pleasures thou dost promise us in the other life are of the same kind that I have enjoyed here below, this has nothing in common with infinity; though all my five natural senses should be even loaded with pleasure, and my soul full of all the contentment it could hope or desire, we know what all this amounts to, all this would be nothing; if there be any thing of mine there, there is nothing divine; if this be no more than what may belong to our present condition, it cannot be of any value. All contentment of mortals is mortal. Even the knowledge of our parents, children, and friends, if that can affect and delight us in the other world, if that still continues a satisfaction to us there, we still remain in earthly and finite conveniences. We cannot as we ought conceive the greatness of these high and divine promises, if we could in any sort conceive them; to have a worthy imagination of them we must imagine them unimaginable, inexplicable, and incomprehensible, and absolutely another thing than those of our miserable experience.\" \"Eye hath not seen,\" saith St. Paul, \"nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man, the things that God hath prepared for them that love him.\" And if, to render us capable, our being were reformed and changed (as thou, Plato, sayest, by thy purifications), it ought to be so extreme and total a change, that by physical doctrine it be no more us;\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Hector erat tunc cum bello certabat; at ille\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tractus ab monio non erat Hector eqao;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He Hector was whilst he could fight, but when\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dragg'd by Achilles' steeds, no Hector then;\nit must be something else that must receive these recompenses:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quod mutatur... dissolvitur; interit ergo;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trajiciuntur enim partes, atque ordine migrant.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Things changed dissolved are, and therefore die;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Their parts are mix'd, and from their order fly.\"\nFor in Pythagoras's metempsychosis, and the change of habitation that he imagined in souls, can we believe that the lion, in whom the soul of Csar is enclosed, does espouse Csar's passions, or that the lion is he? For if it was still Csar, they would be in the right who, controverting this opinion with Plato, reproach him that the son might be seen to ride his mother transformed into a mule, and the like absurdities. And can we believe that in the mutations that are made of the bodies of animals into others of the same kind, the new comers are not other than their predecessors?

And why should they be offended at or punish him for wicked ones, since themselves have created in him so frail a condition, and when, with one glance of their will, they might prevent him from falling? Might not Epicurus, with great colour of human reason, object this to Plato, did he not often save himself with this sentence: \"That it is impossible to establish any thing certain of the immortal nature by the mortal?\" She does nothing but err throughout, but especially when she meddles with divine things. Who does more evidently perceive this than we? For although we have given her certain and infallible principles; and though we have enlightened her steps with the sacred lamp of truth that it has pleased God to communicate to us; we daily see, nevertheless, that if she swerve never so little from the ordinary path; and that she stray from, or wander out of the way set out and beaten by the church, how soon she loses, confounds and fetters herself, tumbling and floating in this vast, turbulent, and waving sea of human opinions, without restraint, and without any determinate end; so soon as she loses that great and common road, she enters into a labyrinth of a thousand several paths.\n\nMan cannot be any thing but what he is, nor imagine beyond the reach of his capacity. \"Tis a greater presumption,\" says Plutarch, \"in them who are but men to attempt to speak and discourse of the gods and demi-gods than it is in a man utterly ignorant of music to give an opinion of singing; or in a man who never saw a camp to dispute about arms and martial affairs, presuming by some light conjecture to understand the effects of an art he is totally a stranger to.\" Antiquity, I believe, thought to put a compliment upon, and to add something to, the divine grandeur in assimilating it to man, investing it with his faculties, and adorning it with his ugly humours and most shameful necessities; offering it our aliments to eat, presenting it with our dances, mummeries, and farces, to divert it; with our vestments to cover it, and our houses to inhabit, coaxing it with the odour of incense and the sounds of music, with festoons and nosegays; and to accommodate it to our vicious passions, flattering its justice with inhuman vengeance, and with the ruin and dissipation of things by it created and preserved as Tiberius Sempronius, who burnt the rich spoils and arms he had gained from the enemy in Sardinia for a sacrifice to Vulcan; and Paulus milius, those of Macedonia, to Mars and Minerva; and Alexander, arriving at the Indian Ocean, threw several great vessels of gold into the sea, in honour of Thetes; and moreover loading her altars with a slaughter not of innocent beasts only, but of men also, as several nations, and ours among the rest, were commonly used to do; and I believe there is no nation under the sun that has not done the same:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sulmone creatos\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quatuor hc juvenes, totidem quos educat Ufens,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Viventes rapit, inferias quos immolet umbris.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He took in flight, and living victims led,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sacrifice before his fun'ral pyre.\"\nThe Get hold themselves to be immortal, and that their death is nothing but a journey to their god Zamolxis. Every five years they dispatch some one among them to him, to entreat of him such necessaries as they stand in need of. This envoy is chosen by lot, and the form of dispatching him, after he has been instructed by word of mouth what he is to deliver, is that of the assistants, three hold up as many javelins, upon which the rest throw his body with all their force. If he happen to be wounded in a mortal part, and that he immediately dies, 'tis held a certain argument of divine favour; but if he escapes, he is looked upon as a wicked and execrable wretch, and another is dismissed after the same manner in his stead. Amestris, the mother of Xerxes, being grown old, caused at once fourteen young men, of the best families of Persia, to be buried alive, according to the religion of the country, to gratify some infernal deity. And even to this day the idols of Themixtitan are cemented with the blood of little children, and they delight in no sacrifice but of these pure and infantine souls; a justice thirsty of innocent blood:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tantum religio potuit suadere maloram.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Such impious use was of religion made,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So many demon acts it could persuade.\"\nThe Carthaginians immolated their own children to Saturn; and those who had none of their own bought of others, the father and mother being in the mean time obliged to assist at the ceremony with a gay and contented countenance.\n\nIt was a strange fancy to think to gratify the divine bounty with our afflictions; like the Lacedemonians, who regaled their Diana with the tormenting of young boys, whom they caused to be whipped for her sake, very often to death. It was a savage humour to imagine to gratify the architect by the subversion of his building, and to think to take away the punishment due to the guilty by punishing the innocent; and that poor Iphigenia, at the port of Aulis, should by her death and immolation acquit, towards God, the whole army of the Greeks from all the crimes they had committed;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Et casta inceste, nubendi tempore in ipso,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hostia concideret mactatu mosta parentis;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That the chaste virgin in her nuptial band\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should die by an unnat'ral father's hand;\"\nand that the two noble and generous souls of the two Decii, the father and the son, to incline the favour of the gods to be propitious to the affairs of Rome, should throw themselves headlong into the thickest of the enemy: Quo fuit tanta deorum iniquitas, ut placari populo Romano non possent, nisi tales viri occidissent? \"How great an injustice in the gods was it that they could not be reconciled to the people of Rome unless such men perished!\" To which may be added, that it is not for the criminal to cause himself to be scourged according to his own measure nor at his own time, but that it purely belongs to the judge, who considers nothing as chastisements but the penalty that he appoints, and cannot call that punishment which proceeds from the consent of him that suffers. The divine vengeance presupposes an absolute dissent in us, both for its justice and for our own penalty. And therefore it was a ridiculous humour of Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, who, to interrupt the continued course of his good fortune, and to balance it, went and threw the dearest and most precious jewel he had into the sea, believing that by this voluntary and antedated mishap he bribed and satisfied the revolution and vicissitude of fortune; and she, to mock his folly, ordered it so that the same jewel came again into his hands, found in the belly of a fish. And then to what end were those tearings and dismemberments of the Corybantes, the Menades, and, in our times, of the Mahometans, who slash their faces, bosoms, and limbs, to gratify their prophet; seeing that the offence lies in the will, not in the breast, eyes, genitals, roundness of form, the shoulders, or the throat? Tantus est perturbto mentis, et sedibus suis pilso, furor, ut sic dii placentur, quemadmodum ne homines quidem soviunt. \"So great is the fury and madness of troubled minds when once displaced from the seat of reason, as if the gods should be appeased with what even men are not so cruel as to approve.\" The use of this natural contexture has not only respect to us, but also to the service of God and other men; 'tis as unjust for us voluntarily to wound or hurt it as to kill ourselves upon any pretence whatever; it seems to be great cowardice and treason to exercise cruelty upon, and to destroy, the functions of the body that are stupid and servile, to spare the soul the solicitude of governing them according to reason: Ubi iratos deos timent, qui sic propitios habere merentur? In regi libidinis voluptatem castrati sunt quidam; sed nemo sibi, ne vir esset, jubente domino, mantis intulit. \"Where are they so afraid of the anger of the gods as to merit their favour at that rate?

Infirmum dei fortius est hominibs; et stultum dei sapientius est hominibus. \"For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.\" Stilpo, the philosopher, being asked, \"Whether the gods were delighted with our adorations and sacrifices?\"\u2014\"You are indiscreet,\" answered he; \"let us withdraw apart, if you would talk of such things.\" Nevertheless, we prescribe him bounds, we keep his power besieged by our reasons (I call our ravings and dreams reason, with the dispensation of philosophy, which says, \"That the wicked man, and even the fool, go mad by reason, but a particular form of reason\"), we would subject him to the vain and feeble appearances of our understandings,\u2014him who has made both us and our knowledge. Because that nothing is made of nothing, God therefore could not make the world without matter. What! has God put into our hands the keys and most secret springs of his power? Is he obliged not to exceed the limits of our knowledge? Put the case, O man! that thou hast been able here to mark some footsteps of his effects; dost thou therefore think that he has employed all he can, and has crowded all his forms and ideas in this work? Thou seest nothing but the order and revolution of this little cave in which thou art lodged, if, indeed, thou dost see so much; whereas his divinity has an infinite jurisdiction beyond.

The sun runs every day his ordinary course; the bounds of the sea and the earth cannot be confounded; the water is unstable and without firmness; a wall, unless it be broken, is impenetrable to a solid body; a man cannot preserve his life in the flames; he cannot be both in heaven and upon earth, and corporally in a thousand places at once. 'Tis for thee that he has made these rules; 'tis thee that they concern; he has manifested to Christians that he has enfranchised himself from them all when it pleased him.

Now if there be many worlds, as Democritus, Epicurus, and almost all philosophy has believed, what do we know that the principles and rules of this of ours in like manner concern the rest? They may peradventure have another form and another polity. Epicurus supposes them either like or unlike. We see in this world an infinite difference and variety, only by distance of places; neither com, wine, nor any of our animals are to be seen in that new comer of the world discovered by our fathers; 'tis all there another thing; and in times past, do but consider in how many parts of the world they had no knowledge either of Bacchus or Ceres. If Pliny and Herodotus are to be believed, there are in certain places kinds of men very little resembling us, mongrel and ambiguous forms, betwixt the human and brutal natures; there are countries where men are bom without heads, having their mouth and eyes in their breast; where they are all hermaphrodites; where they go on all four; where they have but one eye in the forehead, and a head more like a dog than like ours; where they are half fish the lower part, and live in the water; where the women bear at five years old, and live but eight; where the head and the skin of the forehead is so hard that a sword will not touch it, but rebounds again; where men have no beards; nations that know not the use of fire; others that eject seed of a black colour. What shall we say of those that naturally change themselves into wolves, colts, and then into men again? And if it be true, as Plutarch says, that in some place of the Indies there are men without mouths, who nourish themselves with the smell of certain odours, how many of our descriptions are false? He is no longer risible, nor, perhaps, capable of reason and society. The disposition and cause of our internal composition would then for the most part be to no purpose, and of no use.\n\nMoreover, how many things are there in our own knowledge that oppose those fine rules we have cut out for and prescribe to nature? And yet we must undertake to circumscribe thereto God himself! How many things do we call miraculous, and contrary to nature? This is done by every nation and by every man, according to the proportion of his ignorance. How many occult properties and quintessences do we daily discover? For, for us to go \"according to nature,\" is no more but to go \"according to our understanding,\" as far as that is able to follow, and as far as we are able to see into it; all beyond that is, forsooth, monstrous and irregular. Now, by this account, all things shall be monstrous to the wisest and most understanding men; for human reason has persuaded them that there was no manner of ground nor foundation, not so much as to be assured that snow is white, and Anaxagoras affirmed it to be black; if there be any thing, or if there be nothing; if there be knowledge or ignorance, which Metrodorus of Chios denied that man was able to determine; or whether we live, as Euripides doubts whether the life we live is life, or whether that we call death be not life, [\u2014Greek\u2014] and not without some appearance. For why do we derive the title of being from this instant, which is but a flash in the infinite course of an eternal night, and so short an interruption of our perpetual and natural condition, death possessing all the before and after this moment, and also a good part of the moment itself. Others swear there is no motion at all, as followers of Melissus, and that nothing stirs. For if there be but one, neither can that spherical motion be of any use to him, nor motion from one place to another, as Plato proves: \"That there is neither generation nor corruption in nature.\" Protagoras says that there is nothing in nature but doubt; that a man may equally dispute of all things; and even of this, whether a man can equally dispute of all things; Nausiphanes, that of things which seem to be, nothing is more than it is not; that there is nothing certain but uncertainty; Parmenides, that of that which seems, there is no one thing in general; that there is but one thing; Zeno, that one same is not, and that there is nothing; if there were one thing, it would either be in another or in itself; if it be in another, they are two; if it be in itself, they are yet two; the comprehending, and the comprehended. According to these doctrines the nature of things is no other than a shadow, either false or vain.\n\nThis way of speaking in a Christian man has ever seemed to me very indiscreet and irreverent. \"God cannot die; God cannot contradict himself; God cannot do this or that.\" I do not like to have the divine power so limited by the laws of men's mouths; and the idea which presents itself to us in those propositions ought to be more religiously and reverently expressed.\n\nOur speaking has its failings and defects, as well as all the rest. Most of the occasions of disturbance in the world are grammatical ones; our suits only spring from disputes as to the interpretation of laws; and most wars proceed from the inability of ministers clearly to express the conventions and treaties of amity of princes. How many quarrels, and of how great importance, has the doubt of the meaning of this syllable, hoc,* created in the world? Let us take the clearest conclusion that logic itself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   * Montaigne here refers to the controversies between\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     the Catholics and Protestants about transubstantiation.\npresents us withal; if you say, \"It is fine weather,\" and that you say true, it is then fine weather. Is not this a very certain form of speaking? And yet it will deceive us; that it will do so, let us follow the example: If you say, \"I lie,\" if you say true, you do lie. The art, the reason, and force of the conclusion of this, are the same with the other, and yet we are gravelled. The Pyrrhonian philosophers, I see, cannot express their general conception in any kind of speaking; for they would require a new language on purpose; ours is all formed of affirmative propositions, which are totally antarctic to them; insomuch that when they say \"I doubt,\" they are presently taken by the throat, to make them confess that at least they know and are assured that they do doubt. By which means they have been compelled to shelter themselves under this medical comparison, without which their humour would be inexplicable: when they pronounce, \"I know not,\" or, \"I doubt,\" they say that this proposition carries off itself with the rest, no more nor less than rhubarb, that drives out the ill humours, and carries itself off with them. This fancy will be more certainly understood by interrogation: \"What do I know?\" as I bear it with the emblem of a balance.\n\nSee what use they make of this irreverent way of speaking; in the present disputes about our religion, if you press its adversaries too hard, they will roundly tell you, \"that it is not in the power of God to make it so, that his body should be in paradise and upon earth, and in several places at once.\" And see, too, what advantage the old scoffer made of this. \"At least,\" says he, \"it is no little consolation to man to see that God cannot do all things; for he cannot kill himself, though he would; which is the greatest privilege we have in our condition; he cannot make mortal immortal, nor revive the dead; nor make it so, that he who has lived has not; nor that he who has had honours has not had them; having no other right to the past than that of oblivion.\" And that the comparison of man to God may yet be made out by jocose examples: \"He cannot order it so,\" says he, \"that twice ten shall not be twenty.\" This is what he says, and what a Christian ought to take heed shall not escape his lips. Whereas, on the contrary, it seems as if men studied this foolish daring of language, to reduce God to their own measure:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Cras vel atr Nube polum, Pater, occupato,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vel sole puro; non tamen irritum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quodcumque retro est efficiet, neque\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Diffinget infectumque reddet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Quod fugiens semel hora vexit.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"To-morrow, let it shine or rain,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Yet cannot this the past make vain:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Nor uncreate and render void\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  That which was yesterday enjoyed.\"\nWhen we say that the infinity of ages, as well past as to come, are but one instant with God; that his goodness, wisdom, and power are the same with his essence; our mouths speak it, but our understandings apprehend it not; and yet, such is our vain opinion of ourselves, that we must make the Divinity to pass through our sieve; and thence proceed all the dreams and errors with which the world abounds, whilst we reduce and weigh in our balance a thing so far above our poise. Mirum quo procdat improbitas cordis humani, parvulo aliquo intritata successu. \"'Tis wonderful to what the wickedness of man's heart will proceed, if elevated with the least success.\" How magisterially and insolently does Epicurus reprove the Stoics, for maintaining that the truly good and happy being appertained only to God, and that the wise man had nothing but a shadow and resemblance of it! How temerariously have they bound God to destiny (a thing which, by my consent, none that bears the name of a Christian shall ever do again)! and Thales, Plato, and Pythagoras have enslaved him to necessity. This arrogance of attempting to discover God with our eyes has been the cause that an eminent person among us has attributed to the Divinity a corporal form; and is the reason of what happens to us every day, of attributing to God important events, by a particular assignment. Because they weigh with us, they conclude that they also weigh with him, and that he has a more intent and vigilant regard to them than to others of less moment to us or of ordinary course: Magna Dii curant, parva negligunt: \"The gods are concerned at great matters, but slight the small.\" Listen to him; he will clear this to you by his reason: Nec in regnis quidem reges omnia minima curant: \"Neither indeed do kings in their administration take notice of all the least concerns.\" As if to that King of kings it were more or less to subvert a kingdom, or to move the leaf of a tree; or as if his providence acted after another manner in inclining the event of a battle than in the leap of a flea. The hand of his government is laid upon every thing after the same manner, with the same power and order; our interest does nothing towards it; our inclinations and measures sway nothing with him. Deus ita artifex magnus in magnis, ut minor non sit in parvis: \"God is so great an artificer in great things, that he is no less in the least\" Our arrogancy sets this blasphemous comparison ever before us. Because our employments are a burden to us, Strato has courteously been pleased to exempt the gods from all offices, as their priests are; he makes nature produce and support all things; and with her weights and motions make up the several parts of the world, discharging human nature from the awe of divine judgments: Quod beatum terumque sit, id nec habere negotii quicquam, nec exhibere alteri: \"What is blessed and eternal has neither any business itself nor gives any to another.\" Nature will that in like things there should be a like relation. The infinite number of mortals, therefore, concludes a like number of immortals; the infinite things that kill and destroy presupposes as many that preserve and profit. As the souls of the gods, without tongue, eye, or ear, do every one of them feel amongst themselves what the other feels, and judge our thoughts; so the souls of men, when at liberty and loosed from the body, either by sleep or some ecstacy, divine, foretell, and see things, which, whilst joined to the body, they could not see. \"Men,\" says St. Paul, \"professing themselves to be wise, they become fools; and change the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man.\" Do but take notice of the juggling in the ancient deifications. After the great and stately pomp of the funeral, so soon as the fire began to mount to the top of the pyramid, and to catch hold of the couch where the body lay, they at the same time turned out an eagle, which flying upward, signified that the soul went into Paradise. We have a thousand medals, and particularly of the worthy Faustina, where this eagle is represented carrying these deified souls to heaven with their heels upwards. 'Tis pity that we should fool ourselves with our own fopperies and inventions,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quod finxere, timent,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"They fear their own inventions,\"\nlike children who are frighted with the same face of their playfellow, that they themselves have smeared and smutted. Quasi quicquam infelicius sit homine, cui sua figmenta dominantur:\n\n\"As if any thing could be more unhappy than man, who is insulted over by his own imagination.\" 'Tis far from honouring him who made us, to honour him that we have made. Augustus had more temples than Jupiter, served with as much religion and belief of miracles. The Thracians, in return of the benefits they had received from Agesilaus, came to bring him word that they had canonized him: \"Has your nation,\" said he to them, \"the power to make gods of whom they please? Pray first deify some one amongst yourselves, and when I shall see what advantage he has by it, I will thank you for your offer.\" Man is certainly stark mad; he cannot make a worm, and yet he will be making gods by dozens. Hear Trismegistus in praise of our sufficiency: \"Of all the wonderful things, it surmounts all wonder that man could find out the divine nature and make it.\" And take here the arguments of the school of philosophy itself:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nosse cui divos et coli munina soli,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Aut soli nescire, datum.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"To whom to know the deities of heaven,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Or know he knows them not, alone 'tis given.\"\n\"If there is a God, he is a living creature; if he be a living creature, he has sense; and if he has sense, he is subject to corruption. If he be without a body he is without a soul, and consequently without action; and if he has a body, it is perishable.\" Is not here a triumph? we are incapable of having made the world; there must then be some more excellent nature that has put a hand to the work. It were a foolish and ridiculous arrogance to esteem ourselves the most perfect thing of the universe. There must then be something that is better, and that must be God. When you see a stately and stupendous edifice, though you do not know who is the owner of it, you would yet conclude it was not built for rats. And this divine structure, that we behold of the celestial palace, have we not reason to believe that it is the residence of some possessor, who is much greater than we? Is not the most supreme always the most worthy? but we are in the lowest form. Nothing without a soul and without reason can produce a living creature capable of reason. The world produces us, the world then has soul and reason. Every part of us is less than we. We are part of the world, the world therefore is endued with wisdom and reason, and that more abundantly than we. 'Tis a fine thing to have a great government; the government of the world then appertains to some happy nature. The stars do us no harm; they are then full of goodness. We have need of nourishment; then so have the gods also, and feed upon the vapours of the earth. Worldly goods are not goods to God; therefore they are not goods to us; offending and being offended are equally testimonies of imbecility; 'tis therefore folly to fear God. God is good by his nature; man by his industry, which is more. The divine and human wisdom have no other distinction, but that the first is eternal; but duration is no accession to wisdom, therefore we are companions. We have life, reason, and liberty; we esteem goodness, charity, and justice; these qualities are then in him. In conclusion, building and destroying, the conditions of the Divinity, are forged by man, according as they relate to himself. What a pattern, and what a model! let us stretch, let us raise and swell human qualities as much as we please; puff up thyself, poor man, yet more and more, and more:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Non, si tu ruperis, inquit.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Not if thou burst,\" said he.\nProfecto non Deum, quern cogitare non possunt, sed semetip pro illo cogitantes, non ilium, sed seipsos, non illi, sed sibi comparant? \"Certainly they do not imagine God, whom they cannot imagine; but they imagine themselves in his stead; they do not compare him, but themselves, not to him, but to themselves.\" In natural things the effects do but half relate to their causes. What's this to the purpose? His condition is above the order of nature, too elevated, too remote, and too mighty, to permit itself to be bound and fettered by our conclusions. 'Tis not through ourselves that we arrive at that place; our ways lie too low. We are no nearer heaven on the top of Mount Cenis than at the bottom of the sea; take the distance with your astrolabe. They debase God even to the carnal knowledge of women, to so many times, and so many generations. Paulina, the wife of Satuminus, a matron of great reputation at Rome, thinking she lay with the god Serapis, found herself in the arms of an amoroso of hers, through the panderism of the priests of his temple. Varro, the most subtle and most learned of all the Latin authors, in his book of theology, writes, that the sexton of Hercules's temple, throwing dice with one hand for himself, and with the other for Hercules, played after that manner with him for a supper and a wench; if he won, at the expense of the offerings; if he lost, at his own. The sexton lost, and paid the supper and the wench. Her name was Laurentina, who saw by night this god in her arms, who moreover told her, that the first she met the next day, should give her a heavenly reward; which proved to be Taruncius, a rich young man, who took her home to his house, and in time left her his inheritrix. She, in her turn, thinking to do a thing that would be pleasing to the god, left the people of Rome heirs to her; and therefore had divine honours attributed to her. As if it had not been sufficient that Plato was originally descended from the gods by a double line, and that he had Neptune for the common father of his race, it was certainly believed at Athens, that Aristo, having a mind to enjoy the fair Perictione, could not, and was warned by the god Apollo, in a dream, to leave her unpolluted and untouched, till she should first be brought to bed. These were the father and mother of Plato. How many ridiculous stories are there of like cuckoldings, committed by the gods against poor mortal men! And how many husbands injuriously scandaled in favour of the children! In the Mahometan religion there are Merlins enough found by the belief of the people; that is to say, children without fathers, spiritual, divinely conceived in the wombs of virgins, and carry names that signify so much in their language.\n\nWe are to observe that to every thing nothing is more dear and estimable than its being (the lion, the eagle the dolphin, prize nothing above their own kind); and that every thing assimilates the qualities of all other things to its own proper qualities, which we may indeed extend or contract, but that's all; for beyond that relation and principle our imagination cannot go, can guess at nothing else, nor possibly go out thence, nor stretch beyond it; whence spring these ancient conclusions: of all forms the most beautiful is that of man; therefore God must be of that form. No one can be happy without virtue, nor virtue be without reason, and reason cannot inhabit anywhere but in a human shape; God is therefore clothed in a human figure. Ita est informatum et anticipatum mentibus nostris, ut homini, quum de Deo cogitet, forma occurrat hu-mana. \"It is so imprinted in our minds, and the fancy is so prepossessed with it, that when a man thinks of God, a human figure ever presents itself to the imagination.\" Therefore it was that Xenophanes pleasantly said, \"That if beasts frame any gods to themselves, as 'tis likely they do, they make them certainly such as themselves are, and glorify themselves in it, as we do. For why may not a goose say thus; \"All the parts of the universe I have an interest in; the earth serves me to walk upon; the sun to light me; the stars have their influence upon me; I have such an advantage by the winds and such by the waters; there is nothing that yon heavenly roof looks upon so favourably as me; I am the darling of nature! Is it not man that keeps, lodges, and serves me? 'Tis for me that he both sows and grinds; if he eats me he does the same by his fellow-men, and so do I the worms that kill and devour him.\" As much might be said by a crane, and with greater confidence, upon the account of the liberty of his flight, and the possession of that high and beautiful region. Tam blanda conciliatrix, et tam sui est lena ipsa natura. \"So flattering and wheedling a bawd is nature to herself.\"\n\nNow by the same consequence, the destinies are then for us; for us the world; it shines it thunders for us; creator and creatures, all are for us; ''tis the mark and point to which the universality of things aims. Look into the records that philosophy has kept for two thousand years and more, of the affairs of heaven; the gods all that while have neither acted nor spoken but for man. She does not allow them any other consultation or occupation.

Man makes a thousand pretty societies betwixt God and him; is he not his countryman?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jovis incunabula Creten.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Crete, the cradle of Jupiter.\"\nAnd this is the excuse that, upon consideration of this subject, Scvola, a high priest, and Varro, a great theologian in their times, make us: \"That it is necessary that the people should be ignorant of many things that are true, and believe many things that are false.\" Quum veritatem qua liberetur inquirat credatur ei expedire quod fallitur. \"Seeing he inquires into the truth, by which he would be made free, 'tis fit he should be deceived.\" Human eyes cannot perceive things but by the forms they know; and we do not remember what a leap miserable Phton took for attempting to guide his father's horses with a mortal hand. The mind of man falls into as great a depth, and is after the same manner bruised and shattered by his own rashness. If you ask of philosophy of what matter the heavens and the sun are? what answer will she return, if not that it is iron, or, with Anaxagoras, stone, or some other matter that she makes use of? If a man inquire of Zeno what nature is? \"A fire,\" says he, \"an artisan, proper for generation, and regularly proceeding.\" Archimedes, master of that science which attributes to itself the precedency before all others for truth and certainty; \"the sun,\" says he, \"is a god of red-hot iron.\" Was not this a fine imagination, extracted from the inevitable necessity of geometrical demonstrations? Yet not so inevitable and useful but that Socrates thought it was enough to know so much of geometry only as to measure the land a man bought or sold; and that Polynus, who had been a great and famous doctor in it, despised it, as full of falsity and manifest vanity, after he had once tasted the delicate fruits of the lozelly gardens of Epicurus. Socrates in Xenophon, concerning this affair, says of Anaxagoras, reputed by antiquity learned above all others in celestial and divine matters, \"That he had cracked his brain, as all other men do who too immoderately search into knowledges which nothing belong to them:\" when he made the sun to be a burning stone, he did not consider that a stone does not shine in the fire; and, which is worse, that it will there consume; and in making the sun and fire one, that fire does not turn the complexions black in shining upon them; that we are able to look fixedly upon fire; and that fire kills herbs and plants. 'Tis Socrates's opinion, and mine too, that the best judging of heaven is not to judge of it at all. Plato having occasion, in his Timous, to speak of the demons, \"This undertaking,\" says he, \"exceeds my ability.\" We are therefore to believe those ancients who said they were begotten by them; 'tis against all reason to refuse a man's faith to the children of the gods, though what they say should not be proved by any necessary or probable reasons; seeing they engage to speak of domestic and familiar things.\n\nLet us see if we have a little more light in the knowledge of human and natural things. Is it not a ridiculous attempt for us to forge for those to whom, by our own confession, our knowledge is not able to attain, another body, and to lend a false form of our own invention; as is manifest in this motion of the planets; to which, seeing our wits cannot possibly arrive, nor conceive their natural conduct, we lend them material, heavy, and substantial springs of our own by which to move:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Temo aureus, aurea summ\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Curvatura rot, radiorum argenteus ordo.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"Gold was the axle, and the beam was gold;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The wheels with silver spokes on golden circles roll'd.\"\nYou would say that we had had coachmakers, carpenters, and painters, that went up on high to make engines of various motions, and to range the wheelwork and interfacings of the heavenly bodies of differing colours about the axis of necessity, according to Plato:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mundus domus est maxima rerum,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quam quinque altiton fragmine zon\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cingunt, per quam limbus pictus bis sex signis\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stellimicantibus, altus in obliquo there, lun\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bigas acceptat.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"The world's a mansion that doth all things hold,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which thundering zones, in number five, enfold,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through which a girdle, painted with twelve signs,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And that with sparkling constellations, shines,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In heaven's arch marks the diurnal course\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the sun's chariot and his fiery horse.\"\nThese are all dreams and fanatic follies. Why will not nature please for once to lay open her bosom to us, and plainly discover to us the means and conduct of her movements, and prepare our eyes to see them? Good God, what abuse, what mistakes should we discover in our poor science! I am mistaken if that weak knowledge of ours holds any one thing as it really is, and I shall depart hence more ignorant of all other things than my own ignorance.\n\nHave I not read in Plato this divine saying, that \"nature is nothing but enigmatic poesy!\" As if a man might perhaps see a veiled and shady picture, breaking out here and there with an infinite variety of false lights to puzzle our conjectures: Latent ista omnia crassis occullata et circumfusa tenebris; ut nulla acies humani ingenii tanta sit, qu penetrare in coelum, terram intrare, possit. \"All those things lie concealed and involved in so dark an obscurity that no point of human wit can be so sharp as to pierce heaven or penetrate the earth.\" And certainly philosophy is no other than sophisticated poetry. Whence do the ancient writers extract their authorities but from the poets? and the first of them were poets themselves, and writ accordingly. Plato is but a poet unripped. Timon calls him, insultingly, \"a monstrous forger of miracles.\" All superhuman sciences make use of the poetic style. Just as women make use of teeth of ivory where the natural are wanting, and instead of their true complexion make one of some artificial matter; as they stuff themselves out with cotton to appear plump, and in the sight of every one do paint, patch, and trick up themselves with a false and borrowed beauty; so does science (and even our law itself has, they say, legitimate fictions, whereon it builds the truth of its justice); she gives us in presupposition, and for current pay, things which she herself informs us were invented; for these epicycles, eccentrics, and concentrics, which astrology makes use of to carry on the motions of the stars, she gives us for the best she could invent upon that subject; as also, in all the rest, philosophy presents us not that which really is, or what she really believes, but what she has contrived with the greatest and most plausible likelihood of truth, and the quaintest invention. Plato, upon the discourse of the state of human bodies and those of beasts, says, \"I should know that what I have said is truth, had I the confirmation of an oracle; but this I will affirm, that what I have said is the most likely to be true of any thing I could say.\"\n\n'Tis not to heaven only that art sends her ropes, engines, and wheels; let us consider a little what she says of us ourselves, and of our contexture.\n\nThere is not more retrogradation, trepidation, accession, recession, and astonishment, in the stars and celestial bodies, than they have found out in this poor little human body. In earnest, they have good reason, upon that very account, to call it the little world, so many tools and parts have they employed to erect and build it. To assist the motions they see in man, and the various functions that we find in ourselves, in how many parts have they divided the soul, in how many places lodged it? in how many orders have they divided, and to how many stories have they raised this poor creature, man, besides those that are natural and to be perceived? And how many offices and vocations have they assigned him? They make it an imaginary public thing. 'Tis a subject that they hold and handle; and they have full power granted to them to rip, place, displace, piece, and stuff it, every one according to his own fancy, and yet they possess it not They cannot, not in reality only, but even in dreams, so govern it that there will not be some cadence or sound that will escape their architecture, as enormous as it is, and botched with a thousand false and fantastic patches. And it is not reason to excuse them; for though we are satisfied with painters when they paint heaven, earth, seas, mountains, and remote islands, that they give us some slight mark of them, and, as of things unknown, are content with a faint and obscure description; yet when they come and draw us after life, or any other creature which is known and familiar to us, we then require of them a perfect and exact representation of lineaments and colours, and despise them if they fail in it.\n\nI am very well pleased with the Milesian girl, who observing the philosopher Thales to be always contemplating the celestial arch, and to have his eyes ever gazing upward, laid something in his way that he might stumble over, to put him in mind that it would be time to take up his thoughts about things that are in the clouds when he had provided for those that were under his feet. Doubtless she advised him well, rather to look to himself than to gaze at heaven; for, as Democritus says, by the mouth of Cicero,\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Quod est ante pedes, nemo spectat: coeli scrutantur plagas.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    \"No man regards what is under his feet;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    They are always prying towards heaven.\"\nBut our condition will have it so, that the knowledge of what we have in hand is as remote from us, and as much above the clouds, as that of the stars. As Socrates says, in Plato, \"That whoever meddles with philosophy may be reproached as Thales was by the woman, that he sees nothing of that which is before him. For every philosopher is ignorant of what his neighbour does; aye, and of what he does himself, and is ignorant of what they both are, whether beasts or men.\"\n\nThose people, who find Sebond's arguments too weak, that are ignorant of nothing, that govern the world, that know all,\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Qu mare compescant caus; quid temperet annum;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Stell sponte su, jussve, vagentur et errent;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quid premat obscurum lun, quid profrt orbem;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quid velit et posait rerum concordia discors;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"What governs ocean's tides,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And through the various year the seasons guides;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whether the stars by their own proper force,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Or foreign power, pursue their wand'ring course;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why shadows darken the pale queen of night;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Whence she renews her orb and spreads her light;\u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What nature's jarring sympathy can mean;\"\nhave they not sometimes in their writings sounded the difficulties they have met with of knowing their own being? We see very well that the finger moves, that the foot moves, that some parts assume a voluntary motion of themselves without our consent, and that others work by our direction; that one sort of apprehension occasions blushing; another paleness; such an imagination works upon the spleen only, another upon the brain; one occasions laughter, another tears; another stupefies and astonishes all our senses, and arrests the motion of all our members; at one object the stomach will rise, at another a member that lies something lower; but how a spiritual impression should make such a breach into a massy and solid subject, and the nature of the connection and contexture of these admirable springs and movements, never yet man knew: Omnia incerta ratione, et in natur majestate abdita. \"All uncertain in reason, and concealed in the majesty of nature,\" says Pliny. And St Augustin, Modus quo corporibus adhorent spiritus.... omnino minis est, nec comprehendi ab homine potest; et hoc ipse homo est, \"The manner whereby souls adhere to bodies is altogether wonderful, and cannot be conceived by man, and yet this is man.\" And yet it is not so much as doubted; for the opinions of men are received according to the ancient belief, by authority and upon trust, as if it were religion and law. 'Tis received as gibberish which is commonly spoken; this truth, with all its clutter of arguments and proofs, is admitted as a firm and solid body, that is no more to be shaken, no more to be judged of; on the contrary, every one, according to the best of his talent, corroborates and fortifies this received belief with the utmost power of his reason, which is a supple utensil, pliable, and to be accommodated to any figure; and thus the world comes to be filled with lies and fopperies. The reason that men doubt of divers things is that they never examine common impressions; they do not dig to the root, where the faults and defects lie; they only debate upon the branches; they do not examine whether such and such a thing be true, but if it has been so and so understood; it is not inquired into whether Galen has said any thing to purpose, but whether he has said so or so. In truth it was very good reason that this curb to the liberty of our judgments and that tyranny over our opinions, should be extended to the schools and arts. The god of scholastic knowledge is Aristotle; 'tis irreligion to question any of his decrees, as it was those of Lucurgus at Sparta; his doctrine is a magisterial law, which, peradventure, is as false as another. I do not know why I should not as willingly embrace either the ideas of Plato, or the atoms of Epicurus, or the plenum or vacuum of Leucippus and Democritus, or the water of Thales, or the infinity of nature of Anaximander, or the air of Diogenes, or the numbers and symmetry of Pythagoras, or the infinity of Parmenides, or the One of Musus, or the water and fire of Apollodorus, or the similar parts of Anaxagoras, or the discord and friendship of Empedocles, or the fire of Heraclitus, or any other opinion of that infinite confusion of opinions and determinations, which this fine human reason produces by its certitude and clearsightedness in every thing it meddles withal, as I should the opinion of Aristotle upon this subject of the principles of natural things; which principles he builds of three pieces\u2014matter, form, and privation. And what can be more vain than to make inanity itself the cause of the production of things? Privation is a negative; of what humour could he then make the cause and original of things that are? And yet that were not to be controverted but for the exercise of logic; there is nothing disputed therein to bring it into doubt, but to defend the author of the school from foreign objections; his authority is the non-ultra, beyond which it is not permitted to inquire.\n\nIt is very easy, upon approved foundations, to build whatever we please; for, according to the law and ordering of this beginning, the other parts of the structure are easily carried on without any failure. By this way we find our reason well-grounded, and discourse at a venture; for our masters prepossess and gain beforehand as much room in our belief as is necessary towards concluding afterwards what they please, as geometricians do by their granted demands, the consent and approbation we allow them giving them wherewith to draw us to the right and left, and to whirl us about at their pleasure. Whatever springs from these presuppositions is our master and our God; he will take the level of his foundations so ample and so easy that by them he may mount us up to the clouds, if he so please. In this practice and negotiation of science we have taken the saying of Pythagoras, \"That every expert person ought to be believed in his own art\" for current pay. The logician refers the signification of words to the grammarians; the rhetorician borrows the state of arguments from the logician; the poet his measure from the musician: the geometrician his proportions from the arithmetician, and the metaphysicians take physical conjectures for their foundations; for every science has its principle presupposed, by which human judgment is everywhere kept in check. If you come to rush against the bar where the principal error lies, they have presently this sentence in their mouths, \"That there is no disputing with persons who deny principles.\" Now men can have no principles if not revealed to them by the divinity; of all the rest the beginning, the middle, and the end, is nothing but dream and vapour. To those that contend upon presupposition we must, on the contrary, presuppose to them the same axiom upon which the dispute is. For every human presupposition and declaration has as much authority one as another, if reason do not make the difference. Wherefore they are all to be put into the balance, and first the generals and those that tyrannize over us. The persuasion of certainty is a certain testimony of folly and extreme incertainty; and there are not a more foolish sort of men, nor that are less philosophers, than the Philodoxes of Plato; we must inquire whether fire be hot? whether snow be white? if there be any such things as hard or soft within our knowledge?\n\nAnd as to those answers of which they make old stories, as he that doubted if there was any such thing as heat, whom they bid throw himself into the fire; and he that denied the coldness of ice, whom they bid to put ice into his bosom;\u2014they are pitiful things, unworthy of the profession of philosophy. If they had let us alone in our natural being, to receive the appearance of things without us, according as they present themselves to us by our senses, and had permitted us to follow our own natural appetites, governed by the condition of our birth, they might then have reason to talk at that rate; but 'tis from them we have learned to make ourselves judges of the world; 'tis from them that we derive this fancy, \"That human reason is controller-general of all that is without and within the roof of heaven; that comprehends every thing, that can do every thing; by the means of which every thing is known and understood.\" This answer would be good among the cannibals, who enjoy the happiness of a long, quiet, and peaceable life, without Aristotle's precepts, and without the knowledge of the name of physics; this answer would perhaps be of more value and greater force than all those they borrow from their reason and invention; of this all animals, and all where the power of the law of nature is yet pure and simple, would be as capable as we, but as for them they have renounced it. They need not tell us, \"It is true, for you see and feel it to be so;\" they must tell me whether I really feel what I think I do; and if I do feel it, they must then tell me why I feel it, and how, and what; let them tell me the name, original, the parts and junctures of heat and cold, the qualities of the agent and patient; or let them give up their profession, which is not to admit or approve of any thing but by the way of reason; that is their test in all sorts of essays; but, certainly, 'tis a test full of falsity, error, weakness, and defect.\n\nWhich way can we better prove it than by itself? If we are not to believe her when speaking of herself, she can hardly be thought fit to judge of foreign things; if she know any thing, it must at least be her own being and abode; she is in the soul, and either a part or an effect of it; for true and essential reason, from which we by a false colour borrow the name, is lodged in the bosom of the Almighty; there is her habitation and recess; 'tis thence that she imparts her rays, when God is pleased to impart any beam of it to mankind, as Balias issued from her father's head, to communicate herself to the world.\n\nNow let us see what human reason tells us of herself and of the soul, not of the soul in general, of which almost all philosophy makes the celestial and first bodies participants; nor of that which Thales attributed to things which themselves are reputed inanimate, lead thereto by the consideration of the loadstone; but of that which appertains to us, and that we ought the best to know:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0      Ignoratur enim, qu sit natura animai;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Nata sit; an, contra, nascentibus insinuetur;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Et simnl intereat nobiscum morte dirempta;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   An tenebras Orci visat, vastasque lacunas,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   An pecudes alias divinitns insinuet se.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"For none the nature of the soul doth know,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Whether that it be born with us, or no;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Or be infused into us at our birth,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And dies with us when we return to earth,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Or then descends to the black shades below,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Or into other animals does go.\"\nCrates and Dicarchus were of opinion that there was no soul at all, but that the body thus stirs by a natural motion; Plato, that it was a substance moving of itself; Thales, a nature without repose; Aedepiades, an exercising of the senses; Hesiod and Anaximander, a thing composed of earth and water; Parmenides, of earth and fire; Empedocles, of blood:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sanguineam vomit ille animam;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"He vomits up his bloody soul.\"\nPosidonius, Cleanthes, and Galen, that it was heat or a hot complexion\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Igneus est ollis vigor, et colestis origo;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"Their vigour of fire and of heavenly race.\"\nHippocrates, a spirit diffused all over the body; Varro, that it was an air received at the mouth, heated in the lungs, moistened in the heart, and diffused throughout the whole body; Zeno, the quintessence of the four elements; Heraclides Ponticus, that it was the light; Zenocrates and the Egyptians, a mobile number; the Chaldeans, a virtue without any determinate form:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Habitum quemdam vitalem corporis esse,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Harmoniam Grci quam dicunt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"A certain vital habit in man's frame,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which harmony the Grecian sages name.\"\nLet us not forget Aristotle, who held the soul to be that which naturally causes the body to move, which he calls entelechia, with as cold an invention as any of the rest; for he neither speaks of the essence, nor of the original, nor of the nature of the soul, but only takes notice of the effect Lactantius, Seneca, and most of the Dogmatists, have confessed that it was a thing they did not understand; after all this enumeration of opinions, Harum sententiarum quo vera sit, Deus aliquis viderit: \"Of these opinions which is the true, let some god determine,\" says Cicero. \"I know by myself,\" says St Bernard, \"how incomprehensible God is, seeing I cannot comprehend the parts of my own being.\"\n\nHeraclitus, who was of opinion that every being was full of souls and demons, did nevertheless maintain that no one could advance so far towards the knowledge of the soul as ever to arrive at it; so profound was the essence of it.\n\nNeither is there less controversy and debate about seating of it.

I very willingly deliver this author to you in his own words; for should I alter eloquence itself? Besides, it were but a poor prize to steal the matter of his inventions; they are neither very frequent, nor of any great weight, and sufficiently known. But the reason why Chrysippus argues it to be about the heart, as all the rest of that sect do, is not to be omitted; \"It is,\" says he, \"because when we would affirm any things we lay our hand upon our breasts; and when we would pronounce y, which signifies I, we let the lower jaw fall towards the stomach.\" This place ought not to be passed over without a remark upon the vanity of so great a man; for besides that these considerations are infinitely light in themselves, the last is only a proof to the Greeks that they have their souls lodged in that part. No human judgment is so sprightly and vigilant that it does not sometimes sleep. Why do we fear to say? The Stoics, the fathers of human prudence, think that the soul of a man, crushed under a ruin, long labours and strives to get out, like a mouse caught in a trap, before it can disengage itself from the burden. Some hold that the world was made to give bodies, by way of punishment, to the spirits fallen, by their own fault, from the purity wherein they had been created, the first creation having been incorporeal; and that, according as they are more or less depraved from their spirituality, so are they more or less jocundly or dully incorporated; and that thence proceeds all the variety of so much created matter. But the spirit that for his punishment was invested with the body of the sun must certainly have a very rare and particular measure of change.\n\nThe extremities of our perquisition do all fall into astonishment and blindness; as Plutarch says of the testimony of histories, that, according to charts and maps, the utmost bounds of known r countries are taken up with marshes, impenetrable forests, deserts, and uninhabitable places; this is the reason why the most gross and childish ravings were most found in those authors who treat of the most elevated subjects, and proceed the furthest in them, losing themselves in their own curiosity and presumption. The beginning and end of knowledge are equally foolish; observe to what a pitch Plato flies in his poetic clouds; do but take notice there of the gibberish of the gods; but what did he dream of when he defined a man to be \"a two-legged animal without feathers: giving those who had a mind to deride him a pleasant occasion; for, having pulled a capon alive, they went about calling it the man of Plato.\"\n\nAnd what did the Epicureans think of, out of what simplicity did they first imagine that their atoms that they said were bodies having some weight, and a natural motion downwards, had made the world; till they were put in mind, by their adversaries, that, according to this description, it was impossible they should unite and join to one another, their fall being so direct and perpendicular, and making so many parallel lines throughout? Wherefore there was a necessity that they should since add a fortuitous and sideways motion, and that they should moreover accoutre their atoms with hooked tails, by which they might unite and cling to one another. And even then do not those that attack them upon this second consideration put them hardly to it? \"If the atoms have by chance formed so many sorts of figures, why did it never fall out that they made a house or a shoe? Why at the same rate should we not believe that an infinite number of Greek letters, strewed all over a certain place, might fall into the contexture of the Iliad?\"\u2014\"Whatever is capable of reason,\" says Zeno, \"is better than that which is not capable; there is nothing better than the world; the world is therefore capable of reason.\" Cotta, by this way of argumentation, makes the world a mathematician; 'and tis also made a musician and an organist by this other argumentation of Zeno: \"The whole is more than a part; we are capable of wisdom, and are part of the world; therefore the world is wise.\" There are infinite like examples, not only of arguments that are false in themselves, but silly ones, that do not hold in themselves, and that accuse their authors not so much of ignorance as imprudence, in the reproaches the philosophers dash one another in the teeth withal, upon their dissensions in their sects and opinions.\n\nWhoever should bundle up a lusty faggot of the fooleries of human wisdom would produce wonders. I willingly muster up these few for a pattern, by a certain meaning not less profitable to consider than the most sound and moderate instructions. Let us judge by these what opinion we are to have of man, of his sense and reason, when in these great persons that have raised human knowledge so high, so many gross mistakes and manifest errors are to be found.\n\nFor my part, I am apt to believe that they have treated of knowledge casually, and like a toy, with both hands; and have contended about reason as of a vain and frivolous instrument, setting on foot all sorts of fancies and inventions, sometimes more sinewy, and sometimes weaker. This same Plato, who defines man as if he were a cock, says elsewhere, after Socrates, \"That he does not, in truth, know what man is, and that he is a member of the world the hardest to understand.\" By this variety and instability of opinions, they tacitly lead us, as it were by the hand, to this resolution of their irresolution. They profess not always to deliver their opinions barefaced and apparent to us; they have one while disguised them in the fabulous shadows of poetry, and at another in some other vizor; for our imperfection carries this also along with it, that crude meat is not always proper for our stomachs; we must dry, alter, and mix it; they do the same; they sometimes conceal their real opinions and judgments, and falsify them to accommodate themselves to the public use. They will not make an open profession of ignorance, and of the imbecility of human reason, that they may not fright children; but they sufficiently discover it to us under the appearance of a troubled and inconstant science.\n\nI advised a person in Italy, who had a great mind to speak Italian, that provided he only had a desire to make himself understood, without being ambitious in any other respect to excel, that he should only make use of the first word that came to the tongue's end, whether Latin, French, Spanish, or Gascon, and that, by adding the Italian termination, he could not fail of hitting upon some idiom of the country, either Tuscan, Roman, Venetian, Piedmontese, or Neapolitan, and so fall in with some one of those many forms. I say the same of Philosophy; she has so many faces, so much variety, and has said so many things, that all our dreams and ravings are there to be found. Human fancy can conceive nothing good or bad that is not there: Nihil tam absurde did potest, quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosophorum. \"Nothing can be said so absurd, that has not been said before by some of the philosophers.\" And I am the more willing to expose my whimsies to the public; forasmuch as, though they are spun out of myself, and without any pattern, I know they will be found related to some ancient humour, and some will not stick to say, \"See whence he took it!\" My manners are natural, I have not called in the assistance of any discipline to erect them; but, weak as they are, when it came into my head to lay them open to the world's view, and that to expose them to the light in a little more decent garb I went to adorn them with reasons and examples, it was a wonder to myself accidentally to find them conformable to so many philosophical discourses and examples. I never knew what regimen my life was of till it was near worn out and spent; a new figure\u2014an unpremeditated and accidental philosopher.\n\nBut to return to the soul. Inasmuch as Plato has placed reason in the brain, anger in the heart, and concupiscence in the liver; 'tis likely that it was rather an interpretation of the movements of the soul, than that he intended a division and separation of it, as of a body, into several members. And the most likely of their opinions is that 'tis always a soul, that by its faculty, reasons, remembers, comprehends, judges, desires, and exercises all its other operations by divers instruments of the body; as the pilot guides his ship according to his experience, one while straining or slacking the cordage, one while hoisting the mainyard, or removing the rudder, by one and the same power carrying on several effects; and that it is lodged in the brain; which appears in that the wounds and accidents that touch that part do immediately offend the faculties of the soul; and 'tis not incongruous that it should thence diffuse itself through the other parts of the body\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Medium non deserit unquam\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coeli Phoebus iter; radiis tamen omnia lustrt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"Phoebus ne'er deviates from the zodiac's way;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yet all things doth illustrate with his ray.\"\nAs the sun sheds from heaven its light and influence, and fills the world with them:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ctera pars animas, per totum dissita corpus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Paret, et ad numen mentis momenque movetur.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"The other part o' th' soul diffus'd all o'er\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The body, does obey the reason's lore.\"\nSome have said that there was a general soul, as it were a great body, whence all the particular souls were extracted, and thither again return, always restoring themselves to that universal matter:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deum namque ire per omnes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Terrasque, tractusque maris, columque profundum;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scilicet hue reddi deinde, ac resoluta referri\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Omnia; nec morti esse locum:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"For God goes forth, and spreads throughout the whole\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Heaven, earth, and sea, the universal soul;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each at its birth, from him all beings share,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Both man and brute, the breath of vital air;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To him return, and, loos'd from earthly chain,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fly whence they sprung, and rest in God again,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Spurn at the grave, and, fearless of decay,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Dwell in high heaven, and star th' ethereal way.\"\nOthers, that they only rejoined and reunited themselves to it; others, that they were produced from the divine substance; others, by the angels of fire and air; others, that they were from all antiquity; and some that they were created at the very point of time the bodies wanted them; others make them to descend from the orb of the moon, and return thither; the generality of the ancients believed that they were begotten from father to son, after a like manner, and produced with all other natural things; taking their argument from the likeness of children to their fathers;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Instillata patris virtus tibi;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fortes creantur fortibus, et bonis;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Thou hast thy father's virtues with his blood:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For still the brave spring from the brave and good;\"\nand that we see descend from fathers to their children not only bodily marks, but moreover a resemblance of humours, complexions, and inclinations of the soul:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Denique cur acris violentia triste leonum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seminium sequitur?

Forasmuch, in the first place, as that we do not justly remember any thing but what we have been taught, and that if the memory did purely perform its office it would at least suggest to us something more than what we have learned. Secondly, that which she knew being in her purity, was a true knowledge, knowing things as they are by her divine intelligence; whereas here we make her receive falsehood and vice when we instruct her; wherein she cannot employ her reminiscence, that image and conception having never been planted in her. To say that the corporal prison does in such sort suffocate her natural faculties, that they are there utterly extinct, is first contrary to this other belief of acknowledging her power to be so great, and the operations of it that men sensibly perceive in this life so admirable, as to have thereby concluded that divinity and eternity past, and the immortality to come:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nam si tantopere est anirai mutata potestas,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Omnia ut actarum exciderit retinentia rerum,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non, ut opinor, ea ab letho jam longior errat.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"For if the mind be changed to that degree\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As of past things to lose all memory,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So great a change as that, I must confess,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Appears to me than death but little less.\"\nFurthermore, 'tis here with us, and not elsewhere, that the force and effects of the soul ought to be considered; all the rest of her perfections are vain and useless to her; 'tis by her present condition that all her immortality is to be rewarded and paid, and of the life of man only that she is to render an account It had been injustice to have stripped her of her means and powers; to have disarmed her in order, in the time of her captivity and imprisonment in the flesh, of her weakness and infirmity in the time wherein she was forced and compelled, to pass an infinite and perpetual sentence and condemnation, and to insist upon the consideration of so short a time, peradventure but an hour or two, or at the most but a century, which has no more proportion with infinity than an instant; in this momentary interval to ordain and definitively to determine of her whole being; it were an unreasonable disproportion, too, to assign an eternal recompense in consequence of so short a life. Plato, to defend himself from this inconvenience, will have future payments limited to the term of a hundred years, relatively to human duration; and of us ourselves there are enough who have given them temporal limits. By this they judged that the generation of the soul followed the common condition of human things, as also her life, according to the opinion of Epicurus and Democritus, which has been the most received; in consequence of these fine appearances that they saw it bom, and that, according as the body grew more capable, they saw it increase in vigour as the other did; that its feebleness in infancy was very manifest, and in time its better strength and maturity, and after that its declension and old age, and at last its decrepitude:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gigni pariter cum corpore, et una\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Crescere sentimus, pariterque senescere mentem.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Souls with the bodies to be born we may\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Discern, with them t' increase, with them decay.\"\nThey perceived it to be capable of divers passions, and agitated with divers painful motions, whence it fell into lassitude and uneasiness;

By what can we better convince him, than by so gross blindness in so apparent a light? For the contrary opinion of the immortality of the soul, which, Cicero says, was first introduced, according to the testimony of books at least, by Pherecydes\n\nSyrius, in the time of King Tullus (though some attribute it to Thales, and others to others), 'tis the part of human science that is treated of with the greatest doubt and\n\nreservation. The most positive dogmatists are fain, in this point principally, to fly to the refuge of the Academy. No one doubts what Aristotle has established upon this subject, no more than all the ancients in general, who handle it with a wavering belief: Rem gratissimam promittentium magis quam probantium: \"A thing more acceptable in the promisors than the provers.\" He conceals himself in clouds of words of difficult, unintelligible sense, and has left to those of his sect as great a dispute about his judgment as about the matter itself.\n\nTwo things rendered this opinion plausible to them; one, that, without the immortality of souls, there would be nothing whereon to ground the vain hopes of glory, which is a consideration of wonderful\n\nrepute in the world; the other, that it is a very profitable impression, as Plato says, that vices, when they escape the discovery and cognizance of human justice, are still within the reach of the divine, which will pursue them even after the death of the guilty. Man is excessively solicitous to prolong his being, and has to the utmost of his power provided for it; there are monuments for the conservation of the body, and glory to preserve the name. He has employed all his wit and opinion to the rebuilding of himself, impatient of his fortune, and to prop himself by his inventions. The soul, by reason of its anxiety and impotence, being unable to stand by itself, wanders up and down to seek out consolations, hopes, and foundations, and alien circumstances, to which she adheres and fixes; and how light or fantastic soever invention delivers them to her, relies more willingly, and with greater assurance, upon them than upon herself. But 'tis wonderful to observe how the most constant and obstinate maintainers of this just and clear persuasion of the immortality of the soul fall short, and how weak their arguments are, when they go about to prove it by human reason: Somnia sunt non docentis, sed optantis: \"They are dreams, not of the teacher, but wisher,\" says one of the ancients. By which testimony man may know that he owes the truth he himself finds out to fortune and accident; since that even then, when it is fallen into his hand, he has not wherewith to hold and maintain it, and that his reason has not force to make use of it. All things produced by our own meditation and understanding, whether true or false, are subject to incertitude and controversy. 'Twas for the chastisement of our pride, and for the instruction of our miserable condition and incapacity, that God wrought the perplexity and confusion of the tower of Babel. Whatever we undertake without his assistance, whatever we see without the lamp of his grace, is but vanity and folly. We corrupt the very essence of truth, which is uniform and constant, by our weakness, when fortune puts it into our possession. What course soever man takes of himself, God still permits it to come to the same confusion, the image whereof he so lively represents to us in the just chastisement wherewith he crushed Nimrod's presumption, and frustrated the vain attempt of his proud structure; Perdam sapientiam sapientium, et prudentiam prudentium reprobabo. \"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.\" The diversity of idioms and tongues, with which he disturbed this work, what are they other than this infinite and perpetual alteration and discordance of opinions and reasons, which accompany and confound the vain building of human wisdom, and to very good effect too; for what would hold us, if we had but the least grain of knowledge? This saint has very much obliged me: Ipsa veritatis occultatio ant humili-tatis exercitatio est, aut elationis attritio \"The very concealment of the truth is either an exercise of humility or a quelling of presumption.\" To what a pitch of presumption and insolence do we raise our blindness and folly!\n\nBut to return to my subject. It was truly very good reason that we should be beholden to God only, and to the favour of his grace, for the truth of so noble a belief, since from his sole bounty we receive the fruit of immortality, which consists in the enjoyment of eternal beatitude. Let us ingenuously confess that God alone has dictated it to us, and faith; for 'tis no lesson of nature and our own reason. And whoever will inquire into his own being and power, both within and without, without this divine privilege; whoever shall consider man impartially, and without flattery, will see in him no efficacy or faculty that relishes of any thing but death and earth. The more we give and confess to owe and render to God, we do it with the greater Christianity. That which this Stoic philosopher says he holds from the fortuitous consent of the popular voice; had it not been better that he had held it from God? Cum de animarum otemitate disserimus, non leve momentum apud nos habet consensus hominum aut timentium inferos, aut colentium. Utor hc public persuasione. \"When we discourse of the immortality of souls, the consent of men that either fear or adore the infernal powers, is of no small advantage. I make use of this public persuasion.\" Now the weakness of human arguments upon this subject is particularly manifested by the fabulous circumstances they have superadded as consequences of this opinion, to find out of what condition this immortality of ours was. Let us omit the Stoics, (usuram nobis largiuntur tanquam cornicibus; diu mansuros aiunt animos; semper, negant. \"They give us a long life, as also they do to crows; they say our soul shall continue long, but that it shall continue always they deny,\") who give to souls a life after this, but finite. The most universal and received fancy, and that continues down to our times in various places, is that of which they make Pythagoras the author; not that he was the original inventor, but because it received a great deal of weight and repute by the authority of his approbation: \"That souls, at their departure out of us, did nothing but shift from one body to another, from a lion to a horse, from a horse to a king, continually travelling at this rate from habitation to habitation;\" and he himself said that he remembered he had been tha-lides, since that Euphorbus, afterwards Hermotimus, and, finally, from Pyrrhus was passed into Pythagoras; having a memory of himself of two hundred and six years. And some have added that these very souls sometimes mount up to heaven, and come down again:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O pater, aime aliquas ad colum hinc ire putandum est\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sublimes animas, iterumque ad tarda reverti\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corpora?

The opinion that Varro mentions is that, after four hundred and forty years' revolution, they should be reunited to their first bodies; Chrysippus held that this would happen after a certain space of time unknown and unlimited. Plato, who professes to have embraced this belief from Pindar and the ancient poets, that we are to undergo infinite vicissitudes of mutation, for which the soul is prepared, having neither punishment nor reward in the other world but what is temporal, as its life here is but temporal, concludes that it has a singular knowledge of the affairs of heaven, of hell, of the world, through all which it has passed, repassed, and made stay in several voyages, are matters for her memory. Observe her progress elsewhere: \"The soul that has lived well is reunited to the stars to which it is assigned; that which has lived ill removes into a woman, and if it do not there reform, is again removed into a beast of condition suitable to its vicious manners, and shall see no end of its punishments till it be returned to its natural constitution, and that it has, by the force of reason, purged itself from those gross, stupid, and elementary qualities it was polluted with.\" But I will not omit the objection the Epicureans make against this transmigration from one body to another; 'tis a pleasant one; they ask what expedient would be found out if the number of the dying should chance to be greater than that of those who are coming into the world. For the souls, turned out of their old habitation, would scuffle and crowd which should first get possession of their new lodging; and they further demand how they shall pass away their time, whilst waiting till new quarters are made ready for them? Or, on the contrary, if more animals should be born than die, the body, they say, would be but in an ill condition whilst waiting for a soul to be infused into it; and it would fall out that some bodies would die before they had been alive.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Denique comrabia ad Veneris, partusque ferarum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Esse animas prsto, deridiculum esse videtur;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Et spectare immortales mortalia membra\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Innumero numro, certareque prproperanter\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inter se, qu prima potissimaq insinueter.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Absurd to think that whilst wild beasts beget,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or bear their young, a thousand souls do wait,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Expect the falling body, fight and strive\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which first shall enter in and make it live.\"\nOthers have arrested the soul in the body of the deceased, with it to animate serpents, worms, and other beasts, which are said to be bred out of the corruption of our members, and even out of our ashes; others divide them into two parts, the one mortal, the other immortal; others make it corporeal, and nevertheless immortal. Some make it immortal, without\nsense or knowledge. There are others, even among ourselves, who have believed that devils were made of the souls of the damned; as Plutarch thinks that gods were made of those that were saved; for there are few things which that author is so positive in as he is in this; maintaining elsewhere a doubtful and ambiguous way of expression. \"We are told,\" says he, \"and steadfastly should believe, that the souls of virtuous men, both according to nature and the divine justice, become saints, and from saints demigods, and from demigods, after they are perfectly, as in sacrifices of purgation, cleansed and purified, being delivered from all passibility and all mortality, they become, not by any civil decree, but in real truth, and according to all probability of reason, entire and perfect gods, in receiving a most happy and glorious end.\" But who desires to see him\u2014him, who is yet the most sober and moderate of the whole gang of philosophers, lay about him with greater boldness, and relate his miracles upon this subject, I refer him to his treatise of the Moon, and of the Demon of Socrates, where he may, as evidently as in any other place whatever, satisfy himself that the mysteries of philosophy have many strange things in common with those of poetry; human understanding losing itself in attempting to sound and search all things to the bottom; even as we, tired and worn out with a long course of life, return to infancy and dotage. See here the fine and certain instructions which we extract from human knowledge concerning the soul.\n\nNeither is there less temerity in what they teach us touching our corporal parts. Let us choose out one or two examples; for otherwise we should lose ourselves in this vast and troubled ocean of medical errors. Let us first know whether, at least, they agree about the matter whereof men produce one another; for as to their first production it is no wonder if, in a thing so high and so long since past, human understanding finds itself puzzled and perplexed. Archelaus, the physician, whose disciple and favourite Socrates was, according to Aristoxenus, said that both men and beasts were made of a lacteous slime, expressed by the heat of the earth; Pythagoras says that our seed is the foam or cream of our better blood; Plato, that it is the distillation of the marrow of the backbone; raising his argument from this, that that part is first sensible of being weary of the work; Alcmeon, that it is part of the substance of the brain, and that it is so, says he, is proved by the weakness of the eyes in those who are immoderate in that exercise; Democritus, that it is a substance extracted from the whole mass of the body; Epicurus, an extract from soul and body; Aristotle, an excrement drawn from the aliment of the blood, the last which is diffused over our members; others, that it is a blood concocted and digested by the heat of the genitals, which they judge, by reason that in excessive endeavours a man voids pure blood; wherein there seems to be more likelihood, could a man extract any appearance from so infinite a confusion. Now, to bring this seed to do its work, how many contrary opinions do they set on foot? Aristotle and Democritus are of opinion that women have no sperm, and that 'tis nothing but a sweat that they distil in the heat of pleasure and motion, and that contributes nothing at all to generation. Galen, on the contrary, and his followers, believe that without the concurrence of seeds there can be no generation. Here are the physicians, the philosophers, the lawyers, and divines, by the ears with our wives about the dispute, \"For what term women carry their fruit?\" and I, for my part, by the example of myself, stick with those that maintain a woman goes eleven months with child. The world is built upon this experience; there is no so commonplace a woman that cannot give her judgment in all these controversies; and yet we cannot agree.\n\nHere is enough to verify that man is no better instructed in the knowledge of himself, in his corporal than in his spiritual part We have proposed himself to himself, and his reason to his reason, to see what she could say. I think I have sufficiently demonstrated how little she understands herself in herself; and who understands not himself in himself, in what can he? Quasi vero mensuram ullius rei possit agere, qui sui nesciat. \"As if he could understand the measure of any other thing, that knows not his own.\" In earnest, Protagoras told us a pretty flam in making man the measure of all things, that never knew so much as his own; and if it be not he, his dignity will not permit that any other creature should have this advantage; now he being so contrary in himself, and one judgment so incessantly subverting another, this favourable proposition was but a mockery, which induced us necessarily to conclude the nullity of the compass and the compasser. When Thales reputes the knowledge of man very difficult for man to comprehend, he at the same time gives him to understand that all other knowledge is impossible.\n\nYou,* for whom I have taken the pains, contrary to my custom, to write so long a discourse, will not refuse to support your Sebond by the ordinary forms of arguing, wherewith you are every day instructed, and in this will exercise both your wit and learning; for this last fencing trick is never to be made use of but as an extreme remedy; 'tis a desperate thrust, wherein you are to quit your own arms to make your adversary abandon his; and a secret sleight, which must be very rarely, and then very reservedly, put in practice. 'Tis great temerity to lose yourself that you may destroy another; you must not die to be revenged, as Gobrias did; for, being closely grappled in combat with a lord of Persia, Darius coming in sword in hand, and fearing to strike lest he should kill Gobrias, he called out to him boldly to fall on,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* The author, as we have already mentioned, is addressing\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Margaret de Valois.\nthough he should run them both through at once. I have known desperate weapons, and conditions of single combat, and wherein he that offered them put himself and his adversary upon terms of inevitable death to them both, censured for unjust. The Portuguese, in the Indian Sea, took certain Turks prisoners, who, impatient of their captivity, resolved, and it succeeded, by striking the nails of the ship one against another, and making a spark to fall into the barrels of powder that were set in the place where they were guarded, to blow up and reduce themselves, their masters, and the vessel to ashes. We here touch the out-plate and utmost limits of sciences, wherein the extremity is vicious, as in virtue. Keep yourselves in the common road; it is not good to be so subtle and cunning. Remember the Tuscan proverb:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chi troppo s'assottiglia, si scavezza.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Who makes himself too wise, becomes a fool.\"\nI advise you that, in all your opinions and discourses, as well as in your manners and all other things, you keep yourself moderate and temperate, and avoid novelty; I am an enemy to all extravagant ways. You, who by the authority of your grandeur, and yet more by the advantages which those qualities give you that are more your own, may with the twinkle of an eye command whom you please, ought to have given this charge to some one who made profession of letters, who might after a better manner have proved and illustrated these things to you. But here is as much as you will stand in need of.\n\nEpicurus said of the laws, \"That the worst were so necessary for us that without them men would devour one another.\" And Plato affirms, \"That without laws we should live like beasts.\" Our wit is a wandering, dangerous, and temerarious utensil; it is hard to couple any order or measure to it; in those of our own time, who are endued with any rare excellence above others, or any extraordinary vivacity of understanding, we see them almost all lash out into licentiousness of opinions and manners; and 'tis almost a miracle to find one temperate and sociable. 'Tis all the reason in the world to limit human wit within the strictest limits imaginable; in study, as in all the rest, we ought to have its steps and advances numbered and fixed, and that the limits of its inquisition be bounded by art. It is curbed and fettered by religions, laws, customs, sciences, precepts, mortal and immortal penalties. And yet we see that it escapes from all these bonds by its volubility and dissolution; *tis a vain body which has nothing to lay hold on or to seize; a various and difform body, incapable of being either bound or held. In earnest, there are few souls so regular, firm, and well descended, as are to be trusted with their own conduct, and that can with moderation, and without temerity, sail in the liberty of their own judgments, beyond the common and received opinions; *tis more expedient to put them under pupilage. Wit is a dangerous weapon, even to the possessor, if he knows not how to use it discreetly; and there is not a beast to whom a headboard is more justly to be given, to keep his looks down and before his feet, and to hinder him from wandering here and there out of the tracks which custom and the laws have laid before him. And therefore it will be better for you to keep yourself in the beaten path, let it be what it will, than to fly out at a venture with this unbridled liberty. But if any of these new doctors will pretend to be ingenious in your presence, at the expense both of your soul and his own, to avoid this dangerous plague, which is every day laid in your way to infect you, this preservative, in the extremest necessity, will prevent the danger and hinder the contagion of this poison from offending either you or your company.\n\nThe liberty, then, and frolic forwardness of these ancient wits produced in philosophy and human sciences several sects of different opinions, every one undertaking to judge and make choice of what he would stick to and maintain. But now that men go all one way, Qui certis quibusdam destinatisque sententiis addicti et consecrati sunt, ut etiam, qu non probant, cogantur defendere, \"Who are so tied and obliged to certain opinions that they are bound to defend even those they do not approve,\" and that we receive the arts by civil authority and decree, so that the schools have but one pattern, and a like circumscribed institution and discipline, we no more take notice what the coin weighs, and is really worth, but every one receives it according to the estimate that common approbation and use puts upon it; the alloy is not questioned, but how much it is current for. In like manner all things pass; we take physic as we do geometry; and tricks of hocus-pocus, enchantments, and love-spells, the correspondence of the souls of the dead, prognostications, domifications, and even this ridiculous pursuit of the philosophers' stone, all things pass for current pay, without any manner of scruple or contradiction. We need to know no more but that Mars' house is in the middle of the triangle of the hand, that of Venus in the thumb, and that of Mercury in the little finger; that when the table-line cuts the tubercle of the forefinger 'tis a sign of cruelty, that when it falls short of the middle finger, and that the natural median-line makes an angle with the vital in the same side, 'tis a sign of a miserable death; that if in a woman the natural line be open, and does not close the angle with the vital, this denotes that she shall not be very chaste. I leave you to judge whether a man qualified with such knowledge may not pass with reputation and esteem in all companies.\n\nTheophrastus said that human knowledge, guided by the senses, might judge of the causes of things to a certain degree; but that being arrived to first and extreme causes, it must stop short and retire, by reason either of its own infirmity or the difficulty of things. 'Tis a moderate and gentle opinion, that our own understandings may conduct us to the knowledge of some things, and that it has certain measures of power, beyond which 'tis temerity to employ it; this opinion is plausible, and introduced by men of well composed minds, but 'tis hard to limit our wit, which is curious and greedy, and will no more stop at a thousand than at fifty paces; having experimentally found that, wherein one has failed, the other has hit, and that what was unknown to one age, the age following has explained; and that arts and sciences are not cast in a mould, but are formed and perfected by degrees, by often handling and polishing, as bears leisurely lick their cubs into form; what my force cannot discover, I do not yet desist to sound and to try; and by handling and kneading this new matter over and over again, by turning and heating it, I lay open to him that shall succeed me, a kind of facility to enjoy it more at his ease, and make it more maniable and supple for him,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ut hymettia sole\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cera remollescit, tractataque poll ice multas\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vertitur in facies, ipsoque fit utilis usu;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As wax doth softer in the sun become,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, tempered 'twixt the finger and the thumb,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Will varions forms, and several shapes admit,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till for the present use 'tis rendered fit;\"\nas much will the second do for the third; which is the cause that the difficulty ought not to make me despair, and my own incapacity as little; for 'tis nothing but my own.\n\nMan is as capable of all things as of some; and if he confesses, as Theophrastus says, the ignorance of first causes, let him at once surrender all the rest of his knowledge; if he is defective in foundation, his reason is aground; disputation and inquiry have no other aim nor stop but principles; if this aim do not stop his career, he runs into an infinite irresolution. Non potest aliud alio magis minusve comprehendi, quoniam omnium rerum una est dejinitio comprehendendi:\n\n\"One thing can no more or less be comprehended than another, because the definition of comprehending all things is the same.\" Now 'tis very likely that, if the soul knew any thing, it would in the first place know itself; and if it knew any thing out of itself, it would be its own body and case, before any thing else. If we see the gods of physic to this very day debating about our anatomy,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mulciber in Trojam, pro Troj stabat Apollo;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Vulcan against, for Troy Apollo stood;\"\nwhen are we to expect that they will be agreed? We are nearer neighbours to ourselves than whiteness to snow, or weight to stones. If man do not know himself, how should he know his force and functions? It is not, perhaps, that we have not some real knowledge in us; but 'tis by chance; forasmuch as errors are received into our soul by the same way, after the same manner, and by the same conduct, it has not wherewithal to distinguish them, nor wherewithal to choose the truth from falsehood.\n\nThe Academics admitted a certain partiality of judgment, and thought it too crude to say that it was not more likely to say that snow was white than black; and that we were no more assured of the motion of a stone, thrown by the hand, than of that of the eighth sphere. And to avoid this difficulty and strangeness, that can in truth hardly lodge in our imagination, though they concluded that we were in no sort capable of knowledge, and that truth is engulfed in so profound an abyss as is not to be penetrated by human sight; yet they acknowledged some things to be more likely than others, and received into their judgment this faculty, that they had a power to incline to one appearance more than another, they allowed him this propension, interdicting all resolution. The Pyrrhonian opinion is more bold, and also somewhat more likely; for this academic inclination, and this propension to one proposition rather than another, what is it other than a recognition of some more apparent truth in this than in that? If our understanding be capable of the form, lineaments, port, and face of truth, it might as well see it entire as by halves, springing and imperfect This appearance of likelihood, which makes them rather take the left hand than the right, augments it; multiply this ounce of verisimilitude that turns the scales to a hundred, to a thousand, ounces; it will happen in the end that the balance will itself end the controversy, and determine one choice, one entire truth. But why do they suffer themselves to incline to and be swayed by verisimilitude, if they know not the truth? How should they know the similitude of that whereof they do not know the essence? Either we can absolutely judge, or absolutely we cannot If our intellectual and sensible faculties are without foot or foundation, if they only pull and drive, 'tis to no purpose that we suffer our judgments to be carried away with any part of their operation, what appearance soever they may seem to present us; and the surest and most happy seat of our understanding would be that where it kept itself temperate, upright, and inflexible, without tottering, or without agitation: Inter visa, vera aut falsa, ad animi assensum, nihil interest: \"Amongst things that seem, whether true or false, it signifies nothing to the assent of the mind.\" That things do not lodge in us in their form and essence, and do not there make their entry by their own force and authority, we sufficiently see; because, if it were so, we should receive them after the same manner; wine would have the same relish with the sick as with the healthful; he who has his finger chapt or benumbed would find the same hardness in wood or iron that he handles that another does; foreign subjects then surrender themselves to our mercy, and are seated in us as we please. Now if on our part we received any thing without alteration, if human grasp were capable and strong enough to seize on truth by our own means, these means being common to all men, this truth would be conveyed from hand to hand, from one to another; and at least there would be some one thing to be found in the world, amongst so many as there are, that would be believed by men with an universal consent; but this, that there is no one proposition that is not debated and controverted amongst us, or that may not be, makes it very manifest that our natural judgment does not very clearly discern what it embraces; for my judgment cannot make my companions approve of what it approves; which is a sign that I seized it by some other means than by a natural power that is in me and in all other men.\n\nLet us lay aside this infinite confusion of opinions, which we see even amongst the philosophers themselves, and this perpetual and universal dispute about the knowledge of things; for this is truly presupposed, that men, I mean the most knowing, the best bom, and of the best parts, are not agreed about any one thing, not that heaven is over our heads; for they that doubt of every thing, do also doubt of that; and they who deny that we are able to comprehend any thing, say that we have not comprehended that the heaven is over our heads, and these two opinions are, without comparison, the stronger in number.\n\nBesides this infinite diversity and division, through the trouble that our judgment gives ourselves, and the incertainty that every one is sensible of in himself, 'tis easy to perceive that its seat is very unstable and insecure. How variously do we judge of things?\u2014How often do we alter our opinions? What I hold and believe to-day I hold and believe with my whole belief; all my instruments and engines seize and take hold of this opinion, and become responsible to me for it, at least as much as in them lies; I could not embrace nor conserve any truth with greater confidence and assurance than I do this; I am wholly and entirely possessed with it; but has it not befallen me, not only once, but a hundred, a thousand times, every day, to have embraced some other thing with all the same instruments, and in the same condition, which I have since judged to be false? A man must at least become wise at his own expense; if I have often found myself betrayed under this colour; if my touch proves commonly false, and my balance unequal and unjust, what assurance can I now have more than at other times? Is it not stupidity and madness to suffer myself to be so often deceived by my guide? Nevertheless, let fortune remove and shift us five hundred times from place to place, let her do nothing but incessantly empty and fill into our belief, as into a vessel, other and other opinions; yet still the present and the last is the certain and infallible one; for this we must abandon goods, honour, life, health, and all.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Posterior.... res ilia reperta\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perdit, et immutat sensus ad pristina qnqne.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The last things we find out are always best,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And make us to disrelish all the rest.\"\nWhatever is preached to us, and whatever we learn, we should still remember that it is man that gives and man that receives; 'tis a mortal hand that presents it to us; 'tis a mortal hand that accepts it The things that come to us from heaven have the sole right and authority of persuasion, the sole mark of truth; which also we do not see with our own eyes, nor receive by our own means; that great and sacred image could not abide in so wretched a habitation if God for this end did not prepare it, if God did not by his particular and supernatural grace and favour fortify and reform it. At least our frail and defective condition ought to make us behave ourselves with more reservedness and moderation in our innovations and changes; we ought to remember that, whatever we receive into the understanding, we often receive things that are false, and that it is by the same instruments that so often give themselves the lie and are so often deceived.\n\nNow it is no wonder they should so often contradict themselves, being so easy to be turned and swayed by very light occurrences. It is certain that our apprehensions, our judgment, and the faculties of the soul in general, suffer according to the movements and alterations of the body, which alterations are continual. Are not our minds more sprightly, ou memories more prompt and quick, and our thoughts more lively, in health than in sickness? Do not joy and gayety make us receive subjects that present themselves to our souls quite otherwise than care and melancholy? Do you believe that Catullus's verses, or those of Sappho, please an old doting miser as they do a vigorous, amorous young man? Cleomenes, the son of Anexandridas, being sick, his friends reproached him that he had humours and whimsies that were new and unaccustomed; \"I believe it,\" said he; \"neither am I the same man now as when I am in health; being now another person, my opinions and fancies are also other than they were before.\" In our courts of justice this word is much in use, which is spoken of criminals when they find the judges in a good humour, gentle, and mild, Gaudeat de bon fortun ; \"Let him rejoice in his good fortune;\" for it is most certain that men's judgments are sometimes more prone to condemnation, more sharp and severe, and at others more facile, easy, and inclined to excuse; he that carries with him from his house the pain of the gout, jealousy, or theft by his man, having his whole soul possessed with anger, it is not to be doubted but that his judgment will lean this way. That venerable senate of the Areopagites used to hear and determine by night, for fear lest the sight of the parties might corrupt their justice. The very air itself, and the serenity of heaven, will cause some mutation in us, according to these verses in Cicero:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tales sunt hominnm mentes, quali pater ipse\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jupiter auctifer lustravit lampade terras.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Men's minds are influenc'd by th' external air,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dark or serene, as days are foul or fair.\"\n'Tis not only fevers, debauches, and great accidents, that overthrow our judgments,\u2014the least things in the world will do it; and we are not to doubt, though we may not be sensible of it, that if a continued fever can overwhelm the soul, a tertian will in some proportionate measure alter it; if an apoplexy can stupefy and totally extinguish the sight of our understanding, we are not to doubt but that a great cold will dazzle it; and consequently there is hardly one single hour in a man's whole life wherein our judgment is in its due place and right condition, our bodies being subject to so many continual mutations, and stuffed with so many several sorts of springs, that I believe the physicians, that it is hard but that there must be always some one or other out of order.\n\nAs to what remains, this malady does not very easily discover itself, unless it be extreme and past remedy; forasmuch as reason goes always lame, halting, and that too as well with falsehood as with truth; and therefore 'tis hard to discover her deviations and mistakes. I always call that appearance of meditation which every one forges in himself reason; this reason, of the condition of which there may be a hundred contrary ones about one and the same subject, is an instrument of lead and of wax, ductile, pliable, and accommodate to all sorts of biases, and to all measures; so that nothing remains but the art and skill how to turn and mould it. How uprightly soever a judge may mean, if he does not look well to himself, which few care to do, his inclination to friendship, to relationship, to beauty or revenge, and not only things of that weight, but even the fortuitous instinct that makes us favour one thing more than another, and that, without reason's permission, puts the choice upon us in two equal subjects, or some shadow of like vanity, may insensibly insinuate into his judgment the recommendation or disfavour of a cause, and make the balance dip.\n\nI, that watch myself as narrowly as I can, and that have my eyes continually bent upon myself, like one that has no great business to do elsewhere,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quis sub Arcto Rex gelid metuatur or,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quid Tyridatem terreat, unice Securus,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I care not whom the northern clime reveres,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or what's the king that Tyridates fears,\"\ndare hardly tell the vanity and weakness I find in myself My foot is so unstable and unsteady, I find myself so apt to totter and reel, and my sight so disordered, that, fasting, I am quite another man than when full; if health and a fair day smile upon me, I am a very affable, good-natured man; if a corn trouble my toe, I am sullen, out of humour, and not to be seen. The same pace of a horse seems to me one while hard, and another easy; and the same way one while shorter, and another longer; and the same form one while more, another less agreeable: I am one while for doing every thing, and another for doing nothing at all; and what pleases me now would be a trouble to me at another time. I have a thousand senseless and casual actions within myself; either I am possessed by melancholy or swayed by choler; now by its own private authority sadness predominates in me, and by and by, I am as merry as a cricket. When I take a book in hand I have then discovered admirable graces in such and such passages, and such as have struck my soul; let me light upon them at another time, I may turn and toss, tumble and rattle the leaves to no purpose; 'tis then to me an inform and undiscovered mass. Even in my own writings I do not always find the air of my first fancy; I know not what I would have said, and am often put to it to correct and pump for a new sense, because I have lost the first that was better. I do nothing but go and come; my judgment does not always advance\u2014it floats and roams:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Velut minuta magno\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deprensa navis in mari vesaniente vento.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Like a small bark that's tost upon the main.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When winds tempestuous heave the liquid plain.\"\nVery often, as I am apt to do, having for exercise taken to maintain an opinion contrary to my own, my mind, bending and applying itself that way, does so engage me that way that I no more discern the reason of my former belief, and forsake it I am, as it were, misled by the side to which I incline, be it what it will, and carried away by my own weight. Every one almost would say the same of himself, if he considered himself as I do. Preachers very well know that the emotions which steal upon them in speaking animate them towards belief; and that in passion we are more warm in the defence of our proposition, take ourselves a deeper impression of it, and embrace it with greater vehemence and approbation than we do in our colder and more temperate state. You only give your counsel a simple brief of your cause; he returns you a dubious and uncertain answer, by which you find him indifferent which side he takes. Have you feed him well that he may relish it the better, does he begin to be really concerned, and do you find him interested and zealous in your quarrel? his reason and learning will by degrees grow hot in your cause; behold an apparent and undoubted truth presents itself to his understanding; he discovers a new light in your business, and does in good earnest believe and persuade himself that it is so. Nay, I do not know whether the ardour that springs from spite and obstinacy, against the power and violence of the magistrate and danger, or the interest of reputation, may not have made some men, even at the stake, maintain the opinion for which, at liberty, and amongst friends, they would not have burned a finger. The shocks and jostles that the soul receives from the body's passions can do much in it, but its own can do a great deal more; to which it is so subjected that perhaps it may be made good that it has no other pace and motion but from the breath of those winds, without the agitation of which it would be becalmed and without action, like a ship in the middle of the sea, to which the winds hare denied their assistance. And whoever should maintain this, siding with the Peripatetics, would do us no great wrong, seeing it is very well known that the greatest and most noble actions of the soul proceed from, and stand in need of, this impulse of the passions. Valour, they say, cannot be perfect without the assistance of anger; Semper Ajax fortis, fortissimus tamen in furore; \"Ajax was always brave, but most when in a fury:\" neither do we encounter the wicked and the enemy vigorously enough if we be not angry; nay, the advocate, it is said, is to inspire the judges with indignation, to obtain justice.\n\nIrregular desires moved Themistocles, and Demosthenes, and have pushed on the philosophers to watching, fasting, and pilgrimages; and lead us to honour, learning, and health, which are all very useful ends. And this meanness of soul, in suffering anxiety and trouble, serves to breed remorse and repentance in the conscience, and to make us sensible of the scourge of God, and politic correction for the chastisement of our offences; compassion is a spur to clemency; and the prudence of preserving and governing ourselves is roused by our fear; and how many brave actions by ambition! how many by presumption! In short, there is no brave and spiritual virtue without some irregular agitation. May not this be one of the reasons that moved the Epicureans to discharge God from all care and solicitude of our affairs; because even the effects of his goodness could not be exercised in our behalf without disturbing its repose, by the means of passions which are so many spurs and instruments pricking on the soul to virtuous actions; or have they thought otherwise, and taken them for tempests, that shamefully hurry the soul from her tranquillity? Ut maris tranquillitas intettigitur, null, ne minima quidem, aura fluctus commovente: Sic animi quietus et placatus status cemitur, quum perturbatis nulla est, qua moveri queat.. \"As it is understood to be a calm sea when there is not the least breath of air stirring; so the state of the soul is discerned to be quiet and appeased when there is no perturbation to move it.\"\n\nWhat varieties of sense and reason, what contrariety of imaginations does the diversity of our passions inspire us with! What assurance then can we take of a thing so mobile and unstable, subject by its condition to the dominion of trouble, and never going other than a forced and borrowed pace? If our judgment be in the power even of sickness and perturbation; if it be from folly and rashness that it is to receive the impression of things, what security can we expect from it?\n\nIs it not a great boldness in philosophy to believe that men perform the greatest actions, and nearest approaching the Divinity, when they are furious, mad, and beside themselves? We better ourselves by the privation of our reason, and drilling it. The two natural ways to enter into the cabinet of the gods, and there to foresee the course of destiny, are fury and sleep.\n\nThis is pleasant to consider; by the dislocation that passions cause in our reason, we become virtuous; by its extirpation, occasioned by madness or the image of death, we become diviners and prophets. I was never so willing to believe philosophy in any thing as this. 'Tis a pure enthusiasm wherewith sacred truth has inspired the spirit of philosophy, which makes it confess, contrary to its own proposition, that the most calm, composed, and healthful estate ef the soul that philosophy can seat it in is not its best condition; our waking is more a sleep than sleep itself, our wisdom less wise than folly; our dreams are worth more than our meditation; and the worst place we can take is in ourselves. But does not philosophy think that we are wise enough to consider that the voice that the spirit utters, when dismissed from man, so clear-sighted, so great, and so perfect, and whilst it is in man so terrestrial, ignorant, and dark, is a voice proceeding from the spirit of dark, terrestrial, and ignorant man, and for this reason a voice not to be trusted and believed?\n\nI, being of a soft and heavy complexion, have no great experience of these vehement agitations, the most of which surprise the soul on a sudden, without giving it leisure to recollect itself. But the passion that is said to be produced by idleness in the hearts of young men, though it proceed leisurely, and with a measured progress, does evidently manifest, to those who have tried to oppose its power, the violence our judgment suffers in this alteration and conversion. I have formerly attempted to withstand and repel it; for I am so far from being one of those that invite vices, that I do not so much as follow them, if they do not haul me along; I perceived it to spring, grow, and increase, in spite of my resistance; and at last, living and seeing as I was, wholly to seize and possess me. So that, as if rousing from drunkenness, the images of things began to appear to me quite other than they used to be; I evidently saw the advantages of the object I desired, grow, and increase, and expand by the influence of my imagination, and the difficulties of my attempt to grow more easy and smooth; and both my reason and conscience to be laid aside; but this fire being evaporated in an instant, as from a flash of lightning, I was aware that my soul resumed another kind of sight, another state, and another judgment; the difficulties of retreat appeared great and invincible, and the same things had quite another taste and aspect than the heat of desire had presented them to me; which of the two most truly? Pyrrho knows nothing about it. We are never without sickness. Agues have their hot and cold fits; from the effects of an ardent passion we fall again to shivering; as much as I had advanced, so much I retired:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Qualis ubi alterno procurrens gurgite pontus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nunc ruit ad terras, scopulosque superjacit undam\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spumeus, extremamque sinu perfundit arenam;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nunc rapidus retro, atque stu revoluta resorbens\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saxa, fugit, littusque vado labente relihquit.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So swelling surges, with a thundering roar,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Driv'n on each others' backs, insult the shore,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bound o'er the rocks, encroach upon the land,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And far upon the beach heave up the sand;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then backward rapidly they take their way,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Repulsed from upper ground, and seek the sea.\"\nNow, from the knowledge of this volubility of mine, I have accidentally begot in myself a certain constancy of opinions, and have not much altered those that were first and natural in me; for what appearance soever there may be in novelty, I do not easily change, for fear of losing by the bargain; and, as I am not capable of choosing, I take other men's choice, and keep myself in the station wherein God has placed me; I could not otherwise keep myself from perpetual rolling. Thus have I, by the grace of God, preserved myself entire, without anxiety or trouble of conscience, in the ancient faith of our religion, amidst so many sects and divisions as our age has produced. The writings of the ancients, the best authors I mean, being full and solid, tempt and carry me which way almost they will; he that I am reading seems always to have the most force; and I find that every one in his turn is in the right, though they contradict one another. The facility that good wits have of rendering every thing likely they would recommend, and that nothing is so strange to which they do not undertake to give colour enough to deceive such simplicity as mine, this evidently shows the weakness of their testimony. The heavens and the stars have been three thousand years in motion; all the world were of that belief till Cleanthes the Samian, or, according to Theophrastus, Nicetas of Syracuse, took it into his head to maintain that it was the earth that moved, turning about its axis by the oblique circle of the zodiac. And Copernicus has in our times so grounded this doctrine that it very regularly serves to all astrological consequences; what use can we make of this, if not that we ought not much to care which is the true opinion? And who knows but that a third, a thousand years hence, may over throw the two former.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sic volvenda tas commutt tempora rerum:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quod fuit in pretio, fit nullo denique honore;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Porro aliud succedit, et e contemptibus exit,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inque dies magis appetitur, floretque repertum\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laudibus, et miro est mortales inter honore.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Thus ev'ry thing is changed in course of time,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What now is valued passes soon its prime;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To which some other thing, despised before,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Succeeds, and grows in vogue still more and more;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And once received, too faint all praises seem,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So highly it is rais'd in men's esteem.\"\nSo that when any new doctrine presents itself to us, we have great reason to mistrust, and to consider that, before that was set on foot, the contrary had been generally received; and that, as that has been overthrown by this, a third invention, in time to come, may start up which may damn the second. Before the principles that Aristotle introduced were in reputation, other principles contented human reason, as these satisfy us now. What patent have these people, what particular privilege, that the career of our invention must be stopped by them, and that the possession of our whole future belief should belong to them? They are no more exempt from being thrust out of doors than their predecessors were. When any one presses me with a new argument, I ought to believe that what I cannot answer another can; for to believe all likelihoods that a man cannot confute is great simplicity; it would by that means come to pass that all the vulgar (and we are all of the vulgar) would have their belief as tumable as a weathercock; for their souls, being so easy to be imposed upon, and without any resistance, must of force incessantly receive other and other impressions, the last still effacing all footsteps of that which went before. He that finds himself weak ought to answer, according to practice, that he will speak with his counsel, or refer himself to the wiser, from whom he received his instruction. How long is it that physic has been practised in the world? 'Tis said that a new comer, called Paracelsus, changes and overthrows the whole order of ancient rules, and maintains that, till now, it has been of no other use but to kill men. I believe he will easily make this good, but I do not think it were wisdom to venture my life in making trial of his own experience. We are not to believe every one, says the precept, because every one can say all things. A man of this profession of novelties and physical reformations not long since told me that all the ancients were notoriously mistaken in the nature and motions of the winds, which he would evidently demonstrate to me if I would give him the hearing. After I had with some patience heard his arguments, which were all full of likelihood of truth: \"What, then,\" said I, \"did those that sailed according to Theophrastus make way westward, when they had the prow towards the east? did they go sideward or backward?\" \"That's fortune,\" answered he, \"but so it is that they were mistaken.\" I replied that I had rather follow effects than reason. Now these are things that often interfere with one another, and I have been told that in geometry (which pretends to have gained the highest point of certainty of all science) there are inevitable demonstrations found which subvert the truth of all experience; as Jacques Pelletier told me, at my own house, that he had found out two lines stretching themselves one towards the other to meet, which nevertheless he affirmed, though extended to infinity, could never arrive to touch one another. And the Pyrrhonians make no other use of their arguments and their reason than to ruin the appearance of experience; and 'tis a wonder how far the suppleness of our reason has followed them in this design of controverting the evidence of effects; for they affirm that we do not move, that we do not speak, and that there is neither weight nor heat, with the same force of argument that we affirm the most likely things. Ptolemy, who was a great man, had established the bounds of this world of ours; all the ancient philosophers thought they had the measure of it, excepting some remote isles that might escape their knowledge; it had been Pyrrhonism, a thousand years ago, to doubt the science of cosmography, and the opinions that every one had received from it; it was heresy to admit the antipodes; and behold, in this age of ours, there is an infinite extent of terra firma discovered, not an island or single country, but a division of the world, nearly equal in greatness to that we knew before. The geographers of our time stick not to assure us that now all is found; all is seen:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nam quod adest prosto, placet, et pollere videtur;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What's present pleases, and appears the best;\"\nbut it remains to be seen whether, as Ptolemy was therein formerly deceived upon the foundation of his reason, it were not very foolish to trust now in what these people say? And whether it is not more likely that this great body, which we call the world, is not quite another thing than what we imagine.\n\nPlato says that it changes countenance in all respects; that the heavens, the stars, and the sun, have all of them sometimes motions retrograde to what we see, changing east into west The Egyptian priests told Herodotus that from the time of their first king, which was eleven thousand and odd years since (and they showed him the effigies of all their kings in statues taken from the life), the sun had four times altered his course; that the sea and the earth did alternately change into one another; that the beginning of the world is undetermined; Aristotle and Cicero both say the same; and some amongst us are of opinion that it has been from all eternity, is mortal, and renewed again by several vicissitudes; calling Solomon and Isaiah to witness; to evade those oppositions, that God has once been a creator without a creature; that he has had nothing to do, that he got rid of that idleness by putting his hand to this work; and that consequently he is subject to change. In the most famous of the Greek schools the world is taken for a god, made by another god greater than he, and composed of a body, and a soul fixed in his centre, and dilating himself by musical numbers to his circumference; divine, infinitely happy, and infinitely great, infinitely wise and eternal; in him are other gods, the sea, the earth, the stars, who entertain one another with an harmonious and perpetual agitation and divine dance, sometimes meeting, sometimes retiring from one another; concealing and discovering themselves; changing their order, one while before, and another behind. Heraclitus was positive that the world was composed of fire; and, by the order of destiny, was one day to be enflamed and consumed in fire, and then to be again renewed. And Apuleius says of men: Sigillatim mortales, cunctim perpetui. \"That they are mortal in particular, and immortal in general.\" Alexander writ to his mother the narration of an Egyptian priest, drawn from their monuments, testifying the antiquity of that nation to be infinite, and comprising the birth and progress of other countries. Cicero and Diodorus say that in their time the Chaldees kept a register of four hundred thousand and odd years, Aristotle, Pliny, and others, that Zoroaster flourished six thousand years before Plato's time. Plato says that they of the city of Sais have records in writing of eight thousand years; and that the city of Athens was built a thousand years before the said city of Sais; Epicurus, that at the same time things are here in the posture we see, they are alike and in the same manner in several other worlds; which he would have delivered with greater assurance, had he seen the similitude and concordance of the new discovered world of the West Indies with ours, present and past, in so many strange examples.\n\nIn earnest, considering what is come to our knowledge from the course of this terrestrial polity, I have often wondered to see in so vast a distance of places and times such a concurrence of so great a number of popular and wild opinions, and of savage manners and beliefs, which by no means seem to proceed from our natural meditation. The human mind is a great worker of miracles! But this relation has, moreover, I know not what of extraordinary in it; 'tis found to be in names, also, and a thousand other things; for they found nations there (that, for aught we know, never heard of us) where circumcision was in use; where there were states and great civil governments maintained by women only, without men; where our fasts and Lent were represented, to which was added abstinence from women; where our crosses were several ways in repute; here they were made use of to honour and adorn their sepultures, there they were erected, and particularly that of St Andrew, to protect themselves from nocturnal visions, and to lay upon the cradles of infants against enchantments; elsewhere there was found one of wood, of very great height, which was adored for the god of rain, and this a great way in the interior; there was seen an express image of our penance priests, the use of mitres, the celibacy of priests, the art of divination by the entrails of sacrificed beasts, abstinence from all sorts of flesh and fish in their diet, the manner of priests officiating in a particular and not a vulgar language; and this fancy, that the first god was driven away by a second, his younger brother; that they were created with all sorts of necessaries and conveniences, which have since been in a degree taken from them for their sins, their territory changed, and their natural condition made worse; that they were of old overwhelmed by the inundation of water from heaven; that but few families escaped, who retired into caves on high mountains, the mouths of which they stopped so that the waters could not get in, having shut up, together with themselves, several sorts of animals; that when they perceived the rain to cease they sent out dogs, which returning clean and wet, they judged that the water was not much abated; afterwards sending out others, and seeing them return dirty, they issued out to repeople the world, which they found only full of serpents. In one place we met with the belief of a day of judgment; insomuch that they were marvellously displeased at the Spaniards for discomposing the bones of the dead, in rifling the sepultures for riches, saying that those bones so disordered could not easily rejoin; the traffic by exchange, and no other way; fairs and markets for that end; dwarfs and deformed people for the ornament of the tables of princes; the use of falconry, according to the nature of their hawks; tyrannical subsidies; nicety in gardens; dancing, tumbling tricks, music of instruments, coats of arms, tennis-courts, dice and lotteries, wherein they are sometimes so eager and hot as to stake themselves and their liberty; physic, no otherwise than by charms; the way of writing in cypher; the belief of only one first man, the father of all nations; the adoration of one God, who formerly lived a man in perfect virginity, fasting, and penitence, preaching the laws of nature, and the ceremonies of religion, and that vanished from the world without a natural death; the theory of giants; the custom of making themselves drunk with their beverages, and drinking to the utmost; religious ornaments painted with bones and dead men's skulls; surplices, holy water sprinkled; wives and servants, who present themselves with emulation, burnt and interred with the dead husband or master; a law by which the eldest succeeds to all the estate, no part being left for the younger but obedience; the custom that, upon promotion to a certain office of great authority, the promoted is to take upon him a new name, and to leave that which he had before; another to strew lime upon the knee of the new-born child, with these words:\n\n\"From dust thou earnest, and to dust thou must return;\" as also the art of augury. The vain shadows of our religion, which are observable in some of these examples, are testimonies of its dignity and divinity. It is not only in some sort insinuated into all the infidel nations on this side of the world, by a certain imitation, but in these barbarians also, as by a common and supernatural inspiration; for we find there the belief of purgatory, but of a new form; that which we give to the fire they give to the cold, and imagine that souls are purged and punished by the rigour of an excessive coldness. And this example puts me in mind of another pleasant diversity; for as there were there some people who delighted to unmuffle the ends of their instruments, and clipped off the prepuce after the Mahometan and Jewish manner; there were others who made so great conscience of laying it bare, that they carefully pursed it up with little strings to keep that end from peeping into the air; and of this other diversity, that whereas we, to honour kings and festivals, put on the best clothes we have; in some regions, to express their disparity and submission to their king, his subjects present themselves before him in their vilest habits, and entering his palace, throw some old tattered garment over their better apparel, to the end that all the lustre and ornament may solely be in him. But to proceed:\u2014\n\nIf nature enclose within the bounds of her ordinary progress the beliefs, judgments, and opinions of men, as well as all other things; if they have their revolution, their season, their birth and death, like cabbage plants; if the heavens agitate and rule them at their pleasure, what magisterial and permanent authority do we attribute to them? If we experimentally see that the form of our beings depends upon the air, upon the climate, and upon the soil, where we are bom, and not only the colour, the stature, the complexion, and the countenances, but moreover the very faculties of the soul itself: Et plaga codi non solum ad robor corporum, sed etiam anirum facit: \"The climate is of great efficacy, not only to the strength of bodies, but to that of souls also,\" says Vegetius; and that the goddess who founded the city of Athens chose to situate it in a temperature of air fit to make men prudent, as the Egyptian priests told Solon: Athenis tenue colum; ex quo etiam acutiores putantur Attici; crassum Thebis; itaque pingues Thebani, et valentes: \"The air of Athens is subtle and thin; whence also the Athenians are reputed to be more acute; and at Thebes more gross and thick; wherefore the Thebans are looked upon as more heavy-witted and more strong.\" In such sort that, as fruits and animals grow different, men are also more or less warlike, just, temperate, and docile; here given to wine, elsewhere to theft or uncleanness; here inclined to superstition, elsewhere to unbelief; in one place to liberty, in another to servitude; capable of one science or of one art, dull or ingenious, obedient or mutinous, good or bad, according as the place where they are seated inclines them; and assume a new complexion, if removed, like trees, which was the reason why Cyrus would not grant the Persians leave to quit their rough and craggy country to remove to another more pleasant and even, saying, that fertile and tender soils made men effeminate and soft. If we see one while one art and one belief flourish, and another while another, through some celestial influence; such an age to produce such natures, and to incline mankind to such and such a propension, the spirits of men one while gay and another gray, like our fields, what becomes of all those fine prerogatives we so soothe ourselves withal? Seeing that a wise man may be mistaken, and a hundred men and a hundred nations, nay, that even human nature itself, as we believe, is many ages wide in one thing or another, what assurances have we that she should cease to be mistaken, or that in this very age of ours she is not so?\n\nMethinks that amongst other testimonies of our imbecility, this ought not to be forgotten, that man cannot, by his own wish and desire, find out what he wants; that not in fruition only, but in imagination and wish, we cannot agree about what we would have to satisfy and content us. Let us leave it to our own thought to cut out and make up at pleasure; it cannot so much as covet what is proper for it, and satisfy itself:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quid enim ratione timemus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Aut cupimus?

For that which our reason advises us to, as the most likely, is generally for every one to obey the laws of his country, as was the advice of Socrates, inspired, as he says, by a divine counsel; and by that, what would it say, but that our duty has no other rule but what is accidental? Truth ought to have a like and universal visage; if man could know equity and justice that had a body and a true being, he would not fetter it to the conditions of this country or that; it would not be from the whimsies of the Persians or Indians that virtue would receive its form. There is nothing more subject to perpetual agitation than the laws; since I was born, I have known those of the English, our neighbours, three or four times changed, not only in matters of civil regimen, which is the only thing wherein constancy may be dispensed with, but in the most important subject that can be, namely, religion, at which I am the more troubled and ashamed, because it is a nation with whom those of my province have formerly had so great familiarity and acquaintance, that there yet remains in my house some footsteps of our ancient kindred; and here with us at home, I have known a thing that was capital to become lawful; and we that hold of others are likewise, according to the chance of war, in a possibility of being one day found guilty of high-treason, both divine and human, should the justice of our arms fall into the power of injustice, and, after a few years' possession, take a quite contrary being. How could that ancient god more clearly accuse the ignorance of human knowledge concerning the divine Being, and give men to understand that their religion was but a thing of their own contrivance, useful as a bond to their society, than declaring as he did to those who came to his tripod for instruction, that every one's true worship was that which he found in use in the place where he chanced to be? O God, what infinite obligation have we to the bounty of our sovereign Creator, for having disabused our belief from these wandering and arbitrary devotions, and for having seated it upon the eternal foundation of his holy word? But what then will philosophers say to us in this necessity? \"That we follow the laws of our country;\" that is to say, this floating sea of the opinions of a republic, or a prince, that will paint out justice for me in as many colours, and form it as many ways as there are changes of passions in themselves; I cannot suffer my judgment to be so flexible. What kind of virtue is that which I see one day in repute, and that to-morrow shall be in none, and which the crossing of a river makes a crime? What sort of truth can that be, which these mountains limit to us, and make a lie to all the world beyond them?\n\nBut they are pleasant, when, to give some certainty to the laws, they say, that there are some firm, perpetual, and immovable, which they call natural, that are imprinted in human kind by the condition of their own proper being; and of these some reckon three, some four, some more, some less; a sign that it is a mark as doubtful as the rest Now they are so unfortunate, (for what can I call it else but misfortune that, of so infinite a number of laws, there should not be found one at least that fortune and the temerity of chance has suffered to be universally received by the consent of all nations?) they are, I say, so miserable, that of these three or four select laws, there is not so much as one that is not contradicted and disowned, not only by one nation, but by many. Now, the only likely sign, by which they can argue or infer some natural laws, is the universality of approbation; for we should, without doubt, follow with a common consent that which nature had truly ordained us; and not only every nation, but every private man, would resent the force and violence that any one should do him who would tempt him to any thing contrary to this law. But let them produce me one of this condition. Proctagoras and Aristo gave no other essence to the justice of laws than the authority and opinion of the legislator; and that, these laid aside, the honest and the good lost their qualities, and remained empty names of indifferent things; Thrasymachus, in Plato, is of opinion that there is no other right but the convenience of the superior. There is not any thing wherein the world is so various as in laws and customs; such a thing is abominable here which is elsewhere in esteem, as in Lacedemon dexterity in stealing; marriages between near relations, are capitally interdicted amongst us; they are elsewhere in honour:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gentes esse ferantur,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In quibus et nato genitrix, et nata parenti\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jungitur, et pietas geminato crescit amore;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There are some nations in the world, 'tis said,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where fathers daughters, sons their mothers wed;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And their affections thereby higher rise,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More firm and constant by these double ties;\"\nthe murder of infants, the murder of fathers, the community of wives, traffic of robberies, license in all sorts of voluptuousness; in short, there is nothing so extreme that is not allowed by the custom of some nation or other.\n\nIt is credible that there are natural laws for us, as we see them in other creatures; but they are lost in us, this fine human reason everywhere so insinuating itself to govern and command, as to shuffle and confound the face of things, according to its own vanity and inconstancy: Nihil itaque amplius nostrum est; quod nostrum dico, artis est: \"Therefore nothing is any more truly ours; what we call ours belongs to art.\" Subjects have divers lustres and divers considerations, and thence the diversity of opinions principally proceeds; one nation considers a subject in one aspect, and stops there: another takes it in a different point of view.\n\nThere is nothing of greater horror to be imagined than for a man to eat his father; and yet the people, whose ancient custom it was so to do, looked upon it as a testimony of piety and affection, seeking thereby to give their progenitors the most worthy and honourable sepulture; storing up in themselves, and as it were in their own marrow, the bodies and relics of their fathers; and in some sort regenerating them by transmutation into their living flesh, by means of nourishment and digestion. It is easy to consider what a cruelty and abomination it must have appeared to men possessed and imbued with this snperstition to throw their fathers' remains to the corruption of the earth, and the nourishment of beasts and worms.\n\nLycurgus considered in theft the vivacity, diligence, boldness, and dexterity of purloining any thing from our neighbours, and the benefit that redounded to the public that every one should look more narrowly to the conservation of what was his own; and believed that, from this double institution of assaulting and defending, advantage was to be made for military discipline (which was the principal science and virtue to which he would inure that nation), of greater consideration than the disorder and injustice of taking another man's goods.\n\nDionysius, the tyrant, offered Plato a robe of the Persian fashion, long, damasked, and perfumed; Plato refused it, saying, \"That being born a man, he would not willingly dress himself in women's clothes;\" but Aristippus accepted it with this answer, \"That no accoutrement could corrupt a chaste courage.\" His friends reproaching him with meanness of spirit, for laying it no more to heart that Dionysius had spit in his face, \"Fishermen,\" said he, \"suffer themselves to be drenched with the waves of the sea from head to foot to catch a gudgeon.\" Diogenes was washing cabbages, and seeing him pass by, \"If thou couldst live on cabbage,\" said he, \"thou wouldst not fawn upon a tyrant;\" to whom Aristippus replied, \"And if thou knewest how to live amongst men, thou wouldst not be washing cabbages.\" Thus reason finds appearances for divers effects; 'tis a pot with two ears that a man may take by the right or left:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bellum, o terra hospita, portas:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bello armantur eqni; bellum hc armenta minantur.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sed tamen idem olim curru succedere sueti\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quadrupedes, et frena jugo concordia ferre;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spes est pacis.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"War, war is threatened from this foreign ground\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (My father cried), where warlike steeds are found.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet, since reclaimed, to chariots they submit,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peace may succeed to war.\"\nSolon, being lectured by his friends not to shed powerless and unprofitable tears for the death of his son, \"It is for that reason that I the more justly shed them,\" said he, \"because they are powerless and unprofitable.\" Socrates's wife exasperated her grief by this circumstance: \"Oh, how unjustly do these wicked judges put him to death!\" \"Why,\" replied he, \"hadst thou rather they should execute me justly?\" We have our ears bored; the Greeks looked upon that as a mark of slavery. We retire in private to enjoy our wives; the Indians do it in public.

The advocates and judges of our times find bias enough in all causes to accommodate them to what they themselves think fit. In so infinite a science, depending upon the authority of so many opinions, and so arbitrary a subject, it cannot be but that of necessity an extreme confusion of judgments must arise; there is hardly any suit so clear wherein opinions do not very much differ; what one court has determined one way another determines quite contrary, and itself contrary to that at another time. Of which we see very frequent examples, owing to that practice admitted amongst us, and which is a marvellous blemish to the ceremonious authority and lustre of our justice, of not abiding by one sentence, but running from judge to judge, and court to court, to decide one and the same cause.\n\nAs to the liberty of philosophical opinions concerning vice and virtue, 'tis not necessary to be insisted upon; therein are found many opinions that are better concealed than published to weak minds. Arcesilaus said, \"That in venery it was no matter where, or with whom, it was committed:\" Et obsccenas voluptates, si natura requirit, non genere, aut loco, aut ordine, sed forma, otate, jigur, metiendas Epicurus putat.... ne amores quidem sanctos a sapiente alienos esse arbitrantur.... Queeramus, ad quam usque otatem juvenes amandi sint. \"And obscene pleasures, if nature requires them,\" Epicurus thinks, \"are not to be measured either by race, kind, place, or rank, but by age, shape, and beauty.... Neither are sacred loves thought to be foreign to wise men;... we are to inquire till what age young men are to be loved.\" These last two stoical quotations, and the reproach that Dicarchus threw into the teeth of Plato himself, upon this account, show how much the soundest philosophy indulges licenses and excesses very remote from common custom.\n\nLaws derive their authority from possession and custom. 'Tis dangerous to trace them back to their beginning; they grow great, and ennoble themselves, like our rivers, by running on; but follow them upward to their source, 'tis but a little spring, scarce discernable,\n\nthat swells thus, and thus fortifies itself by growing old. Do but consult the ancient considerations that gave the first motion to this famous torrent, so full of dignity, awe, and reverence, you will find them so light and weak that it is no wonder if these people, who weigh and reduce every thing to reason, and who admit nothing by authority, or upon trust, have their judgments often very remote, and differing from those of the public. It is no wonder if people, who take their pattern from the first image of nature, should in most of their opinions swerve from the common path; as, for example, few amongst them would have approved of the strict conditions of our marriages, and most of them have been for having wives in common, and without obligation; they would refuse our ceremonies. Chrysippus said, \"That a philosopher would make a dozen somersaults, aye, and without his breeches, for a dozen of olives.\"\nThat philosopher would hardly have advised Clisthenes to have refused Hippoclides the fair Agarista his daughter, for having seen him stand on his head upon a table. Metrocles somewhat indiscreetly broke wind backwards while in disputation, in the presence of a great auditory in his school, and kept himself hid in his own house for shame, till Crates coming to visit him, and adding to his consolations and reasons the example of his own liberty, by falling to try with him who should sound most, cured him of that scruple, and withal drew him to his own stoical sect, more free than that more reserved one of the Peripatetics, of which he had been till then. That which we call decency, not to dare to do that in public which is decent enough to do in private, the Stoics call foppery; and to mince it, and to be so modest as to conceal and disown what nature, custom, and our desires publish and proclaim of our actions, they reputed a vice. The other thought it was to undervalue the mysteries of Venus to draw them out of the private oratory, to expose them to the view of the people; and that to bring them out from behind the curtain was to debase them. Modesty is a thing of weight; secrecy, reservation, and circumspection, are parts of esteem. Pleasure did very ingeniously when, under the mask of virtue, she sued not to be prostituted in the open streets, trodden under foot, and exposed to the public view, wanting the dignity and convenience of her private cabinets. Hence some say that to put down public stews is not only to disperse fornication into all places, that was confined to one, but moreover, by the difficulty, to incite wild and idle people to this vice:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mochus es Aufidi, qui vir,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scvine, fuisti:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rivalis fuerat qui tuus, ille vir est.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cur alina placet tibi, qu tua non placet uxor?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Numquid securus non potes arrigere?\nThis experience diversifies itself in a thousand examples:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nullus in urbe fuit tot, qui tangere vellet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Uxorem gratis, Cciliane, tuam,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dum licuit: sed nunc, positis custodibus, ingens\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turba fututorum est. Ingeniosus homo es.\nA philosopher being taken in the very act, and asked what he was doing, coldly replied, \"I am planting man;\" no more blushing to be so caught than if they had found him planting garlic.\n\nIt is, I suppose, out of tenderness and respect to the natural modesty of mankind that a great and religious author is of opinion that this act is so necessarily obliged to privacy and shame that he cannot persuade himself there could be any absolute performance in those impudent embraces of the Cynics, but that they contented themselves to represent lascivious gestures only, to maintain the impudence of their school's profession; and that, to eject what shame had withheld and restrained, it was afterward necessary for them to withdraw into the shade. But he had not thoroughly examined their debauches; for Diogenes, playing the beast with himself in public, wished, in the presence of all that saw him, that he could fill his belly by that exercise. To those who asked him why he did not find out a more commodious place to eat in than in the open street, he made answer, \"Because I am hungry in the open street.\" The women philosophers who mixed with their sect, mixed also with their persons, in all places, without reservation; and Hipparchia was not received into Crates's society, but upon condition that she should, in all things, follow the practice and customs of his rule. These philosophers set a great price upon virtue, and renounce all other discipline but the moral; and yet, in all their actions, they attributed the sovereign authority to the election of their sage, and above the laws; and gave no other curb to voluptuousness but moderation only, and the conservation of the liberty of others.\n\nHeraclitus and Protagoras, forasmuch as wine seemed bitter to the sick, and pleasant to the sound, the rudder crooked in the water, and straight when out, and such like contrary appearances as are found in subjects, argued thence that all subjects had, in themselves, the causes of these appearances; and there was some bitterness in the wine which had some sympathy with the sick man's taste, and the rudder some bending quality sympathizing with him that looks upon it in the water; and so of all the rest; which is to say, that all is in all things, and, consequently, nothing in any one; for, where all is, there is nothing.\n\nThis opinion put me in mind of the experience we have that there is no sense or aspect of any thing, whether bitter or sweet, straight or crooked, that the human mind does not find out in the writings it undertakes to tumble over. Into the cleanest, purest, and most perfect words that can possibly be, how many lies and falsities have we suggested! What heresy has not there found ground and testimony sufficient to make itself embraced and defended! 'Tis for this that the authors of such errors will never depart from proof of the testimony of the interpretation of words. A person of dignity, who would approve to me, by authority, the search of the philosopher's stone, wherein he was head over ears engaged, lately alleged to me at least five or six passages of the Bible upon which, he said, he first founded his attempt, for the discharge of his conscience (for he is a divine); and, in truth, the idea was not only pleasant, but, moreover, very well accommodated to the defence of this fine science.\n\nBy this way the reputation of divining fables is acquired. There is no fortune-teller, if we have this authority, but, if a man will take the pains to tumble and toss, and narrowly to peep into all the folds and glosses of his words, he may make him, like the Sibyls, say what he will. There are so many ways of interpretation that it will be hard but that, either obliquely or in a direct line, an ingenious wit will find out, in every subject, some air that will serve for his purpose; therefore we find a cloudy and ambiguous style in so frequent and ancient use. Let the author but make himself master of that, to busy posterity about his predictions, which not only his own parts, but the accidental favour of the matter itself, may do for him; and, as to the rest, express himself, whether after a foolish or a subtle manner, somewhat obscurely or contradictorily, 'tis no matter;\u2014a number of wits, shaking and sifting him, will bring out a great many several forms, either according to his meaning, or collateral, or contrary, to it, which will all redound to his honour; he will see himself enriched by the means of his disciples, like the regents of colleges by their pupils yearly presents. This it is which has given reputation to many things of no worth at all; that has brought several writings in vogue, and given them the fame of containing all sorts of matter can be desired; one and the same thing receiving a thousand and a thousand images and various considerations; nay, as many as we please.\n\nIs it possible that Homer could design to say all that we make him say, and that he designed so many and so various figures, as that the divines, law-givers, captains, philosophers, and all sorts of men who treat of sciences, how variously and opposite soever, should indifferently quote him, and support their arguments by his authority, as the sovereign lord and master of all offices, works, and artisans, and counsellor-general of all enterprises? Whoever has had occasion for oracles and predictions has there found sufficient to serve his turn. 'Tis a wonder how many and how admirable concurrences an intelligent person, and a particular friend of mine, has there found out in favour of our religion; and cannot easily be put out of the conceit that it was Homer's design; and yet he is as well acquainted with this author as any man whatever of his time. And what he has found in favour of our religion there, very many anciently have found in favour of theirs. Do but observe how Plato is tumbled and tossed about; every one ennobling his own opinions by applying him to himself, and making him take what side they please. They draw him in, and engage him in all the new opinions the world receives; and make him, according to the different course of things, differ from himself; every one makes him disavow, according to his own sense, the manners and customs lawful in his age, because they are unlawful in ours; and all this with vivacity and power, according to the force and sprightliness of the wit of the interpreter. From the same foundation that Heraclitus and this sentence of his had, \"that all things had in them those forms that we discern,\" Democritus drew quite a contrary conclusion,\u2014\"that objects have in them nothing that we discern in them;\" and because honey is sweet to one and bitter to another, he thence argued that it was neither sweet nor bitter. The Pyrrhonians would say that they knew not whether it is sweet or bitter, or whether the one or the other, or both; for these always gained the highest point of dubitation. The Cyrenaics held that nothing was perceptible from without, and that that only was perceptible that inwardly touched us, as pain and pleasure; acknowledging neither sound nor colour, but certain affections only that we receive from them; and that man's judgment had no other seat Protagoras believed that \"what seems true to every one, is true to every one.\" The Epicureans lodged all judgment in the senses, and in the knowledge of things, and in pleasure. Plato would have the judgment of truth, and truth itself, derived from opinions and the senses, to belong to the wit and cogitation.\n\nThis discourse has put me upon the consideration of the senses, in which lies the greatest foundation and Prof of our ignorance. Whatsoever is known, is doubtless known by the faculty of the knower; for, seeing the judgment proceeds from the operation of him that judges, 'tis reason that this operation be performed by his means and will, not by the constraint of another; as it would happen if we knew things by the power, and according to the law of their essence. Now all knowledge is conveyed to us by the senses; they are our masters:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Via qua munita fidei\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proxima fert humanum in pectus, templaque mentis;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It is the surest path that faith can find\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By which to enter human heart and mind.\"\nScience begins by them, and is resolved into them. After all, we should know no more than a stone if we did not know there is sound, odour, light, taste, measure, weight, softness, hardness, sharpness, colour, smoothness, breadth, and depth; these are the platforms and principles of the structure of all our knowledge; and, according to some, science is nothing else but sense. He that could make me contradict the senses, would have me by the throat; he could not make me go further back. The senses are the beginning and the end of human knowledge:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Invenies primis ab sensibns esse creatam\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Notitiam veil; neque sensus posse refelli....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Quid majore fide porro, quam sensus, haberi Debet?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Of truth, whate'er discoveries are made,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are by the senses to us first conveyed;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor will one sense be baffled; for on what\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can we rely more safely than on that?\"\nLet us attribute to them the least we can, we must, however, of necessity grant them this, that it is by their means and mediation that all our instruction is directed. Cicero says, that Chrysippus having attempted to extenuate the force and virtue of the senses, presented to himself arguments and so vehement oppositions to the contrary that he could not satisfy himself therein; whereupon Cameades, who maintained the contrary side, boasted that he would make use of the very words and arguments of Chrysippus to controvert and confute him, and therefore thus cried out against him: \"O miserable! thy force has destroyed thee.\" There can be nothing absurd to a greater degree than to maintain that fire does not warm, that light does not shine, and that there is no weight nor solidity in iron, which are things conveyed to us by the senses; neither is there belief nor knowledge in man that can be compared to that for certainty.\n\nThe first consideration I have upon the subject of the senses is that I make a doubt whether or no man be furnished with all natural senses. I see several animals who live an entire and perfect life, some without sight, others without hearing; who knows whether to us also one, two, three, or many other senses may not be wanting? For if any one be wanting, our examination cannot discover the defect. 'Tis the privilege of the senses to be the utmost limit of our discovery; there is nothing beyond them that can assist us in exploration, not so much as one sense in the discovery of another:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   An poterunt oculos aures reprehendere? an aures\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Tactus an hunc porro tactum sapor argnet oris?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An confutabunt nares, oculive revincent?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"Can ears the eyes, the touch the ears, correct?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Or is that touch by tasting to be check'd?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Or th' other senses, shall the nose or eyes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Confute in their peculiar faculties?\"\nThey all make the extremest limits of our ability:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Seorsum cuique potestas Divisa est, sua vis cuique est,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Each has its power distinctly and alone,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And every sense's power is its own.\"\nIt is impossible to make a man naturally blind conceive that he does not see; impossible to make him desire sight, or to regret his defect; for which reason we ought not to derive any assurance from the soul's being contented and satisfied with those we have; considering that it cannot be sensible herein of its infirmity and imperfection, if there be any such thing. It is impossible to say any thing to this blind man, either by reasoning, argument, or similitude, that can possess his imagination with any apprehension of light, colour, or sight; there's nothing remains behind that can push on the senses to evidence. Those that are born blind, whom we hear wish they could see, it is not that they understand what they desire; they have learned from us that they want something; that there is something to be desired that we have, which they can name indeed and speak of its effect and consequences; but yet they know not what it is, nor apprehend it at all.\n\nI have seen a gentleman of a good family who was born blind, or at least blind from such an age that he knows not what sight is; who is so little sensible of his defect that he makes use as we do of words proper for seeing, and applies them after a manner wholly particular and his own. They brought him a child to which he was god-father, which, having taken into his arms, \"Good God,\" said he, \"what a fine child! How beautiful to look upon! what a pretty face it has!\" He will say, like one of us, \"This room has a very fine prospect;\u2014it is clear weather;\u2014the sun shines bright.\" And moreover, being that hunting, tennis, and butts are our exercises, and he has heard so, he has taken a liking to them, will ride a-hunting, and believes he has as good share of the sport as we have; and will express himself as angry or pleased as the best of us all, and yet knows nothing of it but by the ear. One cries out to him, \"Here's a hare!\" when he is upon some even plain where he may safely ride; and afterwards, when they tell him, \"The hare is killed,\" he will be as overjoyed and proud of it as he hears others say they are. He will take a tennis-ball in his left hand and strike it away with the racket; he will shoot with a harquebuss at random, and is contented with what his people tell him, that he is over, or wide.\n\nWho knows whether all human kind commit not the like absurdity, for want of some sense, and that through this default the greatest part of the face of things is concealed from us? What do we know but that the difficulties which we find in several works of nature proceed hence; and that several effects of animals, which exceed our capacity, are not produced by faculty of some sense that we are defective in? and whether some of them have not by this means a life more full and entire than ours? We seize an apple with all our senses; we there find redness, smoothness, odour, and sweetness; but it may have other virtues besides these, as to heat or binding, which no sense of ours can have any reference unto. Is it not likely that there are sensitive faculties in nature that are fit to judge of and to discern those which we call the occult properties in several things, as for the loadstone to attract iron; and that the want of such faculties is the cause that we are ignorant of the true essence of such things? 'Tis perhaps some particular sense that gives cocks to understand what hour it is at midnight, and when it grows to be towards day, and that makes them crow accordingly; that teaches chickens, before they have any experience of the matter, to fear a sparrow-hawk, and not a goose or a peacock, though birds of a much larger size; that cautions them against the hostile quality the cat has against them, and makes them not to fear a dog; to arm themselves against the mewing, a kind of flattering voice, of the one, and not against the barking, a shrill and threatening voice, of the other; that teaches wasps, ants, and rats, to fall upon the best pear and the best cheese before they have tasted them, and inspires the stag, elephant, and serpent, with the knowledge of a certain herb proper for their cure. There is no sense that has not a mighty dominion, and that does not by its power introduce an infinite number of knowledges. If we were defective in the intelligence of sounds, of harmony, and of the voice, it would cause an unimaginable confusion in all the rest of our science; for, besides what belongs to the proper effect of every sense, how many arguments, consequences, and conclusions do we draw to other things, by comparing one sense with another? Let an understanding man imagine human nature originally produced without the sense of seeing, and consider what ignorance and trouble such a defect would bring upon him, what a darkness and blindness in the soul; he will then see by that of how great importance to the knowledge of truth the privation of such another sense, or of two or three, should we be so deprived, would be. We have formed a truth by the consultation and concurrence of our five senses; but perhaps we should have the consent and contribution of eight or ten to make a certain discovery of it in its essence.\n\nThe sects that controvert the knowledge of man do it principally by the uncertainty and weakness of our senses; for since all knowledge is by their means and mediation conveyed unto us, if they fail in their report, if they corrupt or alter what they bring us from without, if the light which by them creeps into the soul be obscured in the passage, we have nothing else to hold by. From this extreme difficulty all these fancies proceed: \"That every subject has in itself all we there find. That it has nothing in it of what we think we there find;\" and that of the Epicureans, \"That the sun is no bigger than 'tis judged by our sight to be:\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Quidquid id est, nihilo fertur majore figura,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quam nostris oculis quam cemimus, esse videtur:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But be it what it will in our esteems,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is no bigger than to us it seems:\"\nthat the appearances which represent a body great to him that is near, and less to him that is more remote, are both true:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nee tamen hic oculos falli concedimus hilum....\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proinde animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yet that the eye's deluded we deny;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charge not the mind's faults, therefore, on the eye:\"\n\"and, resolutely, that there is no deceit in the senses; that we are to lie at their mercy, and seek elsewhere reasons to excuse the difference and contradictions we there find, even to the inventing of lies and other flams, if it come to that, rather than accuse the senses.\" Timagoras vowed that, by pressing or turning his eye, he could never perceive the light of the candle to double, and that the seeming so proceeded from the vice of opinion, and not from the instrument.

He cannot avoid owning that the senses are the sovereign lords of his knowledge; but they are uncertain, and falsifiable in all circumstances; 'tis there that he is to fight it out to the last; and if his just forces fail him, as they do, to supply that defect with obstinacy, temerity, and impudence. In case what the Epicureans say be true, viz: \"that we have no knowledge if the senses' appearances be false;\" and if that also be true which the Stoics say, \"that the appearances of the senses are so false that they can furnish us with no manner of knowledge,\" we shall conclude, to the disadvantage of these two great dogmatical sects, that there is no science at all.\n\nAs to the error and uncertainty of the operation of the senses, every one may furnish himself with as many examples as he pleases; so ordinary are the faults and tricks they put upon us.

I set aside the sense of feeling, that has its functions nearer, more lively, and substantial, that so often, by the effects of the pains it helps the body to, subverts and overthrows all those fine Stoical resolutions, and compels him to cry out of his belly, who has resolutely established this doctrine in his soul\u2014\"That the colic, and all other pains and diseases, are indifferent things, not having the power to abate any thing of the sovereign felicity wherein the wise man is seated by his virtue.\" There is no heart so effeminate that the rattle and sound of our drums and trumpets will not inflame with courage; nor so sullen that the harmony of our music will not rouse and cheer; nor so stubborn a soul that will not feel itself struck with some reverence in considering the gloomy vastness of our churches, the variety of ornaments, and order of our ceremonies; and in hearing the solemn music of our organs, and the grace and devout harmony of our voices. Even those that come in with contempt feel a certain shivering in their hearts, and something of dread that makes them begin to doubt their opinions. For my part I do not think myself strong enough to hear an ode of Horace or Catullus sung by a beautiful young mouth without emotion; and Zeno had reason to say \"that the voice was the flower of beauty.\" One would once make me believe that a certain person, whom all we Frenchmen know, had imposed upon me in repeating some verses that he had made; that they were not the same upon paper that they were in the air; and that my eyes would make a contrary judgment to my ears; so great a power has pronunciation to give fashion and value to works that are left to the efficacy and modulation of the voice. And therefore Philoxenus was not so much to blame, hearing one giving an ill accent to some composition of his, in spurning and breaking certain earthen vessels of his, saying, \"I break what is thine, because thou corruptest what is mine.\" To what end did those men who have, with a firm resolution, destroyed themselves, turn away their faces that they might not see the blow that was by themselves appointed? And that those who, for their health, desire and command incisions to be made, and cauteries to be applied to them, cannot endure the sight of the preparations, instruments, and operations of the surgeon, being that the sight is not in any way to participate in the pain? Are not these proper examples to verify the authority the senses have over the imagination?

Let there be a beam thrown over betwixt these two towers, of breadth sufficient to walk upon, there is no philosophical wisdom so firm that can give us the courage to walk over it as we should do upon the ground. I have often tried this upon our mountains in these parts; and though I am one who am not the most subject to be afraid, I was not able to endure to look into that infinite depth without horror and trembling, though I stood above my length from the edge of the precipice, and could not have fallen unless I would. Where I also observed that, what height soever the precipice was, provided there were some tree, or some jutting out of a rock, a little to support and divide the sight, it a little eases our fears, and gives greater assurance; as if they were things by which in falling we might have some relief; but that direct precipices we are not to look upon without being giddy; Ut despici vine vertigine timid ocvlorum animique non possit: \"'To that one cannot look without dizziness;\" which is a manifest imposture of the sight. And therefore it was that that fine philosopher put out his own eyes, to free the soul from being diverted by them, and that he might philosophize at greater liberty; but, by the same rule, he should have dammed up his ears, that Theophrastus says are the most dangerous instruments about us for receiving violent impressions to alter and disturb us; and, finally, should have deprived himself of all his other senses, that is to say, of his life and being; for they have all the power to command our soul and reason: Fit etiam sope specie qudam, sope vocum gravitate et cantibus, ut pettantur animi vehementius; sope etiam cura et timor, \"For it often falls out that the minds are more vehemently struck by some sight, by the quality and sound of the voice, or by singing; and ofttimes also by grief and fear.\" Physicians hold that there are certain complexions that are agitated by the same sounds and instruments even to fury. I have seen some who could not hear a bone gnawed under the table without impatience; and there is scarce any man who is not disturbed at the sharp and shrill noise that the file makes in grating upon the iron; as also to hear chewing near them, or to hear any one speak who has an impediment in the throat or nose, will move some people even to anger and hatred. Of what use was that piping prompter of Gracchus, who softened, raised, and moved his master's voice whilst he declaimed at Rome, if the movements and quality of the sound had not the power to move and alter the judgments of the auditory? In earnest, there is wonderful reason to keep such a clutter about the firmness of this fine piece, that suffers itself to be turned and twined by the motion and accidents of so light a wind.\n\nThe same cheat that the senses put upon our understanding they have in turn put upon them; the soul also some times has its revenge; they lie and contend which should most deceive one another.

And so both the inside and the outside of man is full of infirmity and falsehood.\n\nThey who have compared our lives to a dream were, perhaps, more in the right than they were aware of. When we dream, the soul lives, works, and exercises all its faculties, neither more nor less than when awake; but more largely and obscurely, yet not so much, neither, that the difference should be as great as betwixt night and the meridian brightness of the sun, but as betwixt night and shade; there she sleeps, here she slumbers; but, whether more or less, 'tis still dark, and Cimmerian darkness. We wake sleeping, and sleep waking. I do not see so clearly in my sleep; but as to my being awake, I never found it clear enough and free from clouds; moreover, sleep, when it is profound, sometimes rocks even dreams themselves asleep; but our waking is never so sprightly that it rightly purges and dissipates those whimsies, which are waking dreams, and worse than dreams. Our reason and soul receiving those fancies and opinions that come in dreams, and authorizing the actions of our dreams with the like approbation that they do those of the day, wherefore do we not doubt whether our thought, our action, is not another sort of dreaming, and our waking a certain kind of sleep?\n\nIf the senses be our first judges, it is not ours that we are alone to consult; for, in this faculty, beasts have as great, or greater, than we; it is certain that some of them have the sense of hearing more quick than man; others that of seeing, others that of feeling, others that of touch and taste. Democritus said, that the gods and brutes had the sensitive faculties more perfect than man. But betwixt the effects of their senses and ours the difference is extreme.

Which shall be truly poison, the man or the fish? Which shall we believe, the fish of the man, or the man of the fish? One quality of the air infects a man, that does the ox no harm; some other infects the ox, but hurts not the man. Which of the two shall, in truth and nature, be the pestilent quality?

What do we know but that these humours, which thus alter the operations of sight, predominate in beasts, and are usual with them? for we see some whose eyes are yellow, like us who have the jaundice; and others of a bloody colour; 'tis likely that the colours of objects seem other to them than to us. Which of the two shall make a right judgment? for it is not said that the essence of things has a relation to man only; hardness, whiteness, depth, and sharpness, have reference to the service and knowledge of animals as well as to us, and nature has equally designed them for their use. When we press down the eye, the body that we look upon we perceive to be longer and more extended;\u2014many beasts have their eyes so pressed down; this length, therefore, is perhaps the true form of that body, and not that which our eyes give it in the usual state.

A child, by the ordinary rule of nature, hears, sees, and talks otherwise than a man of thirty years old; and he than one of threescore. The senses are, in some, more obscure and dusky, and more open and quick in others. We receive things variously, according as we are, and according as they appear to us. Those rings which are cut out in the form of feathers, which are called endless feathers, no eye can discern their size, or can keep itself from the deception that on one side they enlarge, and on the other contract, and come So a point, even when the ring is being turned round the finger; yet, when you feel them, they seem all of an equal size. Now, our perception being so uncertain and so controverted, it is no more a wonder if we are told that we may declare that snow appears white to us; but that to affirm that it is in its own essence really so is more than we are able to justify; and, this foundation being shaken, all the knowledge in the world must of necessity fall to ruin. What! do our senses themselves hinder one another? A picture seems raised and embossed to the sight; in the handling it seems flat to the touch. Shall we say that musk, which delights the smell, and is offensive to the taste, is agreeable or no? There are herbs and unguents proper for one part o the body, that are hurtful to another; honey is pleasant to the taste, but offensive to the sight. They who, to assist their lust, used in ancient times to make use of magnifying-glasses to represent the members they were to employ bigger, by that ocular tumidity to please themselves the more; to which of their senses did they give the prize,\u2014whether to the sight, that represented the members as large and great as they would desire, or to the feeling, which represented them little and contemptible? Are they our senses that supply the subject with these different conditions, and have the subjects themselves, nevertheless, but one? As we see in the bread we eat, it is nothing but bread, but, by being eaten, it becomes bones, blood, flesh, hair; and nails:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ut cibus in membra atque artus cum diditur omnes,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Disperit,, atque aliam naturam sufficit ex se;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As meats, diffus'd through all the members, lose\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Their former state, and different things compose;\"\nthe humidity sucked up by the root of a tree becomes trunk, leaf, and fruit; and the air, being but one, is modulated, in a trumpet, to a thousand sorts of sounds; are they our senses, I would fain know, that, in like manner, form these subjects into so many divers qualities, or have they them really such in themselves? And upon this doubt what can we determine of their true essence? Moreover, since the accidents of disease, of raving, or sleep, make things appear otherwise to us than they do to the healthful, the wise, and those that are awake, is it not likely that our right posture of health and understanding, and our natural humours, have, also, wherewith to give a being to things that have a relation to their own condition, and accommodate them to themselves, as well as when they are disordered;\u2014that health is as capable of giving them an aspect as sickness? Why has not the temperate a certain form of objects relative to it, as well as the intemperate? and why may it not as well stamp it with its own character as the other? He whose mouth is out of taste, says the wine is flat; the healthful man commends its flavour, and the thirsty its briskness. Now, our condition always accommodating things to itself, and transforming them according to its own posture, we cannot know what things truly are in themselves, seeing that nothing comes to us but what is falsified and altered by the senses. Where the compass, the square, and the rule, are crooked, all propositions drawn thence, and all buildings erected by those guides, must, of necessity, be also defective; the uncertainty of our senses renders every thing uncertain that they produce:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Denique ut in fabric, si prava est rgula prima,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Et libella aliqu si ex parte claudicat hilum;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Omnia mendose fieri, atque obstipa necessum est,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prava, cubantia, prona, supina, atque absona tecta;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jam ruere ut qudam videantux'velle, ruantque\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prodita judiciis fallacibus omnia primis;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sic igitur ratio tibi reram prava necesse est,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Falsaque sit, falsis qucunque ab sensibus orta est.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But lastly, as in building, if the line\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be not exact and straight, the rule decline,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or level false, how vain is the design!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Uneven, an ill-shap'd and tottering wall\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Must rise; this part must sink, that part must fall,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the rules were false that fashion'd all;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus reason's rules are false if all commence\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And rise from failing and from erring sense.\"\nAs to what remains, who can be fit to judge of and to determine those differences? As we say in controversies of religion that we must have a judge neither inclining to the one side nor the other, free from all choice and affection, which cannot be amongst Christians, just so it falls out in this; for if he be old he cannot judge of the sense of old age, being himself a party in the case; if young, there is the same exception; if healthful, sick, asleep, or awake, he is still the same incompetent judge. We must have some one exempt from all these propositions, as of things indifferent to him; and by this rule we must have a judge that never was.\n\nTo judge of the appearances that we receive of subjects, we ought t have a deciding instrument; to verify this instrument we must have demonstration; to verify this demonstration an instrument; and here we are round again upon the wheel, and no further advanced. Seeing the senses cannot determine our dispute, being full of uncertainty themselves, it must then be reason that must do it; but no reason can be erected upon any other foundation than that of another reason; and so we run back to all infinity. Our fancy does not apply itself to things that are strange, but is conceived by the mediation of the senses; and the senses do not comprehend a foreign subject, but only their own passions; by which means fancy and appearance are no part of the subject, but only of the passion and sufferance of sense; which passion and subject are different things; wherefore whoever judges by appearances judges by another thing than the subject. And to say that the passions of the senses convey to the soul the quality of foreign subjects by resemblance, how can the soul and understanding be assured of this resemblance, having of itself no commerce with foreign subjects? As they who never knew Socrates cannot, when they see his picture, say it is like him. Now, whoever would, notwithstanding, judge by appearances, if it be by all, it is impossible, because they hinder one another by their contrarieties and discrepancies, as we by experience see: shall some select appearances govern the rest? you must verify this select by another select, the second by a third, and thus there will never be any end to it. Finally, there is no constant existence, neither of the objects' being nor our own; both we, and our judgments, and all mortal things, are evermore incessantly running and rolling; and consequently nothing certain can be established from the one to the other, both the judging and the judged being in a continual motion and mutation.\n\nWe have no communication with being, by reason that all human nature is always in the middle, betwixt being bom and dying, giving but an obscure appearance and shadow, a weak and uncertain opinion of itself; and if, perhaps, you fix your thought to apprehend your being, it would be but like grasping water; for the more you clutch your hand to squeeze and hold what is in its own nature flowing, so much more you lose of what you would grasp and hold. So, seeing that all things are subject to pass from one change to another, reason, that there looks for a real substance, finds itself deceived, not being able to apprehend any thing that is subsistent and permanent, because that every thing is either entering into being, and is not yet arrived at it, or begins to die before it is bom. Plato said, that bodies had never any existence, but only birth; conceiving that Homer had made the Ocean and Thetis father and mother of the gods, to show us that all things are in a perpetual fluctuation, motion, and variation; the opinion of all the philosophers, as he says, before his time, Parmenides only excepted, who would not allow things to have motion, on the power whereof he sets a mighty value. Pythagoras was of opinion that all matter was flowing and unstable; the Stoics, that there is no time present, and that what we call so is nothing but the juncture and meeting of the future and the past; Heraclitus, that never any man entered twice into the same river; Epichar-mus, that he who borrowed money but an hour ago does not owe it now; and that he who was invited over-night to come the next day to dinner comes nevertheless uninvited, considering that they are no more the same men, but are become others; and that there could not a mortal substance be found twice in the same condition; for, by the suddenness and quickness of the change, it one while disperses, and another reunites; it comes and goes after such a manner that what begins to be born never arrives to the perfection of being, forasmuch as that birth is never finished and never stays, as being at an end, but from the seed is evermore changing and shifting one to another; as human seed is first in the mother's womb made a formless embryo, after delivered thence a sucking infant, afterwards it becomes a boy, then a youth, then a man, and at last a decrepit old man; so that age and subsequent generation is always destroying and spoiling that which went before:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mutt enira mundi naturam totius tas,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ex alioque alius status excipere omnia debet;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nec manet ulla sui similis res; omnia migrant,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Omnia commutt natura, et vertere cogit.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"For time the nature of the world translates,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And from preceding gives all things new states;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nought like itself remains, but all do range,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And nature forces every thing to change.\"\n\"And yet we foolishly fear one kind of death, whereas we have already passed, and do daily pass, so many others; for not only, as Heraclitus said, the death of fire is generation of air, and the death of air generation of water; but, moreover, we may more manifestly discern it in ourselves; manhood dies, and passes away when age comes on; and youth is terminated in the flower of age of a full-grown man, infancy in youth, and the first age dies in infancy; yesterday died in to-day, and to-day will die in to-morrow; and there is nothing that remains in the same state, or that is always the same thing. And that it is so let this be the proof; if we are always one and the same, how comes it to pass that we are now pleased with one thing, and by and by with another? How comes it to pass that we love or hate contrary things, that we praise or condemn them? How comes it to pass that we have different affections, and no more retain the same sentiment in the same thought? For it is not likely that without mutation we should assume other passions; and, that which suffers mutation does not remain the same, and if it be not the same it is not at all; but the same that the being is does, like it, unknowingly change and alter; becoming evermore another from another thing; and consequently the natural senses abuse and deceive themselves, taking that which seems for that which is, for want of well knowing what that which is, is. But what is it then that truly is? That which is eternal; that is to say, that never had beginning, nor never shall have ending, and to which time can bring no mutation. For time is a mobile thine, and that appears as in a shadow, with a matter evermore flowing and running, without ever remaining stable and permanent; and to which belong those words, before and after, has been, or shall be: which at the first sight, evidently show that it is not a thing that is; for it were a great folly, and a manifest falsity, to say that that is which is not et being, or that has already ceased to be. And as to these words, present, instant, and now, by which it seems that we principally support and found the intelligence of time, reason, discovering, does presently destroy it; for it immediately divides and splits it into the future and past, being of necessity to consider it divided in two. The same happens to nature, that is measured, as to time that measures it; for she has nothing more subsisting and permanent than the other, but all things are either born, bearing, or dying. So that it were sinful to say of God, who is he only who is, that he was, or that he shall be ; for those are terms of declension, transmutation, and vicissitude, of what cannot continue or remain in being; wherefore we are to conclude that God alone is, not according to any measure of time, but according to an immutable and an immovable eternity, not measured by time, nor subject to any declension; before whom nothing was, and after whom nothing shall be, either more new or more recent, but a real being, that with one sole now fills the for ever, and that there is nothing that truly is but he alone; without our being able to say, he has been, or shall be; without beginning, and without end.\" To this so religious conclusion of a pagan I shall only add this testimony of one of the same condition, for the close of this long and tedious discourse, which would furnish me with endless matter: \"What a vile and abject thing,\" says he, \"is man, if he do not raise himself above humanity!\" 'Tis a good word and a profitable desire, but withal absurd; for to make the handle bigger than the hand, the cubic longer than the arm, and to hope to stride further than our legs can reach, is both impossible and monstrous; or that man should rise above himself and humanity; for he cannot see but with his eyes, nor seize but with his hold. He shall be exalted, if God will lend him an extraordinary hand; he shall exalt himself, by abandoning and renouncing his own proper means, and by suffering himself to be raised and elevated by means purely celestial. It belongs to our Christian faith, and not to the stoical virtue, to pretend to that divine and miraculous metamorphosis.1Embed"}, {"name": "Holy Ground", "artist": "Taylor Swift", "lyrics":

Appreciate a little help on the guitar, all right?\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, my daddy left home when I was three\nAnd he didn't leave much to ma and me\nJust this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze\nNow, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid\nBut the meanest thing that he ever did\nWas before he left, he went and named me \"Sue\"\n[Verse 2]\nWell, he must've thought that it was quite a joke\nAnd it got a lot of laughs from a lots of folks\nIt seems I had to fight my whole life through\nSome gal would giggle and I'd get red\nAnd some guy'd laugh then I'd bust his head\nI tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named \"Sue\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, I grew up quick and I grew up mean\nMy fists got hard and my wits got keen\nRoamed from town to town to hide my shame\nBut I made me a vow to the moon and stars\nI'd search the honky-tonks and bars\nAnd kill the man who gave me that awful name\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July\nAnd I just hit town and my throat was dry\nI thought I'd stop and have myself a brew\nAt an old saloon on a street of mud\nThere at a table, dealing stud\nSat the dirty, mangy dog that named me \"Sue\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nWell, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad\nFrom a worn-out picture that my mother'd had\nAnd I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye\nHe was big and bent and gray and old\nAnd I looked at him and my blood ran cold\nAnd I said, \"My name is Sue! How do you do?\nNow you're going to die!\"\nYeah, that's what I told him!\nYou might also like[Verse 6]\nWell, I hit him hard right between the eyes\nAnd he went down, but to my surprise\nHe come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear\nBut I busted a chair right across his teeth\nAnd we crashed through the wall and into the street\nKicking and a-gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer\n\n[Verse 7]\nI tell you, I've fought tougher men\nBut I really can't remember when\nHe kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile\nI heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss\nAnd he went for his gun and I pulled mine first\nHe stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile\n\n[Verse 8]\nAnd he said, \"Son, this world is rough\nAnd if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough\nAnd I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along\nSo I give you that name and I said goodbye\nI knew you'd have to get tough or die\nAnd it's that name that helped to make you strong\"\nYeah\n\n[Verse 9]\nHe said, \"Now you just fought one hell of a fight\nAnd I know you hate me, and you got the right\nTo kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do\nBut you ought to thank me, before I die\nFor the gravel in your guts and the spit in your eye\nBecause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue\"\n[Verse 10]\nI got all choked up and I threw down my gun\nAnd I called him my pa, and he called me his son\nAnd I came away with a different point of view\nAnd I think about him, now and then\nEvery time I try and every time I win\nAnd if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him\nBill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!10Embed"}, {"name": "Would You Go with Me", "artist": "Josh Turner", "lyrics": "Would You Go With Me Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWould you go with me if we rolled down streets of

and I couldn't help but sing along\nBecause every time I hear that song\n\n[Chorus]\nI go back to a two toned short bed Chevy\nDriving my first love out to the levee\nLiving life with no sense of time\nAnd I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line\nA blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine\nWishing time would stop right in its tracks\nEvery time I hear that song, I go back\nI go back\n[Verse 2]\nI used to rock all night long to \"Keep On Rocking Me Baby\"\nFrat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies\nWell I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along\nBecause every time I hear that song\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I go back to the smell of an old gym floor\nAnd the taste of salt on a Carolina shore\nAfter graduation and drinking goodbye to friends\nAnd I go back to watchin summer fade to fall\nGrowin up too fast and I do recall\nWishin time would stop right in its tracks\nEverytime I hear that song, I go back\nI go back\n\n[Bridge]\nWe all have a song that somehow stamped our lives\nTakes us to another place and time\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir\nSinging bout God, brimstone, and fire\nAnd the smell of Sunday chicken after church\nAnd I go back to the loss of a real good friend\nAnd the sixteen summers I shared with him\nNow \"Only The Good Die Young\" stops me in my tracks\nEvery time I hear that song\nI go back\nSee

the very next day when I punched in\nWith my big lunchbox, and with help from my friend\nI left that day with a lunchbox full of gears\nI've never considered myself a thief\nBut GM wouldn't miss just one little piece\nEspecially if I strung it out over several years\nThe first day I got me a fuel pump\nAnd the next day I got me an engine and a trunk\nThen I got me a transmission and all of the chrome\nThe little things I could get in my big lunchbox\nLike nuts, and bolts, and all four shocks\nBut the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home\nNow, up to now my plan went all right\nUntil we tried to put it all together one night\nAnd that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong\nThe transmission was a '53\nAnd the motor turned out to be a '73\nAnd when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone\nSo we drilled it out so that it would fit\nAnd with a little bit of help from an a-daptor kit\nWe had that engine running just like a song\nNow the headlights, they was another sight\nWe had two on the left and one on the right\nBut when we pulled out the switch all three of them come on\nThe back end looked kind of funny too\nBut we put it together and when we got through\nWell, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin\nAbout that time my wife walked out\nAnd I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts\nBut she opened the door and said \"Honey, take me for a spin\"\nSo we drove up town just to get the tags\nAnd I headed her right on down main drag\nI could hear everybody laughing for blocks around\nBut up there at the courthouse they didn't laugh\nBecause to type it up it took the whole staff\nAnd when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI got it one piece at a

down\n(Hold my body down)\nThere ain't no grave\nCan hold my body down\n(When I hear that trumpet sound)\nThere ain't no grave\nCan hold my body down\n(I'm gonna rise right out of the ground)\nVerse 3:\nNow it's time to speak life to the people who will listen\nPut my money where my mouth is that's why Cash is in the rhythm\nAdonai can save from the darkest nights of the soul\n'Cuz in this game of life you have to give Master control\n\nThere ain't no addiction that I know you cannot conquer\nAlcohol, drugs, porn I know my God is stronger\nRestoring the families the enemy tried breaking\nYou can lift your head child because of grace amazing\n\nAnd there ain't no sickness my Father cannot cure\nFrom mental depression to Cancer, I'm sure\nI'm a witness to his power so I could never deny it\nIt only takes a leap of faith and I dare you to try\n\nPut your faith in Messiah who walked through the fire and paid the cost\nThe man who took on the devil and danced with death, never lost\nSo place your trust in the Son and cling on to his name\nAin't no grave held the Savior and for you, it's the same\n\nHook: Johnny Cash\nThere ain't no grave can hold my body down\nThere ain't no grave can hold my body down\nThere ain't no grave can hold my body down\nThere ain't no grave can hold my body downEmbed"}, {"name": "Pay No Mind (Snoozer)", "artist": "Beck", "lyrics": "Pay No Mind

No\nBut I'm better than you\nNot as a battler, listen, I'ma say this\nNot necessarily not as a battler, but as a person, that's what the evidence proves\nWhen I present it to you\nYou might pretend it's a ruse\nAnd I intend to confuse\nYou know what they say about those treacherous Jews\nI have a question for you\nSaw you vs Iron\nShit's brilliant\nBut now that this Jew got next, tell me\nHow many Jew jokes have you got left?\nHold on, let me guess; six million?\nBut let me get back, to reflectin' and building on all that it happened\nSince I left the field like I was Dr. Manhattan\nI was living off of my rapping\n'till I tied the knot, then I got into a tighter spot\nThen I had to find a job\nBut\nWait, sorry fuck\nSo Diz', a job is a place where you go to make money\nLike an office or store\nYou ever seen The Office before?\nIt's like that, but less funny\nAnd then you get a check\nYou can spend it on your food and ya rent\nFuck, I'm doing it again\nSo Diz', rent...\nI'll take it slow\nSee rent is this thing where you know find a place, and you pay money to stay monthly\nSee, I ain't know if you're aware of it, because you ain't left your parents till your fuckin' late 20s\nSo according to you, right, on Twitter you called me a \"manchild\"\nThe audacity!\nThat you, mister level headed adult\nYOU called me a \"manchild\" that is damn wild\nYou were living with your mom and dad while\nI was in my own crib, diggin' up dirt on QP for that damn file\nBack to that Iron battle, you know I gotta say\nThe angle about Jews not going to work on 9/11, kinda clever\nExcept you didn't go to work on 9-- ever\nSee down the line I went through shit\nMy crew split\nAs too did my creative drive, my will to stay alive took a huge dip\nAnd my momma got too sick\nDown to a toothpick\nAnd I stopped makin' music\nSee the sad thing is Diz, you said I tried and I flopped\nNah, it was going fine, then I stopped\nIt was painful, truly\nSee, I know it sounds sad, but Soul is still a Joker though\nI ain't talking about the Gotham kind\nTalking like Persona 5\nThat is what I was personified\nCause I lost track of all the kind of monsters I had caught inside\nEspecially the one whisperin' to me that I oughta die\nSo bottom line, there is nothing you can say to me\nThat is more evil than the shit I used to tell myself all the time\nI got out that coma I been frozen lately\nI gotta thanks all the homies that could motivate me\nEven though the road was shaky\nLike the way Dizaster's parents thought it was okay to hold a baby\nSo now y'all here to see my return to the format\nYou here to be my personal doormat\nHold up\nBefore we go all that\nDo battle rappers still say dumb shit like \"you catch a shell, then you sleep like Squirtle and Snorlax\"?\nNo, good\nWell ignore that, fantastic\nYou know, I respect you Diz, because you're willing to give someone the shirt off your back\nEven when they didn't need it, or were asking you for that\nHe takes his shirt off all the time\nAnd I know you like to make fun of the way I make apologies\nLot of liberals are faker than astrology\nI'm not a liberal, I'm a leftist, and the difference is tremendous\nAnd there's one thing I have to say, it's gotta be legit\nI am sorry, for every bomb that Israel has ever launched at Lebanon\nThey always got a reason and each of them is fucking extra wrong\nThe IDF level houses, you know, bring fiery death on thousands\nMaybe someone you knew\nNah I ain't pushing no button, but, Israeli government always said they do it in the name of the Jews\nThis ain't a angle or a gimmick, fuck the haters and the cynics\nBut I refuse to accept that any Jew is protected by doing something so fuckin' hateful to you\nOn top of all that\nAnd all the while, the West Bank has gotten terrorized\nEvery day in Gaza's genocide\nAnd America could end it by threatening to ends its ties\nBut they just always defend it\nAnd the Palestinians get left to die\nAt this point, Diz probably thinkin'\nThis ain't therapy\nDiz, that ain't fair to me\nBecause I gotta grapple in my disgrace\nAnd my old battles are like your face, they've aged terribly\nAnd to everybody, to all you who suggested; \"No SJW stuff\"\nI've reviewed your request, and, shut the fuck up!\nI know they hate it when I do this, but sorry, I'm accountable\nSo, I am sorry if I have hurt anyone who was marginalized with the words that I'd use\nEspecially cause it doesn't reflect my personal views\nI fucked up so much\nAnd that's being accountable\nBeing a fuckin' shithead is not a fuckin' alpha move\nAnd it's like fuckin', and I'm not talkin' about like some light politeness like not talking when ya mouth is full\n[Dizaster] I'm the only one reacting\n\n[Soul Khan]\nAnd that's why it's the best line\nSee what you refer to as political correctness is just giving some respect for a minute or a second, it's forethought\nAnd if you dismiss and reject it\nCause you think it's makes you different or you're edgy\nYou're not\nSo, what to do?\nDiz, what are your preferred gender pronouns?\nUsually say like he, him, his, whatever\nSo mine are he, him, his\nLook at how easy that it is\nIt only takes fuckin' two seconds\nBut all these anti PC motherfuckers will complain for hours about it\nAnd how PC it is\nSo let me make the math\nThere are more than two genders, your eyebrows look like two sweaters\nDisgustingly huge pairs, fuck tweezers, use Nair\nI bet the effort it takes to groom is tremendous\nIf you have one square up there, you'd win at Tetris\nI mean this in the kindest way\nSo what happened?\nEverything that happened after Math, I have to ask\nShould I be scared of you?\nOr do you only attack me if I dare you to?\nDiz, Diz, c'mon man, are you, wait a second\nAm I getting this right\nWill you do anything to anybody dares you to?\nAre you sure?\nChallenge accepted\nToo bad\nConsent negative, my bad\nAlright so, JK, you can't be that, don't do that, always say that\nAnyway so, challenge accepted\nDiz...I dare you to kiss me\nI mean my man\nI ain't pausin' shit, I ain't pausin' shit\nIn 2019, we past pausin'\nHold up, hold up\nCan anyone else do this shit\nIt ain't scary or risky\nGo back to the hotel, share some whisky\nMy girl's okay with it\nC'mon tough guy, you gon' kiss me or not?\nC'mon! No!\nYou gon' kiss me\nHold on, this the important part\nC'mon tough guy, you gon' kiss me or not?\nPut Your Money Where Your Mouth Iz, King of the Dot!\nYou might also like[Dizaster]\nThis was his plan to defuse all my shit.

No, this shit is new\nI remember the old days, when your hair used to be\nYou would see\nIn a park full of skaters\nSo many spikes it was like your barber was playing a game of Mario Maker\nIf you wanna use Sega\nYour coif is a mess dawg\nOut there looking like Islamic the Hedgehog\nWait a second though, I'm sensitive to this shit\nIs that offensive to y'all, or the, you watching at home\nCause I felt it was like borderline\nSorta like when Madness called me Jew-Pac Shalom\nWhich is funny-\nDiz, my friend is\nIs it offensive to you Diz?\nMight be a reason to pretend that it is\nWe both know a secret\nYou oughta know\nLet me take you back\nI recently remembered\nWhen you and I were at Club Excess\nIn a pit like this\nDoin' shit like this\nAnd\nDiz was saying, this and that, I wasn't listening\nYou know what Diz is like?\nIt's a thing\nThing, the moment that burned in my memory\nIs when he turned and he said to me\nYo bro, it's funny, I ain't exactly Muslim shit\nAnd I was like, what? good lord!\nDiz, are you telling us?\nThat through your entire battling career, and you've been battling for years, a third of your life, earning your stripes\nYou led us to believe that you're Muslim, and this whole motherfucking time\nYou never actually said one\nYou not exactly, I never was gonna say that\nSee he says, I never said I was a Muslim\nBut you say it in the battles, not the interviews\nBut every time the interviewer calls you Muslim, you never correct or interrupt him\nThat's disgusting\nDon't play, I ain't a bit amused\nCause--\n[Dizaster]\nI'm an offshoot of Islam, that's why\n\n[Soul Khan]\nNhhh, yeah that's debatable\nBut relatable\nSo\nWell no I'm talking in your relation on what you do\nYou misrepresent yourself to your fans and to your opponents\nI want them to take themselves back to the moments\nAnd the raps that you told em\nUsing cultural standings that ain't actually holding\nAre you of the mind that just because racist thinks all Arabs are in terror groups\nThat that makes it fair for you\nTo uphold the stereotypes of terror too?\nWhat about Muslims who aren't Arab, dude?\nYou don't know think South Asians and African Muslims get hassled at customs?\nOr that their women in hijabs and burkas are afraid of getting shot and murdered\nDue to the rise in fucking Islamic, anti-Islamic fervor?\nSo he has a rebuttal\nI'm sure that shit is subtle\nYou know a lot of the old Jewish lines I had were fucking foolish\nBut the difference between that and you is\nI'm actually fucking Jewish\nLike, this here, was his decision\nAnd now we in this position\nYou hate the cultures vultures, what are you, a religion pigeon?\nI mean obviously\nYou're Arab, so you know the language and the basic protocol\nBut you faking overall\nI guess Dizaster is just Arabic for Rachel Dolezal\nEither way, you lied so these people have no reason to even slightly believe you\nOr\nI have just freed you\nTo finally be you\nDiz, do you hear this\nDo you recognize the scheme\nSee where I'm trying to lead you\nIt's Soul Khan, from the last tribe of the Hebrews\nListen Diz, you can admit it\nHonestly, you don't wanna do it out loud\nAnd that's just too much to ask though\nThat's fine\nIf you're not Muslim, just stand here, looking like the world's stupidest asshole\nOh damnit, I'm so proud of you\nThat probably took a lot of you\nRight?\nHonestly\nI don't wanna do anything more on this verse\nBut if this contest of a honor, pride and our worth\nIt's just a motherfucking homicide in the first\nBut, if that ain't enough\nYou just get to serve me\nI don't give a fuck\nCause in 2021, your president is Bernie\n(Diz: you done?)\nI could be, hold on\nI like you just wobbling back and forth\n(Diz: c'mon pull something out, c'mon rebuttal something)\nNo, I don't want to right now\nJust looking at you like, sorta like, wobbling, yeah go Diz, it's your turn\n\n[Round 1: Dizaster]\nOh it's my turn?\nY'all ready for some shit?!\nWhat the fuck was that?\nWhat the fuck was that?\nAy trust me, we gon get to the Muslim in round 3, but right now\nWoo!\nWe gotta address fucking MC Dry Milk\nThis ain't a battle, this a race to see which one of us gon' be the first to get this guy killed\nMe, or his white guilt\nFucking Soul Khan\nI'm not the person to step to\nYeah, we gon' start off with this because honestly, I'm not here to psychologically test you\nI'm here to open up a door, for everybody to get through\nJust like a West Hollywood rest room\nIf I get mad today, I'mma just say \"F you\"\nInstead of wishing death on you, I'ma just wish I never met you\nHe wants to gender stuff, we can all be men, women too, c'mon\nEven though y'all don't believe it, a lot of y'all like to pretend to\nJust like your mom did to fulfill the role of your pops when he left you\nLeft you, without a dope beat to step to\nStep one: this a battle, I ain't gotta respect you\nStep two: you only here cause the rent's due\nYour bitch left you\nAnd the music not bringing the checks through\nStep three: he couldn't make a return unless he\nWent against me\nThe leader of the LGBT\nGoing against a

kidding me?\nYou said you quit battle rap, what you back here using us for?\nYou said you wouldn't return till you had a Grammy\nYou think we forgot the stupid shit you used to say and do from before\nYou said you was done with this game, you gon make go music and hit the booth and record\nI guess it's safe to say he's back with the Canadians since America couldn't give this Jew no award (Juno Award)\nHold on, hold on\nHow long you gonna fucking hold on for?\nIt's been 9 years of you holdin' on\nRecording songs\nWe thought you would blow up by now man, what's going on?\nWhy have you not got put on?\nI thought you'd have some soul hits by now, but you don't\nWhat a shocker, Khan (Chaka Khan)\nI thought Brown Bag was growin' strong\nBut now you trying to weasel your way in with us

directions, you like a child outside tryin' to find a Pok\u00e9mon\nAnd this is how all these silver spoon posers are\nThe moment they don't get what they want, that's the moment they gone\nAnd I

rupture like there was busted waterpipe of lead\nGushing by your head\nGet your onion diced, I'll oven fry your egg\nCut and slice your chest\nOpen up ya eye with it\nLeave it stuck inside your neck\nAnd watch the whole other side go dead like the Butterfly Effect\nThey put a butter knife against a butterfly knife\nThis is the different between cookie cutter rhymes and someone who designs

I'm actually blind.\"\nAnd this is how he was actin' when he was back in his prime\nI want you guys to try to imagine what he would've acted like if he actually got signed\n\"I'm Soul Khan and all you MC's are peasants!\"\nLet that sink in for a second\nAnd tell me this dude here is on my level\nWhen he hasn't even shown y'all enough love or wrote enough history\nAnd I still say this to little bro respectfully\nA two year stretch is like Bill Bellemy, that's a joke of a legacy\nSo whether he, do or don't have any respect for me\nIn the end, I'm still considered the legend on every top ten you see\nIf you even say the word \"battle rap\" my resume alone will force you to mention me\nI'm memorable because of my work ethic, of course they remember me\nThe respect we have for you is only present because we as a culture selfishly kept you alive in our collective memories\nBecause besides that you haven't done anything\nYou're prevalent cause we make your relevant and that's a closed case and a no brainer like JF Kennedy\nI'll bet you a dead president half of these people forgot your name\nBut for our sake, for our sake\n\n{Soul Khan starts laughing}\n\nOh don't laugh, cause yeah, it's okay\nThey probably forgot your name\nBut we still gotta give you a little star on battle rap's Walk Of Fame\nJust not on Hollywood Boulevard, yours would be laid down on Memory Lane\nAnd that's the realest shit anybody's ever wrote about you\nCause you wanna be this voice for the people but your body of work don't add up to what you socially amount to\nI got my crown jewels cause I show and prove strictly off ground moves\nWhile you got a status quo that exists merely cause the people around you\nSubjectively gave it it's value\nDon't you get it? Without us, you don't have you\nAnd without me, they don't have views\nSo without this battle the fans lose\nAnd if you ever question who I am to this scene, I'm everything bitch, THAT'S WHO!\nAnd you the little jokey jokey kid, who only poses a risk (wrist) when he poses like this\nUh oh, I think he's forming a flip\nHe's about to channel the inner Charron from his dick\nHe makes jokes about himself cause that's his only defense\nBut what kind of lack of testosterone is this?\nHe's gon' become some kind of leftist Hollywood director\nI can see it now, workin' on his own little script\nRelaunching new episodes: Soul Khan Presents: Zena The Warrior Prince\nThis guy went from a full blown chauvinist to an emotional bitch\nLook I understand that you regret being so homophobic but you need to get over it quick\nDon't be like Jussie Smollett now and beat yourself up over this shit\nBecause of course you're not homophobic bro, we know that\nCause you're really gay in secret\nLast time you passed out at a frat house they drew a dick on your forehead while you were sleepin'\nAnd the first thing you said when you woke up and peeped it\nWas...\"I'ma keep it.\"\nSo that's all you had? The little homophobic kiss me angle you was gonna come back with?\n\n[Soul Khan] The offer still stands\n\n[Dizaster]\nTo cover up the fact that you were consistently callin' people \"homo\" as one of your habits\nYou wanna know something bro? You know what's really gay?\nWhen they asked you if you had love for battle rap still and you answered back with, \"I don't know if I've ever had it.\"\nSoul Khan in our world, that's the definition of a {beep}\nOf course he gets no passes\nIf he recycles he should be judged like all the MC's\nHe said, \"Oh, I don't know if I can catch up on these battles to know if I'm reusing a bar or a scheme.\"\nBut that's the point dummy, it's pretty much a logical thing\nYou wouldn't have to watch 1,000,000 battles in a row if you actively cared enough to still be a part of the scene\nBut, you wouldn't have to catch up if you were here\nThat's what makes you a foreigner but what does all of this mean?\nIt means you failed as a battle rapper and you failed to go mainstream\nSo now you this lost underground backpacker that's caught in-between\nWanting to make bars or do a song where you sing\nSo Soul Khan you'll always be a man of many Willy Wonka hats but you'll never be the boss of one thing\nSo tell me, what you planning to do with all this you self deprecating Jew apologist?\nI know you're reformed now but to me you're every \"isist\" and \"ologist\" there probably is\nYou made a living off of calling people \"fruit balls\"\nYou're basically a RuPaul-ogist\nAll these things make it all too obvious\nKhan is a true Communist\nBut this is Americana, and what Khan insists on don't make no kinda sense\nWe on some reconnaissance\nYou know who my gang is Khan, don't make me Genghis Khan your shit\nDeath by a thousand cuts, I'll leave him with all kinds of body slits\nWhen the Katina leaves cuts in him deep as the Mariana Trench\nI'm fast as Mayweather, you may die now quick\nPull up on him, Maradona kick\nI'll dangle you from a cedar tree like a pinata then bat you with a fuckin' hockey stick\nAnd keep beatin' your body with it until the candy (w)rapper that's inside of you eventually falls out of it\nI fucking {beep beep beep} take a fuckin' time bomb and shove it down your esophagus\nHave you coughing up blobs of phosphorus\nSince you're a narcissist you shouldn't have a problem when someone makes you swallow your own confidence\nI'll curb stomp this Erin Brockovitch lookin' nerd\nOff of his high horse then drag him by force from his nerdy ass little work offices\nI'll put him in a dirt plot, put the Earth on top of it\nI could put him in a box or a bag but this what he gon' earn (urn) off of this\nA fermented body in a reserved spot in a fully furbished German Sarcophagus\nThis is the most violent Socialist inside your metropolis\nHe wants to strike over politics\nReady to riot outside the White House in Washington\nGetting into a dildo fight with Milo Yiannopoulos\nHe said if it wasn't for the music he might've destroyed all of us\nPssst, well let's look at the ergonomics and purpose of this worthless comment\nYour verses has always been full of meaningless words\nSo no one gives a fuck about your new learning process\nWe never got to see the work in progress\nI'm a murderous terminologist\nA wordsmith and a workaholic\nYou a dirty Socialist that never earned shit but feel like you deserve a profit\nCapital One, tell me what's in your wallet\nYou said you can't focus on battle rap cause music is your obligation\nWell let's contemplate on Khan's template\nLet's spend a moment in a world of Khan's creations\nHis ancestors used to get fucked up in Concentration Camps\nBut he stays with a camp that fucks up his concentration\nIf you ask me, I think Khan is in his own constellation\nHis concept is so convoluted and drawn far outta context\nThat for me it's confirmation, if they ever held a nomination, who had the best content\nThat Khan verse (converse) wouldn't even be in the conversation\nWho does name flips like that?\nHow many concerts has Khan conducted?\nHow many projects has he conjured up or Khan constructed?\nI'll tell y'all...nothing!\nSo of course he gonna talk about my accomplishments\nI fucked up a lot of times, those were the hands I was dealt\nBut you aspire to battle people like Aspire\nSo naturally you'll never understand how battling someone like Canibus or Cassidy felt\nBecause you packed up and left, only to return like Kim Kardashian and make an ass out yourself\nCause what you say? \"I'm done. There's no battlers left.\"\nBut a real battle rapper doesn't beg for no hand outs or never asks for no help\nI'm the man because I became a man that can stand by himself\nAnd you here cause you battling Dizaster, that's it, you don't have nothing else\nI'm on a different level, I single handedly branded myself\nI shouldn't even have to meddle (metal) with these little pussies like a chastity belt\nI'm glad I came down to Oakland to give him this ass whippin'\nHe just panders to the crowd, acts like he cares about black culture\nHe just usin' black culture to push him, he drops one line about civil rights and the whole crowd overlooks him\nBut if you really believe the whites were gentrifying your city you would've moved yourself the fuck outta Brooklyn\nYou are literally an invader on a black man's turf\nAnd you're Jewish which makes it that much worse\nLiterally, you're the problem you're trying to take out\nAnd it's the same way back in the day, the GrindTime situation played out\nYou say, \"R.I.P. PH\", but when he alive you did him like a two faced snake\nLucky for you back then the little dirt never came out\nBut I got the info and then some\nHow he was helping you get some battles back when you couldn't even get your shit done\nHe was giving you views, helping you build them back up when you couldn't get none\nHe even gave you Cortez, that was your biggest name back then\nHe matched you against him\nAnd then as soon as the opportunity to battle on URL comes\nYou left him hanging on his next event, you bailed out and you ditched him\nA straight sucker from the Maze Runner, I wanna see you climb your way outta this one\nMan, ain't no safe house or escape routes, I'm pulling out the big guns, the big ones\nThe type to make Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff run\nAK's with the twin drums\nI call 'em \"Soul Crushers\" [?] scope on top\nYour dome gettin' popped\nI put Soul in a box like Ghostbusters\nY'all remember Ghostbusters?\nDan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, when they trapped Slimmer in that little box in the beginnin'?\nHe's like, \"No. I prefer the Ghostbusters version where they casted the women.\"\nOf course Soul Khan\nAnd I like women, I love women a lot\nBut what type of women are you talking about?\nThe ones that take photos for King Of The Dot?\nWhoa, it looks like we're going straight to the source\nOh well, I guess Soul Khan is only here now because he's going through a really rough divorce\nAnd it's funny because, he come in here like he has this master plan\nOh, but y'all don't understand this fam'\nThat no matter how you slice it, we lookin' at a queenless person, this is half a man\nHe's a- half of the king he used to be, he has half of his throne\nHalf of his belongings and only half of what he owns\nSo you can talk about my marriage, I'm happily married, I don't have a problem letting that shit be known\nI'd rather be that than this fuckin' depressed little fuckin' bachelor that doesn't have a home\nBehind this fuckin' feminist curtain there's a man that's sad and alone\nHe wanted to make all the women in the world happy but he couldn't even make his own woman happy at home\nAnd she gone now\nAin't no tellin' what ya ex-bitch might do\nHe said he wants to be a black man for the activist\nHe just mad his white ass found out his wife does too\nBut hold on to hope Soul Khan your dreams might come true\nIf she really your Soul mate\nThen wait nine years and maybe she'll make a comeback just like you\nAnd he thought I was gonna have 6,000,000 Jew jokes like I was gonna talk about Hitler\nWhen he's wasted ten years of his life with a photographer chick and he still doesn't get the picture\nOr maybe he does, and the rest is just numb\nCause the relationship dipped into a dark room and eventually developed into a negative one\nRumor is, after you got married, you stopped battling cause she didn't let you\nWhich is ironic cause your timing of coming back is soon as she left you\nYou need to face the music, she left you naked and made you look stupid\nBut hey, in a way she was perfect for you cause she ended up walking away from the ring the same way that you did\nThat shit is oh so cold\nShe walked in and she told you go\nI don't know man, it sounds like she signed a record deal or something cause that chick really sold her Soul\nMaybe it's because you're always going on about Trump\nTrump this, Trump that\nTrump he did this\nRepublican that\nGovernment that, government this\nAlways up in somebody's mix\nTo the point he left no attention to the special someone he's with\nWhat part of this doesn't he get?\nYour wife left you because of this shit\nProbably had enough of you running your lip\nThen she's probably out there right now aggressively suckin' some Republican's dick\nAnd that's just the hypothetical, here's where we cause the most damage\nI'm really sorry about this ammo cause this shit gon' get volcanic\nCause it's ahh kinda ahh, I kinda heard before she wanted to be with you she wanted to be with Organik\nOh man, and that's the bro Travis\nWhen he asked you for this battle, he was like, \"Bro have it.\"\nSame way he answered you when you asked about her\nHe was like, \"Bro have it.\"\nOh man, oh fuckin' dammit\nI don't even like getting this personal, these are your tactics\nYou the one that brought up QP's baby mama\nHis son, his child support and his taxes\nYou the fuckin' one that brought up Sandusky versus Rone cause you felt like it would be so savage\nYou the one that brought up Real Deal's son in not one, but multiple matches\nSo spare me this victim bullshit, cause your karma here is solely from the role that you practice\nNow onto our parents\nYou know how mad I get when people talk about my parents\nOh man\nOh man\nNow, what about our parents bro?\nHuh? What about our parents?\nMy mom....is a math teacher\nAnd your mom is a librarian\n\n[Soul Khan] Clerk\n\n[Dizaster]\nLibrarian clerk\nBut why are we comparing them?\nBecause women teachers? They queens, they deserve all the praise\nMinimum wage they deserve all the raise\nThey the most underappreciated in a way\nThen comes your mom\nSitting behind a desk, stamping books, twiddling her thumbs all day\nA library clerk, that's why her son came out into books like a nerd\nThat's where the mother/son similarities occur\nCause my mother is a math teacher...and I came out to be a Math teacher just like her\nNow hold on\nLet me talk about my dad since everybody wants to talk about him\nMy father's dad passed away when my dad was only 19\nAlright? His name was Bachir just like me\nHe had three younger brothers, and a little sister\nSo now forced to raise them on his own, he had no chance but to look for a bigger picture\nIn 1976, my pops saved up and bought his first car\nHad it on top of the hill, just parked on it, and that's when the civil war got started\nA dude named Michel Aoun and the Christian Armed Forces dropped a bomb on it\nNow when I say \"Christian\", y'all assume that I'm Muslim, right?\nBut I'm Druze, I'm not Muslim\nBut I loved them, they my brothers\nBut back then, we was in a holy land grab over religion\nA world driven by sectarianism\nYou wouldn't the meaning of a fucked up system\nThe people where I'm from will die to live where you live in\nTo eat the food that you eat to sip the water you drink\nAnd that's the reason you saw me protesting\nBut since you a spoiled little American brat\nI'ma explain America to you through my eyes to teach you this lesson\nNow let's go back to the 70's where I left you in that last scene\nWhere Michel Aoun blew up my father's car in front of our house in Baakleen\nNow this is where he knew he had to leave if he was to expand the family tree\nBut life there was lookin' hopeless\nSo the only place that could've gave us this life was the Land Of The Free\nThis is why I love America\nBecause my dad came here to build a path just for me\nAnd after that, he went bankrupt and we moved permanently\nThose next eight years would make me everything that I am\nIn the street, playing soccer, bare feet, kickin' the can\nIn the fuckin' mud 'til the sun came down, shit that really turned a kid to a man\nBut that was when you were in Woodland Hills with this little Gameboy in ya hand\nSo you wouldn't really understand would you?\nYeah, cause all we had was to be able to go out and play\nBut as Lebanese kids we were taught to be appreciative that in a way\nEven though all we had was cold showers most of the time and four hours of electricity during the day\nI lived through this shit\nAnd through the rest of my settlement, my country would be going through this development\nNow listen, you remember how I said the dude that blew up my dad's car in the first segment?\nOkay, this is why the whole thing is relevant\nThis is the reason I said the shit\nCause that same person, 30 years later has now been elected as our president\nWe're talking about somebody who's a political war criminal who executed thousands by his hand\nHe's killed everything I love and that's the reason I wave this flag\nYou hate the president of America because I understand\nHis policies make you mad\nHe's a goof, I know, the Tweets make you sad\nBut guess what\nI hate my president because he fuckin' broke up half my nation and damn near took away my dad\nAnd listen, this is real shit\nThey wanna start a holy war with Muslims, Druze and Christians\nBut I will never go back to the ways that are old tradition\nI would rather go over there and die with them then fight with them\nThose are my brothers those are my sisters\nI look at them like they my children\nNow listen, I understand there's inequality here towards blacks in this system\nThat has nothing to do with him\nI don't care how he sees the views if they've never been used against him\nSo for what it's worth, you right, I'm not Muslim\nI am Druze, alright?\nDo you know what that means?\nThat means we are under Walid Jumblatt, we are Socialist by birth\nThat means, I can tell you firsthand that we're supposed to be the most peaceful people on Earth\nI mean, we're supposed to be peaceful at birth\nBut if you push us we can be some of the most fuckin' violent people on Earth\nAnd the point being, is that you're a fuckin' wanna-be Socialist\nYou don't know what you're screwing with\nSocialism is in my fucking bloodline and I want nothing to do with it\nBecause I know first hand bro\nTrust me, I've lived under this Socialist government shit\nI'll tell you first hand that nothing gets fixed\nThe garbage doesn't even get picked up, no one gives a fuck about shit\nBut you wouldn't understand because you an inexperienced, uncultured son of a bitch\nThis ain't about the joke you living or the votes you gettin' in the real world people carry guns then die over Socialism\nYou want us to live in this global prison\nWhere we take orders from these fuckin' old tradition senior citizens\nThat are four times older than him\nSo the main point, you ain't never been through nothing like this\nAnd go back to what we were saying on our parents\nAlright? This is what it means to be a Lebanese-American\nIt's the journey it's where we came from and where our parents been\nSo since you think you gon' talk about my parents I'ma use my own parents to embarrass him\nBack to when we was talkin' about your mom being a librarian\nBut let's go to your dad now\nYou heard my dad's story, oh you ready\nYou heard my pop's story, his struggle was hard\nHe came here and turned an emotional scar and made himself to a star\nAnd I'm following in his footsteps\nWhich proves your pops is always a reflection of who you are\nBut what about your dad?\n\n[Soul Khan] He was a piece of shit\n\n[Dizaster]\nWell he was a lawyer, and that could be respected\nBut then what happened? He lost his bar\nAnd became an unemployed fucking loser taking business calls from his car\nWait a minute, that's not all\nHe was a musician like you, he wanted to top the charts\nHe thought it'd go far\nHibbity har har har\nAnd just like you, I doubt you'll make a career out of this ever\nSince you're admitting he's a shitty role model, then let me spend the rest of this to teach you how to do better\nYour pops at 19 got a deal with Capitol Records\nCompared to what happened to my dad at 19 that's substantially better\nLike way better\nBut then what happened?\nHe got dropped before he could put out any records\nAnd he was being managed by Phil Spector!\nLike- that's The Beatles manager, like how fuckin' bad can you be\nLike this is where your fuckin' personalities connect accurately\nBecause you both went to New York to become the man you could be\nI guess it's true what they say, the Big Apple doesn't fall far from the family tree\nAw man, everything about you is what makes you such a lame ass loser\nI'm too advanced\nThis like a cave man with his tools to a space man with a computer\nA space man with a computer-\nWait a minute\nFuck it, you wanna know what the fuckin' joke was about?\nSo who guessed the riddle I was putting out?\nLucy, a drug dealer with a hangover\nCoco, you plus me equals...human\nCousins, Caesar\nWhat are these names of?\nEvolution, primates\nSo to clear up the confusion\nThis about to be rebuttaled to everything he just said about the evolution\nNow, first of all, on the evolutionary chart\nOur most common oldest ancestor on Earth would be Lucy\nNow Lucy, is our oldest ancestor\nTechnically, like a human fused with an animal\nBy battle rap standards, that would be the beginning for us; Juice vs. Supernatural\nNow most of our class, evolved from that\nThose are the ancestors that both connect us\nAnd then there's you on the evolutionary chart\nOutta nowhere with the gay jokes\nYou would be...you would be homoerectus\nNow the anatomy of homoerectus...anatomy wise they were flat and small\nThey were loud, they had tiny hands, they were small\nThey had no balls and that was all\nThey thrived during the GrindTime Era, pay attention\nThis is gonna get crazy\nThey thrived during the GrindTime Era\nAlong with the emergence of a new group of hominids\nThose were called the Neanderthals\nThe GrindTime white guys\nPredominantly white, they felt like they had it all\nThey came into the game as giants which allowed them to stand up tall\nBut eventually their lack of culture will allow them to succumb to a massive fall\nWhich predicated the rise of the Cro Magnon man\nWe're movin' along the chart\nThe Cro Magnon man, in our standards that would be the URL rapper, the Chrome Magnum Man\nNow ironically enough, this the first man to use the tools\nAnd everything was cool\nBut eventually they couldn't come up with anything new\nAnd they hit the ceiling limit of their genetic pool\nThen comes the final transformation into today's modern homosapiens\nMe\nLux, Mook, Pat, Illmac, The Saurus, ICE, Goodz, Shine\nPeople that been here for generations\nAnd most of them branched way out through these changes\nIncluding me, I went through every single one of these evolutionary changes\nHold wait, that's why I got it down to a mathematic perfection\nCause now I'm giving you a timeline which is an accurate projection of where we had this connection\nAnd where we last left off at the last intersection\nCause you had no battles left, so it threw a monkey wrench in what was then your rapid progression\nWhich then lead you to get wiped out by natural selection\nDo I know about evolution? Maybe\nNow, this is where you learn something new here\nCause evolution ain't the only thing that I can do\nWe almost done, I need you to focus with me we're waaay past half way here, we're almost at the end\nWe at the end, we way past half way here\nI'm gonna need some crowd participation, are you guys awake here?\n{Crowd cheers}\nAlright, pull out your phones right now\nAnd trust me, I got all day, I could stay here\nGoogle \"Infinite Monkey\"\nTell me what that say here\n\n[Guy in the crowd]\n\"A monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for infinite about of time will surely complete works of William Shakespeare\n\n[Dizaster]\nWilliam Shakespeare\nOoh, that's another picture I put out, the sixth clue\nThey say if a infinite amount of monkeys type on an infinite amount of typewriters in an infinite amount of universes\nThey should be able to replicate the work of Shakespeare\nBut later on this theory would disprove itself\nAnd actually say that, for that to be possible the probability of it is the closest number to zero\nAnd this is why me and  you will never be equal\nThis is what separates us from monkeys as people\nBecause you see, even if you took a million, trillion infinite Soul Khans in a trillion trillion universes\nYou will never be able to truly replicate the truest purpose of this human's verses\nAnd that's why I made this\nTo let you know that you could never reach me\nI became an advanced being in this and you will always be that fuckin' monkey underneath me\nPussy\nTIME!Embed"}, {"name": "Are You Gonna Kiss Me or Not", "artist": "Thompson

West Texas wind\nDashing and daring, a drink he was sharing\nWith wicked Feleena, the girl that I love\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo in anger, I challenged his right for the love of this maiden\nDown went his hand for the gun that he wore\nMy challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat\nThe handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor\n[Full-Length Version - Verse 4]\nJust for a moment, I stood there in silence\nShocked by the foul, evil deed I had done\nMany thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there\nI had but one chance, and that was to run\n\n[Chorus 2]\nOut through the back door of Rosa's, I ran\nOut where the horses were tied\nI caught a good one, it looked like it could run\nUp on its back, and away I did ride\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nJust as fast as I could\nFrom the West Texas town of El

Wexford border\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I met her at Guy's in the second World War\nAnd she was working on a soldier's ward\nNever had I seen such beauty before\nThe moment that I saw her\nNancy was my yellow rose\nAnd we got married wearing borrowed clothes\nWe got eight children, now growing old\nFive sons and three daughters\n\n[Chorus]\nShe and I went on the run\nDon't care about religion\nI'm

snow white streak in her jet black hair\nOver sixty years I've been loving her\nNow we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs\nYou know Nancy, I adore ya\nFrom a farm boy born near Belfast town\nI

die\nWhen I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and I cry\nI bet there's rich folks eatin' in some fancy dining car\nThey're probably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars\nWell, I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free\nBut those people keep a-movin' and that's what tortures me\nWell, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine\nI bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line\nFar from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay\nAnd I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues awayYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"name": "Tonight I Wanna Cry", "artist":

into Texas with the hammer down\nAnd a rocking little combo from the Guitar Town\nHey pretty baby, don't you know it ain't my fault?\nI love to hear the steel belts humming on the asphalt\nWake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop\nStumble in the restaurant wondering why I don't stop\n\nWell I got to keep rocking while I still can\nI got a two pack habit and a motel tan\nWhen my boots hit the boards, I'm a brand new man\nWith my back to the riser, I make my stand\nHey pretty baby, won't you hold me tight?\nI'm loading up and rolling out of here tonight\nOne of these days I'm gonna settle down\nAnd take you back with me to the Guitar TownSee Steve Earle LiveGet tickets as low as $100You might also likeEmbed"}]}
