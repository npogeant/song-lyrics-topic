by the end of the Pont Royal towards the Gare d'Orsay, M.

He called a porter, and gave him the heavy valise and the bundle of rugs that formed the whole of his hand baggage.\n\n\"Where is the office for forwarding luggage, my man?\" he enquired.\n\nThe porter led him through the famous panelled hall of the Gare d'Orsay, and M. Etienne Rambert satisfied himself that his trunks had been properly registered for Verri\u00e8res, the station at which he had to alight for the ch\u00e2teau of Beaulieu.\n\nStill attended by the porter, who had conceived a respectful admiration for him in consequence of the authoritative tone in which he demanded information from the various railway servants, and who scented a probable munificent tip, M.

He spent a few minutes more at the book-stall where he selected an imposing collection of illustrated papers, and then, his final preparations completed, he turned once more to the porter.\n\n\"The Luchon train,\" he said; \"where is it?\" and as the man only made a vague gesture and growled something wholly indistinct, he added: \"Lead the way, and I will follow.\"\n\nIt was now just half-past eight, and the station showed all the animation inseparable from the departure of main-line trains.

Etienne Rambert hurried onwards, and reaching the platform from which all the lines begin, was stayed by the porter who was laden with his baggage.\n\"You want the express, sir?\"\n\n\"No, the slow train, my man.\"\n\nThe porter showed some surprise, but made no remark.\n\n\"Do you like the front or the back of the train?\"\n\n\"The back by choice.\"\n\n\"First-class, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, first-class.\"\n\nThe porter, who had stopped a moment, picked up the heavy valise again.\n\n\"Then there isn't any choice. There are only two first-class carriages on the slow train, and they are both in the middle.\"\n\n\"They are corridor carriages, I suppose?\" said Etienne Rambert.\n\n\"Yes, sir; there are hardly any others on the main-line trains, especially first-class.\"\n\nIn the ever-increasing crowd Etienne Rambert had some difficulty in following the porter. The Gare d'Orsay has little or none of the attractiveness of the other stations, which cannot fail to have a certain fascination for any imaginative person, who thinks of the mystery attaching to all those iron rails reaching out into the distance of countries unknown to him. It is less noisy than the others also, for between Austerlitz and Orsay the traction is entirely electric. And further, there is no clearly defined separation between the main and the suburban lines.\n\nOn the right of the platform was the train which was to take Etienne Rambert beyond Brives to Verri\u00e8res, the slow train to Luchon; and on the left of the same platform was another train for Juvisy and all the small stations in the suburbs of Paris.\nVery few people were making for the train to Luchon; but a large crowd was pressing into the suburban train.\n\nThe porter who was piloting M. Etienne Rambert, set the baggage he was carrying down on the footboard of a first-class carriage.\n\n\"There is no one for the slow train yet, sir; if you like to get in first you can choose your own compartment.\"\n\nM. Etienne Rambert acted on the suggestion, but he had hardly set foot in the corridor before the guard, also scenting a generous tip, came to offer his services.\n\n\"It really is the 8.50 you want, sir?\" was his first enquiry. \"You are sure you are not making a mistake?\"\n\n\"No,\" Etienne Rambert replied. \"Why?\"\n\n\"A great many first-class passengers do make a mistake,\" the man explained, \"and confuse the 8.50 with the 8.45 express.\"\n\nAs he spoke the guard took the baggage from the porter who had remained on the platform, and the porter, after being generously remunerated for his trouble by M. Rambert, hurried away to look for other travellers.\n\n\"The 8.45 is the express, isn't it?\" M. Rambert enquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" the guard answered; \"it runs right through without stopping at all the small stations as this train does. It goes in front of this one and gets to Luchon three hours earlier. There it is on the side there,\" and he pointed through the window in the door on the far side to another train on the next rails, in which a number of travellers were already taking their seats. \"If you prefer to go by that one, sir,\" he went on, \"there is still time for you to change; you are entitled to take your choice since you have a first-class ticket.\"\n\nBut Etienne Rambert, after a moment's consideration, declined the suggestion.\n\n\"No: I would rather go by the slow train. If I take the express I should have to get out at Brives, and then I should be twelve or thirteen miles from Saint-Jaury, which is my destination; whereas the slow train stops at Verri\u00e8res, where, by the way, I have already telegraphed to say I shall arrive to-morrow morning.\"\n\nHe walked a little way along the corridor, assuring himself that the various compartments were still quite empty, and then turned to the guard.\n\"Look here, my man,\" he said, \"I am awfully tired, and I mean to get some sleep to-night; consequently I should like to be alone. Now where shall I be most quiet and undisturbed?\"\n\nThe man understood. M. Etienne Rambert's enquiry about the place where he would be most quiet, was an implicit promise of a handsome tip if nobody did disturb him.\n\n\"If you like to settle yourself here, sir,\" the man answered, \"you can draw down the blinds at once, and I dare say I shall be able to find room for any other passengers somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said M. Rambert, moving towards the compartment indicated. \"I will smoke a cigar until the train starts, and immediately afterwards I will settle down to sleep. By the way, my man, since you seem so obliging, I wish you would undertake to call me to-morrow morning in time for me to get out at Verri\u00e8res. I am desperately sleepy and I am quite capable of not waking up.\"\n\nThe guard touched his cap.\n\n\"You can be perfectly easy, sir, and sleep without the least anxiety. I won't fail.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nWhen his baggage had been stowed away, and his rugs spread out to make the seat more comfortable still, M. Etienne Rambert repeated his appeal, for he was an old traveller and knew that it does not do to rely too much upon the promises of chance attendants.\n\n\"I can rely upon you, can't I? I may sleep as sound as I like, and you will wake me at Verri\u00e8res?\" And the more to assure himself that the guard would execute his orders he slipped a franc into his hand.\n\nWhen he was left alone, M. Rambert continued his preparations for the night. He carefully drew down the blinds over the door and over the windows of the compartment that gave on to the corridor, and also lowered the shade over the electric light, and then, in order to enjoy the last puffs at his cigar in peace, he opened the window over the other door and leant his elbows on it, watching the final preparations being made by the travellers by the express on the other line.\n\nThe departure of a train is always a picturesque sight, and M. Rambert leant forward inquisitively to note how the passengers had installed themselves in the two compartments which he could see from his coign of vantage.\n\nThere were not many people in the train. As a matter of fact the Brives and Luchon line is not much used at this time of year. If the number of passengers in the express were any criterion Etienne Rambert might reasonably expect that he would be the only one in the slow train. But there was not much time for observations and reflections of this kind. On the platform for the express, which he got a glimpse of through the compartments, people were hurrying up their farewells. The passengers had got into their carriages, and the friends who had come to see them off were standing alone upon the platform. There was the sound of safety locks being fastened by porters, and the noise of trollies being wheeled along bearing articles for sale.\n\n\"Pillows! Rugs! Sweets! Papers!\"\n\nThen came the whistle of the guard, the shriller scream from the electric engine, and then, slowly at first but steadily, more rapidly as the engine got up speed, the express moved along the platform and plunged into the tunnel on the way to Austerlitz.\n\nMeanwhile the guard of the slow train was doing wonders. Shamelessly resolved to assure perfect quiet to \"his\" passenger, he managed, without unduly compromising himself but yet without leaving any doubt about it in any mind, to insinuate discreetly that M. Rambert's carriage was reserved, so that that gentleman might count upon an entirely undisturbed night.\n\nA few minutes after the express had gone, the slow train drew out in its turn, and disappeared into the darkness of the underground tunnel.\n\nAt the ch\u00e2teau of Beaulieu young Charles Rambert was just finishing dressing when a gentle tap sounded on the door of his room.\n\n\"It is a quarter to five, Charles. Get up at once!\"\n\n\"I am awake already, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se,\" Charles Rambert answered with some pride. \"I shall be ready in two minutes.\"\n\n\"What? up already?\" the girl exclaimed from the other side of the door. \"Marvelous! I congratulate you. I'm ready too; I will wait for you in the dining-room. Come down as soon as you are dressed.\"\n\n\"All right!\" the young man answered.\n\nHe wasted no time over his toilette, the more so because it was none too warm in his room, for at this early hour it was still quite dark; and then taking his light in one hand he opened his door carefully so as to make no noise, tip-toed along the landing, and went down the staircase to join Th\u00e9r\u00e8se in the dining-room. The girl was an accomplished housekeeper already, and while waiting for the young fellow she had got a scratch meal together.\n\n\"Let us have breakfast quickly,\" she suggested; \"it isn't snowing this morning, and if you like we might walk to the station. We have plenty of time, and it will do us good to have a walk.\"\n\n\"It will warm us up anyhow,\" Charles Rambert replied; he was only half-awake, but he sat beside Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and did justice to the preparations she had made.\n\n\"Do you know that it is very wonderful of you to get up so punctually?\" Mme. de Langrune's granddaughter remarked. \"How did you manage it? Last night you were afraid you would sleep on as usual.\"\n\n\"It was not much trouble for me to wake up,\" Charles Rambert answered. \"I hardly closed an eye all night.\"\n\n\"But I promised to come and knock at your door myself, so you might have slept without any anxiety.\"\n\n\"That's so, but to tell you the truth, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, I was regularly upset and excited by the thought of papa arriving this morning.\"\n\nThey had both finished breakfast, and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se got up.\n\n\"Shall we start?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se opened the hall door, and the two young people went down the flight of steps leading to the garden. The girl had thrown a big cloak over her shoulders, and she inhaled the pure morning air with keen delight.\n\n\"I love going out in the early morning,\" she declared.\n\n\"Well, I don't like it at all,\" Charles Rambert confessed with characteristic candour. \"Good Lord, how cold it is! And it is still pitch dark!\"\n\n\"Surely you are not going to be frightened?\" said Th\u00e9r\u00e8se teasingly.\n\nCharles Rambert made an irritable movement of vexation and surprise.\n\n\"Frightened? What do you take me for, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se? If I don't like going out in the early morning it's really only because it is cold.\"\n\nShe laughed at him while they were crossing the lawn towards the out-buildings, through which she meant to get out on to the high road. As they passed the stables they came across a groom who was leisurely getting an old brougham out of the coach-house.\n\n\"Don't hurry, Jean,\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se called out as she greeted him. \"We are going to walk to the station, and the only important thing is that you should be there to bring us back.\"\n\nThe man touched his cap and the two young people passed through the park gate and found themselves upon the high road.\n\nIt was still very dark, with just a wan reflection in the distance of the sky vaguely outlining some cloud-shapes to the eastward to give some promise of the day. There was no sound to break the silence of the fields, and as they walked briskly along Charles and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se could hear their footsteps ringing on the hard surface of the frozen ground.\n\n\"It must please you awfully to be going to meet your father,\" said Mme. de Langrune's granddaughter half questioningly. \"It is a long time since you have seen him, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Three years,\" Charles Rambert answered, \"and then just for a few minutes. He is coming home from America now, and before that he travelled in Spain for a long time.\"\n\n\"He was travelling the whole time you were a child, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, always: either in Colombia, looking after his rubber plantations there, or in Spain, where he has a good deal of property too. When he was in Paris he used to come to the school and ask for me, and I saw him in the parlour\u2014for a quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"And your mother?\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma was different. You know, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, I spent all  the childhood that I can remember at the school. I liked the masters and had good chums, and was very happy there, and if the truth must be told I looked forward with anything but pleasure to the holidays, when I had to go to my parents' house. I always felt a stranger with them; my real home was the school-room, where I had my desk and all my own interests. And then, you know, when one is little one doesn't understand things much; I didn't feel having hardly any family, very much.\"\n\n\"But you loved your mother very much?\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se asked the question quite anxiously, and it was patent that she would have thought it dreadful if her companion had not had a real affection for his mother.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I loved her,\" Charles Rambert answered; \"but I hardly knew her either.\" And as Th\u00e9r\u00e8se showed her surprise he went on, telling her something of the secret of his lonely childhood. \"You see, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, now that I am a man I guess lots of things that I could not have had even a suspicion of then. My father and mother did not get on well together. They were what you call an ill-assorted couple. They were both very good, but their characters did not harmonise. When I was little I always saw mamma silent and sad, and papa active and on the go, and bright and talking at the top of his voice. I half believe he frightened mamma! And then my father was constantly away, whereas mamma hardly ever went out. When a servant took me to the house on Thursdays, I was taken up to say good morning to her, and I invariably found her lying on a sofa in her room, with the blinds down and almost dark. She just touched me with her lips and asked me one or two questions, and then I was taken away again because I tired her.\"\n\n\"Was she ill, then?\"\n\n\"Mamma always has been ill. I suppose you know, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, that three months ago\u2014stay, it was just when I had taken my degree and went to Germany\u2014she was sent to an asylum? I believe my father had wanted her to agree to undergo careful treatment of the kind long before, but she would not.\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se was silent for a few minutes.\n\n\"You have not been very happy,\" she said presently.\n\n\"Oh, it was only after I grew up that I felt unhappy. When I was a little chap I never thought of how sad it is to have no real father or mother. The last four or five years it has hurt me, but when he came to see me once at school, papa told me he would take me with him as soon as I had taken my degree and grown up. Last October, after my examination, he wrote and told me to be patient a little longer, and that he was hurrying on with the winding up of his business and coming back to France. That gave me a hope which has brightened these last few months, and will also make you understand why I am so pleased this morning at my fathers coming. It seems to me that a new life is going to begin.\"\n\nDay was breaking now: a dirty December day, with the light filtering through heavy grey clouds that drifted along the ground, hid the horizon, clung to the low hills, and then suddenly dispersed in long wisps driven by a keen breeze, that got up in gusts, and drove clouds of dust along the hard frozen ground.\n\n\"I have not been very happy either,\" said Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, \"for I lost my father when I was tiny: I don't even remember him; and mamma must be dead as well.\"\n\nThe ambiguous turning of the child's phrase caught Charles Rambert's interested attention.\n\n\"What does that mean, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se? Don't you know if your mother is dead?\"\n\n\"Yes, oh yes; grandmamma says so. But whenever I ask for particulars grandmamma always changes the subject. I will echo what you said just now: when you are little you don't know anything and are not surprised at anything. For a long time I took no notice of her sudden reticence, but now I sometimes wonder if something is not being kept back from me\u2014whether it is really true that mamma is no more in this world.\"\n\nTalking like this Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Charles had walked at a good pace, and now they came to the few houses built around Verri\u00e8res station. One by one, bedroom windows and doors were being opened; peasants were making their way to the sheds to lead their cattle to the pastures.\n\n\"We are very early,\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se remarked, pointing to the station clock in the distance. \"Your father's train is due at 6.55, and it is only 6.40 now; we still have a quarter of an hour to wait, and more, if the train is not punctual!\"\n\nThey went into the little station and Charles Rambert, thankful for some shelter from the cold, stamped his feet, making a sudden uproar in the empty waiting-room. A porter appeared.\n\n\"Who the deuce is kicking up all this row?\" he began angrily, and then seeing Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, broke off short. \"Ah, Mademoiselle Th\u00e9r\u00e8se,\" he said with the familiar yet perfectly respectful cordiality that marks country folk, \"up already? Have you come to meet somebody, or are you going away?\"\n\nAs he spoke, the porter turned a curious eye upon Charles Rambert, whose arrival had caused quite a sensation two days before in this little spot, where with but few exceptions none but people belonging to the neighbourhood ever came by train.\n\n\"No, I am not going away,\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied. \"I have accompanied M. Rambert, who has come to meet his father.\"\n\n\"Ah-ha, to meet your papa, sir: is he coming from far?\"\n\n\"From Paris,\" Charles Rambert answered. \"Is the train signalled yet?\"\n\nThe man drew out a watch like a turnip, and looked at the time.\n\n\"It won't be here for quite another twenty minutes. The work on the tunnel makes it necessary to be careful, and it's always late now. But you will hear when the bell rings: that will be when the train is coming over the level-crossing; it will run into the station three minutes after that. Well, Mademoiselle, I must get on with my work,\" and the man left them.\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se turned to Charles Rambert.\n\n\"Shall we go on to the platform? Then we shall see the train come in.\"\n\nSo they left the waiting-room and began to walk up and down the whole length of the platform. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se watched the jerky movements of the hands of the clock, and smiled at her companion.\n\n\"Five minutes more, and your father will be here! Four minutes more! Ah! There it is!\" and she pointed to a slope in the distance where a slight trail of smoke rose white against the blue of the sky, now clear of cloud. \"Can't you see it? That is the steam from the engine coming out of the tunnel.\"\n\nEre she finished speaking the quivering whir of the bell echoed through the empty station.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Charles Rambert: \"at last!\"\n\nThe two porters who, with the stationmaster, constituted the entire railway staff at Verri\u00e8res, came bustling along the platform, and while the bell continued its monotonous whirring ring, pulled forward trucks in readiness for any possible luggage. Puffing portentously, the engine slackened speed, and the heavy train slowed down and finally stopped, bringing a noisy atmosphere of life into the station of Verri\u00e8res that but a moment ago was so still.\n\nThe first-class carriages had stopped immediately in front of Charles and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and on the footboard Etienne Rambert stood, a tall, elderly man of distinguished appearance, proud bearing and energetic attitude, with extraordinarily keen eyes and an unusually high and intelligent forehead. Seeing Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Charles he seized his baggage and in a twinkling had sprung on to the platform. He dropped his valise, tossed his bundle of rugs on to a seat, and gripped Charles by the two shoulders.\n\n\"My boy!\" he exclaimed; \"my dear boy!\"\n\nAlthough he had hitherto shown so little affection for his child, it was obvious that the man was making a great effort to restrain his emotion, and was really moved when he now saw him again as a grown young man.\n\nNor, on his part, did Charles Rambert remain unmoved. As if the sudden grip of this almost stranger, who yet was his father, had awakened a world of memories within him, he turned very pale and his voice faltered as he replied:\n\n\"Papa! Dear papa! I am so glad to see you!\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se had drawn tactfully aside. M. Rambert still held his son by the shoulders and stepped back a pace, the better to consider him.\n\n\"Why, you are a man! How you have altered, my boy! You are just what I hoped you would be: tall and strong! Ah, you are my son all right! And you are quite well, hey? Yet you look tired.\"\n\n\"I did not sleep well,\" Charles explained with a smile. \"I was afraid I should not wake up.\"\n\nTurning his head, M. Rambert saw Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and held out his hand.\n\n\"How do you do, my little Th\u00e9r\u00e8se?\" he exclaimed. \"You have altered too since I saw you last. I left a little chit of a child, and now I behold a grown-up young lady. Well! I must be off at once to pay my respects to my dear old friend, your grandmother. All well at the ch\u00e2teau, eh?\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se shook hands warmly with M. Rambert and thanked him prettily.\n\n\"Grandmamma is very well; she told me to tell you to excuse her if she did not come to meet you, but her doctor says she must not get up very early.\"\n\n\"Of course your grandmamma is excused, my dear. Besides, I have to thank her for her kindness to Charles, and for the hospitality she is going to extend to me for a few days.\"\n\nMeanwhile the train had gone on again, and now a porter came up to M. Rambert.\n\n\"Will you take your luggage with you, sir?\"\n\nRecalled to material things, Etienne Rambert contemplated his trunk which the porters had taken out of the luggage van.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he began, but Th\u00e9r\u00e8se interrupted him.\n\n\"Grandmamma said she would send for your heavy luggage during the morning, and that you could take your valise and any small parcels with us in the brougham.\"\n\n\"What's that? Your grandmamma has taken the trouble to send her carriage?\"\n\n\"It's a long way to Beaulieu, you know,\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied. \"Ask Charles if it isn't. We came on foot and the walk would be too tiring for you after a whole night in the train.\"\n\nThe three had reached the station yard, and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se stopped in surprise.\n\n\"Why, how's that?\" she exclaimed; \"the carriage is not here.  And yet Jean was beginning to get it ready when we left the ch\u00e2teau.\"\n\nM. Etienne Rambert was resting one hand on his son's shoulder, and contemplating him with an affectionate, all-embracing survey every now and then. He smiled at Th\u00e9r\u00e8se.\n\n\"He may have been delayed, dear. I tell you what we will do. Since your grandmamma is going to send for my luggage there is no need for me to take my valise; we can leave everything in the cloak-room and start for the ch\u00e2teau on foot; if my memory serves me right\u2014and it is a very good memory\u2014there is only one road, so we shall meet Jean and can get into the carriage on the way.\"\n\nA few minutes later all three set out on the road to Beaulieu. M. Rambert walked between the two young people; he had gallantly offered his arm to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, who was not a little proud of the attention, which proved to her mind that she was now regarded as a grown-up young lady. On the other side of his father Charles made answer to the incessant questions put to him.\n\nM. Etienne Rambert enjoyed the walk in the quiet morning through the peaceful country-side. With a tender half-melancholy he recognised every turn in the road, every bit of scenery.\n\n\"Just fancy my coming back here at sixty years of age, with a great son of eighteen!\" he said with a laugh. \"And I remember as if it were yesterday the good times I have had at the ch\u00e2teau of Beaulieu. Mme. de Langrune and I will have plenty of memories to talk over. Gad! it must be quite forty years since I came this way, and yet I remember every bit of it. Say, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, isn't it the fact that we shall see the front of the ch\u00e2teau directly we have passed this little copse?\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" the girl answered with a laugh. \"You know the country very well, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Etienne Rambert; \"when one gets to my age, little Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, one always does remember the happy days of one's youth; one remembers recent events much less distinctly. Most likely that means, my dear, that the human heart declines to grow old and refuses to preserve any but pictures of childhood.\"\n\nFor a few minutes M. Rambert remained silent, as if absorbed in somewhat melancholy reflections. But he soon recovered himself and shook off the tender sadness evoked in his mind by memories of the past.\n\n\"Why, the park enclosure has been altered,\" he exclaimed. \"Here is a wall which used not to be here: there was only a hedge.\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se laughed.\n\n\"I never knew the hedge,\" she said. \"I have always seen the wall.\"\n\n\"Must we go on to the main gate?\" M. Rambert asked, \"or has your grandmamma had another gate made?\"\n\n\"We are going in by the out-buildings,\" the girl answered; \"then we shall hear why Jean did not come to meet us.\" She opened a little door half-hidden among the moss and ivy that clothed the wall surrounding the park, and making M. Rambert and Charles pass in before her, cried: \"But Jean has gone with the brougham, for the horses are not in the stable. How was it we did not meet him?\" Then she laughed. \"Poor Jean! He is so muddle-headed! I would not mind betting he went to meet us at Saint-Jaury, as he does every morning to bring me home from church.\"\n\nThe little company, Etienne Rambert, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Charles, were now approaching the ch\u00e2teau. Passing beneath Mme. de Langrune's windows Th\u00e9r\u00e8se called merrily up to them.\n\n\"Here we are, grandmamma!\"\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nBut at the window of an adjoining room appeared the figure of the steward, Dollon, making a gesture, as if asking for silence.\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se, in advance of her guests, had proceeded but a few yards when Mme. de Langrune's old servant rushed down the stone flight of steps in front of the ch\u00e2teau, towards M. Rambert.\n\nDollon seemed distraught. Usually so respectful and so deferential in manner, he now seized M. Rambert by the arm, and imperiously waving Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Charles away, drew him aside.\n\n\"It is awful, sir,\" he exclaimed: \"horrible: a fearful thing has happened. We have just found Mme. la Marquise dead\u2014murdered\u2014in her room!\"Embed"}, {"name": "Should I Stay or Should I Go", "artist": "The Clash", "lyrics": "Should I Stay or Should I Go Lyrics[Intro]\nOh!

I credit my father for introducing me to my greatest role model outside of my family.\n\u201cA coward dies a thousand times, a soldier dies but once.\u201d The best influence I gained from Mr. Shakur was to have a strong heart, will, and mind. With these things intact no way you can be deterred by anyone else. Letting someone break your down your heart to fight to can break your will. If you lose your will you can become weak minded and you need all three to survive. It\u2019s like he always said, \u201cIf you can make it through the night, there\u2019s a brighter day.\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a natural-born leader. I know how to bow down to authority if it\u2019s authority that I respect.\u201d Another lesson I learned was to never give in to anyone and say what\u2019s on your mind. The first amendment is the right to freedom of speech. Shakur believed that we all should exercise this right. He also believed that no badge of authority is just given respect but, it is earned just as anyone else will have to earn it. \u201cSh*t, I like to think that at every opportunity I\u2019ve ever been threatened with resistance, it\u2019s been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s in my veins to fight back.\u201d It was in his blood to fight back that\u2019s why he\u2019ll never bow down to just any authority.\n\n\u201cI see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin\u2019, I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I\u2019m saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it\u2019s time to make millions for myself; you know what I\u2019m saying. I made millions for the record companies; I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us\u201d here he says he worked and earned every penny he has and gained his respect along with it. Hard work gives you everything you deserve.Prompt: What makes you, you?\n\nMy life had many ups and downs, when I was a baby I was filled with smiles, laughed all the time, but that soon changed. I became an angry child or waterfalls of tears would run off may face during my child hood. Over time I learned to accept life, and then I learned to be happy. And I became a rosy cheek kid that tries to live an easy going life.\n\nwhen I was a kid with a face as red as a burring flame on the sun and sad, it all seem to be tied to how my life was going, my father was arrested and I could only see him for short times compared to when I spent entire days with him. I started living with people I barely knew but my mom new quite well, these people where called grandparents. And the things I always knew where changing for the rest of my life and it was a lot for a kid of four to take in and, caused pain for many years.\n\nLater in my life the streams if tears flowed so rapidly that soon I tried to make dams of rope at the line of the neck. My grandfather that I did not know as I child I learned to love like a second father had passed. So with the dames at a brake I knew it was time for a change. Whenever I would feel down I would search the ends of the earth to find the good in what is happening so that helped me learn how to except the negative thing that happen in my life. Once my grandfather passed who we depended on with most of our lives, poverty had soon come. We struggled to feed our self\u2019s and we ended up having to move to a house a third of the size of what we once had. With that I learned to enjoy a loaf of bread instead of wanting a five course meal.\n\nWith all the challenges that happened in my life I grew to a bigger, stronger, and better person. Through my whole life the warmth of a mother hug and the kiss from the heart a grandmother gives when times seem blue helped me adapt the love and care I try to share with others. In the past I was a heated person temper as strong as an ox. But there is only so much anger a person can handle in their life and over time I became to be where only the biggest things can makes my blood boil. After having a past of anger and people who said I was weird and a nut, I decided to let it roll off the cheek and became determined to still be that nut but be the best I can, I adapted determination from that point on.\n\nThrough the roller coaster of my life I\u2019ve lived hard painful times, with loss of love ones and massive changes. And I\u2019ve had good times as well with love and happiness. People would think on how I was as a child I would be this miserable adult but they were wrong. I am living proof that challenges as hard as they may come can make a better person. I was a dark souled being that changed into a great, loving and, caring person. Who is determined and fallows my dreams.Prompt: Describe an important transition in your life.\n\nSince we were born we were told how important college is, we were told that we should already know what we want to do, and what college we want to attend. Even though we really don\u2019t have any fore knowledge on what college really is, we are still expected to go. This, to me is the hardest transition anyone can face, making it the most important.\n\nFiguring out what you want to be when you grow up, we have been asked this question ever since the beginning of public school, kindergarten. Isn\u2019t it ridiculous? Asking a five year what he/she wants to do when she/he is 20. Back then we all were oblivious to how fast life really moves; we didn\u2019t know that outside of crayons and story time, there was a world waiting to be explored. Even though we had no idea where money comes from, or how a government works, we were still asked, \u201cwhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d Present day, that question triggers anxiety, and pent up confusion, because the answer isn\u2019t as simple as \u201crock star\u201d anymore, now you need a real answer.\n\nPeople say that high school is the best years of school you will ever have, because we can\u2019t go back to it. Make your friends now, keep up with your grades, join school clubs, and get a part time job, pay your dues, graduate. It\u2019s either now or never, go big or get a GED.\nBeing pressured into going to college is probably the worst thing that can happen to anyone, it isn\u2019t the 1960\u2019s anymore, and we have other options. With tuition rising and employment decreasing, graduating college and getting a job is harder than ever, not to mention student loans.\n\nThat\u2019s why I feel this transition is so important, it opens the eyes of our generation, and things aren\u2019t easy. We\u2019ve all been handed a crystal clear picture of going to college being the only thing we can do. Growing up happens fast, and this still goes for the lucky ones that already have an idea of what they want to do after high school. For us, graduation will be the strangest feeling, no more school, no more summer break, no more standardized tests, we will all be floating around in our cap and gown trying to grasp the fact that we are done. I think that\u2019s when you actually become an adult, because; isn\u2019t that what adulthood is? Just a bunch of kids trying to figure everything out. That\u2019s what makes this transition an important one, because it\u2019s the hardest one we will face.Prompt: Discuss some issue of personal, local, or national concern and its importance to you\n\nPolice Brutality is a national concern we need to put an end to. The people who are supposed to be protecting us are killing us! We the people must eliminate this racism and brutality in our police force. There is no time to waste action must be takin now.\nBrutality is not the way anyone should go. Our right as a citizen must be protected at all times. Nobody is above our rights or laws. Black minorities are the main people targeted by this threat. Most people would\u2019ve thought we\u2019ve move passed this racism. Equality is what needs to be seen in the eyes of not just officers but everyone.\n\nIn my own experience I\u2019ve seen white cops treat other races (Mainly Blacks) as if they were animals. We are no different than anyone else. Cops need to accept the fact that we are all the same on the inside. People are getting shot and killed for no reason. In the United States, major political and social movements have involved excessive force by police.Prompt:  \u201cDescribe a Person who has Influenced Your Life- Grandpa\u201d\n\nAs the sun began to peak through the fine curtains, I clenched my eyes and inhale the sweet odor of homemade biscuits and smoky sausages specially made by my pleasurable grand-mama. My limps felt detached and strained but my stomach was roaring another tune, soon became in debate with worn-out body. I eased to the edge of the bed leisurely took a quick glance at the clock. I didn\u2019t bother reading the time though; I just know it was too early to hear that faint bussing outside. It was Saturday morning and the routine remained the same as always, I shimmied over to the one window facing the back yard already knowing what I was searching for, my grand-daddy.\n\nMy grand-daddy wore a plaid red and black shirt, faded blue jean overalls and some dusty old work boot to mow the lawn in the early morning as, he rode his lawn mower from side to side and every few seconds he would briefly slowed down to spit his burnt sienna colored chewing tobacco, wipe his mouth with a bright white handkerchief and continue his journey.\n\nMy grand-daddy is the chief of the Totten family. Born and raised in Yanceyville, North Carolina. He received only a 5th grade education and from there worked in the family business of farmers. He is the second youngest of four brothers and a sister. Out of all of his siblings except his sister he was the only one to ever go to school and come out with a work ethic of devotion. He puts his all in everything he does from head to toe this man has gave honor to the Totten\u2019s name.Prompt:  Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on me, and describe that influence. The one person who has changed my life the most has to be both of my brother\u2019s for good and bad.\n\nMy brothers have had the most influence on me because I don\u2019t want to be anything like at all. They both have been in and out of jail not for anything big like rape or murder but for dumb things like weed. But it\u2019s not the fact that they went to jail that scary me and makes me not want to be anything like them but it the fact I seen everything that my mother has gone through because of brother\u2019s and that\u2019s what makes me want to be nothing like them fools.\n\nSo yea that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to be anything like my bothers they are good for nothing that just mess things up in my life and everyone else life there even messing up your life right now you don\u2019t even know it. But for real if anyone how had impacted my life it would be them for the fact that I don\u2019t want to be like them. But then you could look at it for another point of view and say they actually are good because of their massive mistake now I wound not make the same mistake they did.Topic: The Place That I Know Well\n\nTexas is the place that I know well. I have been to Texas lots of times in my life. Texas is a great place to be at. There are lots of things that you can do in Texas. It is a place that you ca have a great time and also relaxes. It is the place that I know bather than anything else in the world.\n\nTexas is where most of the things happen. You can feel the heat thrower your skin as you get closer to Texas. You can see lots of different things happening at the same time. Lots of cars passing by you as you go thrower the highway. There are lots of restaurant where you can eat at. You can small the different foods once you go inside the restaurant. Texas is as big as the United States.\n\nEvery time I go to Texas I just can just relaxes all day. I feel happy every time I go there. It is the place that can make you feel safe at all times. It is where I can see lots of things that can make you feel happy. For example every time I go to the beach I have a great time there. Also when I go to see family members and have a great time with them.Prompt: If you offered the role of the villain or the hero in a movie, which role would you accept and why?\n\nHere come Jaeblast!! As the crowd would scream as I enter a nearby metropolis to save the day from evil. The role of a super hero is one role I would consider a choice of picking. Having superpower would be insane for me to decline that role because I would see myself as a protagonist and I believe I\u2019m a good person by heart and soul.\n\nI believe in superhero\u2019s since the day I could open my eyes. As the year passed my inspiration for the famous superhero Flash has grown over time. Flash has been Favorable to me due to the fact that he was a scientist in his own field in which I\u2019m going to college to study/Major in. Whenever I see or watch Flash I think of myself in a scientific/energetic way of thinking. The flash was a scientist before he was even notice as a hero of the comic books.Prompt: \u201cAdvice you can give to students just starting their high school career\u201d\n\nThere are many advantages of going to high school and staying there for the full time that you should be there. At the same time there are many pitfalls and students can become confuse by the many decisions that we are forced to make. In most cases high school students want to make the best decisions about their future, and so it is important to learn of the various resources available to help make the right decisions as they will make an impact on life after high school.\nThere are many advantages of going to high school. High school will provide you with many opportunities that will help to develop life-long skills such as learning, social and mental development. High school helped me to lay down foundations for growth and development so that I can become a productive and good member of the community. The knowledge presented in high school can help build the necessary foundations for a career you may be interested in. Students can learn various subjects such as business, health, sciences, trades, skills and technology, all of which can be apply to knowledge needed for careers in these fields or other fields. Experiences in high school can also provide you with opportunities for career development. In high school students can meet partners in business, science, technology and other fields and they can learn about these careers and professions from experts in the field. In some high schools, experts come in on career day and talk to the students about the various careers and professions. I always love when they come in. These events can also help students to decide what careers they want to get into when the leave high school.\n\nAnother benefit is that going to high school helps students to build relationships with people such as teachers and other professionals in the fields already. When these professionals come in on career day, students can build professional relationships. You can get the experts as mentors and preceptors in the field. In high school you will also build relationships with each other and agree to go to college together. For me, I have very few friends that I can continue to be friendly with and hopefully go to college with. Some students would go to the same college and enter into the same or similar fields and in doing so long lasting friendly and work career relationships can be created. Another advantage in attending high school is that you get to learn about new methods and new technology in the workplace so that they can be more prepared when they leave school.\n\nThere are many resources in high schools that with help benefit students. High school will prepare students to make better decisions about careers and about colleges where they can advance and go into careers, or further studies that they may want to do. Sometimes, I am not sure what job or profession I want to do after I leave school. The guidance counselors in high school will hopefully help to guide and direct my career paths. Resources such as libraries, career centers, and academies like science academy or technology academy can help me to learn about these specific fields. Schools have resources such as the internet that I can use to learn more about colleges and careers. There are also many resources such as books, brochures and pamphlets that will tell me about careers and colleges.\n\nWhile there are many advantages of going to high school and many resources to guide you, there are just as many pitfalls that can be misleading and dangerous. The large amounts of decisions that confront students can be overwhelming. Students may find pressure to make decisions and may rush into making decisions that they are not comfortable making. You might also rush and make decisions to please your parents. Sometimes I feel like I am being rushed by my mother to make a decision, but I have to remind her that I need to make my mind up. Another pitfall is that students could just be following their friends. Peer pressure could push students to make the wrong decisions for college, or peer pressure may force students to drop out of school. In high school you cannot cave into peer pressure. I had to make a personal decision for myself. High school students must be strong and make decisions best for themselves and their families. Another pitfall in high school is that students may become overwhelm by the many resources offered in school and that may result in the student not making the best and most timely decision.\n\nTo help with the pitfall that may occur in high school, I need to remain positive and seek the resources that will help me to do well and stay in school. Students should go to school and learn the school work. You should also do your homework and ask for help when needed. Students should go to their guidance counselors, or their teachers for additional help when necessary. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable asking for help. You need learn important skills like asking for help, talking with the teachers, being responsible and respecting to the teachers. These simple skills can help you to stay in school, do assignments and home work so you can get good grades, a good grade point average and meet all graduation requirements.\n\nYou should stay in school, so that you can graduate with good grades and then go on to further your education. Failure to remain in high school will result in poor grades, poor skills. If this happens, you will not get good grades, skills or knowledge that will help you to become a good person in the community. Therefore it is important to stay in school, use the resources, avoid the pitfalls and make the best decisions to stay in school.Prompt: Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that has special meaning to you.\n\nGoing to a different elementary school s every year or every other year wasn\u2019t always easy. Living with that transition as a kid wasn\u2019t easy at all to make friends. Events like birthday parties and having people over were always difficult to set up because I didn\u2019t really have a group of base friends that I grew up with. Plus my parents are the type that they have to meet the others kids\u2019 parents for me to even come to a sleepover.\n\nImagine being eight years old , walking into a new elementary school , not knowing a face in the school with butterflies in your stomach wondering how it\u2019s all going to turnout . That was me at least four different times back in my elementary days. I would say the hardest task was to try and fit in. Every day was a new challenge to face because everyone knew each other and it was like I was the only crumbled cookie in a fresh new pack of opened Oreos. My teacher did try and make it better by doing all the introductions and trying to fit me in but I was still the odd ball in the pack. Plus as a kid was very timid, some would say anti-social, so that definitely didn\u2019t help me. Honestly sometimes I even tried not to make friends because I knew I was going to end up moving.Prompt: Greatest challenge I have ever faced\n\nMoving away from the place I was raised in and lived the most of my life was very hard for me and my family. It was scary, but at the same time it\u2019s exciting to explore the new beginning of our life. My mind was thinking that if I move away from all my loved one and friends, I won\u2019t be able to see them again and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to make any new friends in United States.\n\nAfter living in the Philippines for almostPrompt: \u201cDiscuss what makes you uniquely qualified for college\u201d\n\nCollege is the next essential step; it is also the most talked about after you finish high school. The reason college is known for being so hard is because high school graduates don\u2019t really know what they want to be. People their age rarely know what they want to be. Myself I have spent countless hours discovering what I would like to accomplish. Anyone can say they want to do something; it takes some drive and execution to pursue something you enjoy. There are many cases where I could have quit and people would have loved to see me fail. At the end of all that I just had to remember why I was doing it, and was it worth fighting for. To prove them wrong I work hard for whatever it took a months or years. I just had to stay determined and put all my essential qualities to use.\n\nHigh School is a rough time for some students. Students are figuring out what they want to become and finding out who they are. 50% \u2013 70% of students change their majors at least once; most will change majors at least 3 times before they graduate. Not only knowing what you want to do is important, finding out whom you are necessary as well. Why is this important as a college student? Many students when they get to college don\u2019t have the hard work and will power to continue. Students don\u2019t know what works for them to be successful. I have spent many methods on how to plan and make myself successful.\n\nSomeone once told me that they\u2019re a difference between listening and learning. Anyone can listen but only some can learn. It is the same concept on having idea/dream, and someone who peruses their aspirations. I had teachers before that told me that \u201cYou would not go anywhere\u201d. The only thing the teachers didn\u2019t know was I did not take their \u201cadvice\u201d into consideration. I kept myself from going the wrong way. The steps I took were I did all I could do, and if I was failing behind I made up the work. I continuing doing well and showed my teachers wrong. I could have quit and not cared but I was motivated because I had a goal to achieve.\n\nHard work over weights anything I notice that hard work is like practice. Everyone knows the saying that \u201cPractice makes perfect\u201d. No matter how bad you are at something the amount of time I\u2019ve practice takes an effect. I have put so much hard work into school. That I\u2019m ready for a new challenge college is that next step. I have prepared my whole life to get this opportunity. With all the knowledge I have learn from preparing and my high school practice college I am ready for college.\n\nWith all the things I have learned during my school years and my life lessons. I have learn a lot of new thing and will look forward to learning new things in college.Prompt: \u201cDescribe an important transition in your life\u201d\n\nIt was my first year of high school. I was excited and nervous at the same time I was excited because it was a new beginning for me. It what significant to me because it was a big change for me. I was going from middle school to high school.\n\nThe alarm goes off it is now 5:00 a.m. it is time for me to get ready for school. I get off my bed and go brush my teeth then go into in to the shower. The water was freezing cold. When I got out the shower I rushed to my room and start getting ready. The time flew by so quickly. I got ready on time. I had few minutes before I had to go to the bus stop. I ate some cereal before leaving. Once, I left to bus stop I was walking with my sister. I arrived at the bus stop it was near the road where the cars were passing. The wind was blowing in my face because of the cars racing in the road. I could see the red lights flashing on the bus. The bus is getting near I start shaking and my hands are getting sweaty. I get on the bus and it feels as if I was walking into an oven it was hot.\n\nFurthermore, we are getting near the school and I get afraid. I don\u2019t know what is it like to be in high school and it will be a new experience for me. We finally arrive at school. There are many buses there also. Suddenly, they yell out \u201cunload\u201d when they say that it means to open the door and let us out of the bus. Everyone starts rushing off the bus and I am patiently waiting for my turn. I get off the bus and start walking into the school. I walk in the school and there are lots of people. I am squeezing in between the crowd. I finally walk through everyone and it is time to look for my classes. I think to myself I don\u2019t know where my classes are the good thing is that there were teachers in mostly each corner. I got to all my classes. I would look around to see if I had any friends in that class. Luckily, I had at least one friend in each class. I just wanted the day to be over as soon as possible. The thing that got me nervous was that my sister would always tell me, \u201chigh school is not easy.\u201d The first day isn\u2019t that bad because the only thing we do is get informed of what we will expect and our expectations and what we will learn during the year.\n\nAdditionally, for me the transition from middle school to high school was a big change for me. The reason being is because I was already getting use to walking up later like around 7:00 a.m. Then, the following year having to wake up at 5:00 a.m. was a change. I had to get use to waking up at that time. It was hard because the first days I would wake up at the right time then, I would go back to sleep. I missed the bus a few times. I managed to get over that with time. The only thing I didn\u2019t like is that I had seven classes. The other thing was that the classes were very apart from each other. For example, I had to walk from one building to another one in five minutes. Overall, I liked all my classes. For me high school was easy as long as I did my work. They start getting us ready for college.Prompt: \u201cDiscuss the greatest challenge you have face or expect to face\u201d\n\nChallenge? What is a challenge? It\u2019s something that you have to accomplish or something you have to face. Well everyone has challenges. Small ones, big ones but I never thought I would face the biggest one ever. That is my dad death. I had no idea it was going to happen that fast. So that\u2019s the biggest challenge I have to face in my life. It was so unexpected I have to face. My life has change since that day.\n\nIt began on June 30, 2014 that afternoon. I was hanging out with my friend Stefany. It was a great day. She left to go home. I went inside to my room. Then my mom got a call from my aunt. She told her that my dad had passed away. She came to my room. She told me and my sister that my dad has passed away. When I heard the bad news tears where rolling down my face. I had to call my older brother to tell him the news. He answers and when I told him. He was like your lying I\u2019m like no I\u2019m not. It was grandma all over. We went to see him in the hospital. It was the hardest thing I have to face to see. I almost fell to the ground and one of my aunts caught me. All the family was full of sadness and we couldn\u2019t accept it. Later on that week it was his funeral. It was on Wednesday July 2, 2014. In the memorial service we were crying our tears out. When my family saw him it was horrible that we have to see him like that. During the service the ladies sung this song call \u201cYo Te Extranare\u201d which it means I\u2019ll miss you. That song is a dialogue of me and my dad talking. Every time listen to that song I always cry and be in pain, because it reminds me of him. Ever since the funeral nothing would make be happy.\n\nOn that Saturday that week. We had this church event which took place in the park that my dad would always take me. That was also the park behind where my grandma and dad work. That day memories just came to me and tears came out too. So I walk around and cry my eyes out. When I was walking around. My mom was telling the people from church that my dad died that week. And she also told them that I was the most effected about it. Anyways ever since my dad passed away my life change a lot. All my friends ask me how you can live life still without your dad. I\u2019m like I just don\u2019t think about as much. Ever since then I haven\u2019t been the same girl that I used to be. My religious beliefs change and so has my personalities. I\u2019ve suffering for my dad death and for something else I can\u2019t say. Every time I\u2019m going somewhere. Something always reminds me of him and my memories come back. Oh also when I go to my grandpa house. I always think my dad is going to be there even though I should know he\u2019s not there. I just can\u2019t accept that he\u2019s gone. My family and my friends say \u201cIt\u2019s okay [...] your dad is now in peace and not suffering\u201d. I\u2019m like \u201cNo now I\u2019m the one suffering \u201c. I wanted him to see me graduate and see I made it. He saw my brother graduate and now he won\u2019t see me. He would always tell me when he was here. \u201cYa me voy a morir\u201d Which means I\u2019m going to die. I hated that he would always say that. I would tell him \u201cPa no tengas eso\u201d which means \u201cDad don\u2019t say that\u201d. So my life has complete became a suffering life.\nAs can be seen life is so short. I want to live my life. Since my dad is no longer here I want him to know I\u2019m doing everything so I would be successful. I want to become a writer, singer, and also an actress. He\u2019s the only person that supported me on what I wanted to do with my life. So when I become one of those dreams of mine. I own it all to my dad. He made me what I am now and I want to accomplish everything I need to do. Now I\u2019m not suffering as much for his death because I know he\u2019s not suffering. And soon I would be with him. So this was the greatest challenge I have to face and still facing.Prompt: What are the three specific things you plan to do in Florida?\n\nThe three specific things I plan to do at Florida is focusing on class, basketball, and wanting on to become a more responsible person. I want to build the best educate for me. Be known as one of the best student \u2013athlete who came to Florida State. To be known to teachers on my skills of focus. To be remember as an elite player that played the game. To be one of the best player on and off the court.\n\nMy focus is coming to Florida with a good mindset. My study habits would be up to par while in the hot steaming room with no A/C. my sweat would fall off my forehead like bullet shells. As I try to write a perfect paper. As I am proof reading the paper for the professor to receive the fulfilling grade of success.\n\nAs I\u2019m done with my work for class I head to the gym with coach and the guys. As we practice on our plays for the games. While me and the team breathe hard with exhaustion. The coaches would let us take a break and drink a cold bottle of Gatorade. While we drink and take a break we discussed about getting the sunny beach college sate a championship.\n\nAs we end practice I\u2019ll go off campus to go work and find a way to stay productive. To stay on the right path and let others go on the wrong. As I drive on the smooth road with the bright glowing sun hits my face. I would go out to find a job and make some more money to pay for books and food to live on. Then after work I\u2019ll go to the donation and give the clothes that I don\u2019t wear any more. I would clean up the streets of Florida to help the community out with a place to claim for good and clean areas.Prompt: Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that has a special meaning to you.\n\nMany people have achieved different things in their lives. Some have achieved to get scholarships. Other where able to go pro in a sport they loved. There are a lot of achievements that people have been able to accomplish. A significant experience or achievement that has a special meaning to me is when I made it to Varsity Cross-Country.\n\nThe first time that I joined Cross-Country I saw that there were many good runners. That inspired me to try to be the best runner for the team. I attended practice every day and gave it all I had. But one of my biggest obstacles that was stopping me from being the best was my knee pain. My knee pain was really bad and that was slowing me down big time. Therefore my sophomore season wasn\u2019t the best; I wasn\u2019t able to become the best runner for Berkmar.\n\nAfter I did therapy for my knee and I relaxed my joins I went back to running. But this time I did something different that I dint do the first time, I went to summer conditioning. Summer conditioning helped me out big time to become better and achieve my goal. I ran all summer long with the team; luckily I wasn\u2019t having any knee pain. After summer conditioning finished our Cross-Country season started again. I was determined to achieve my goal that year. Two weeks into the season and we had our first race of the year. After getting an 18:29 for a 3.1 mile race I knew I was on track to achieving my goal. I kept working hard to get even better and by the time you know it I was top varsity for Berkmar High School. I finished that year with my best time of 17:52.\n\nThis year I am setting a new goal. That goal is to beat my personal record that I set last year. I\u2019m going to put even more work in and I\u2019m going to try more hard to achieve that goal. I know that I focus on my goal I\u2019ll be able to reach it. The goal I am setting for this season it to run a 17:00 flat or less if possible.\n\nMy main goal that I had was been to become a varsity runner. That goal has been accomplished, now I have to set new goals so I can keep making accomplishments in life. A new goal I have is to beat my personal record of 17:52 and hopefully get a Cross-Country scholarship. Overall the achievement that has a special meaning to me is the fact I was able to become varsity for Berkmar High School.Prompt: \u201dEvaluate a significant experience or achievement that that has special meaning to you.\u201d\n\nOne of the greatest achievements is to graduate and fulfill all the dreams and goals that I have set for myself. This world is full of people that had set goals, and dreams but never did anything to make them come true. I don\u2019t want to be one more of those people that don\u2019t do anything to not make them; I will do whatever it takes just to make it happen. I want these not only for myself but I part for my family. They have been there sense day one and I appreciate all their support.\n\nWhy do I say that I don\u2019t only want it for me but for my family? Because, my family has been there for me without thinking about it twice, they have had my back, no matter what they will always be there. They push me to do my very best all the time, and tell me every time that I should never stop fighting for what I want, if I want it to go for it. Even when the get too pushy and very stressful I know they don\u2019t do it to frustrate me they do it because they care and want me to do good in life and even though I feel like they pressure me sometimes I know it\u2019s because they care.\n\nBy me graduating and entering college, would be the best achievement ever not only because I prove myself that I could do but because I would be making my mom prude, and for all of those people that didn\u2019t have faith in me or never believe that I could have done it. I want to give the best I have and be successful. My mother is one thing that push me the most to do good, and I want to make her proud and show her that I can do it, and by that I will be giving her back a little out of all that she has gave me.\n\nThat is the main achievement that I have in mind, the one that is going to take me far in life the one that I\u2019m going to be proud to say that I made it and that I did it all by myself, with hard effort but I made it. Everybody is born with a purpose in life, I know mine. Now the only thing I have left is to get to it and do anything it takes to get it done.Think of a place you know well. Describe the place and include feelings about it.\n\nHave you ever wanted to go back in time, and visit that one place that brings a smile to your face? Meanwhile that exact place is so far from your reach, and on the other hand it\u2019s extremely close to your heart. When I think of that place I only imagine Guatemala. There are three areas in Guatemala that I enjoy tremendously which are in some ways very different and similar at the same time.\nVenecia, Guatemala is one of these areas that I adore to stay at. Primarily I\u2019m fondled at the fact that my mom was born around this district. Also her parents and my grandparents still live there to this day. Every time I go spend time over there I fancy walking through the high stalks of green corn and getting lost for hours with my little cousin Yasmin. Another thing I\u2019m delighted by is the morning breeze hugging my skin so tight that goose bumps appear throughout by body. Evenings were even better; my grandmother would stir up a cup of coco for my sister and me and included bread on the side to make the experience even more outstanding. I won\u2019t ever forget the time when my sister and I put ten baby chicks in a circle and surrounded them with something. After a few seconds we would lift that something and the chicks would run in every direction. The place was to collect each one of the chicks until we got ten again. This specific moment made me feel butterflies and fireworks inside my tummy. Every single time I go to visit the moment is extremely pleasant and unforgettable. My heart speeds up every time I am able to go to Guatemala.\n\nAnother place I\u2019m exited in Guatemala to spend time at is chela. Chela is located near the city. It\u2019s three hours from the city but a hot sweaty three hours in the car. My mom\u2019s little brother Rudy lives there in a two story home. I love going there because I get to share moments with my baby cousin. I remember once my brother, sister and I went to a water park like thirty minutes away. My eyes almost popped out of my head once I saw the price of each ticket. Each one of us had to pay one hundred quetzals, which is the name of the currency in Guatemala. In U.S currency it would vary from fourteen to fifteen dollars. The money didn\u2019t really bother me at the end of the day. I saw huge slide with people shouting and screaming. The one ride that is unforgettable to me was the one where all three of us got into one float and were pushed in a giant swirling slide and we at got wet and at the end of the slide was a pool where we fell into. My heart was racing the entire time we were there. After the water park we headed back to my uncle\u2019s house where we ate a fish that was whole and looking at me. This started to make my stomach to move from the smile on my face. After a few weeks my other grandparents, my dad\u2019s parents came to pick my sister and I up to go stay with them until the day we had to come back to Georgia.\n\nMy father\u2019s parents live the closest to the city. Its one and a half hours away. The interesting part of Chimaltenango, Guatemala is that it\u2019s always mid-warm there and I love the sun beating against my skin. I adore helping out in my grandfather\u2019s store where he basically sells everybody\u2019s needs. The benefit of being his granddaughter was that I basically owned his store as well. What I mean by that was I could take anything and pig out on whatever I craved. Luckily that wasn\u2019t the only thing to do at their house. At times I would help my grandma water all her crops such as bananas,plantans,mangosPrompt: A person that who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nThey say \u2018Never Judge A book by Its Cover \u201c, but why does everyone still judge me because of the carrier I want to take or the job I would love to have. People are always telling me what to do and what is best for me, but I don\u2019t want what happen to my cousin happening to me. I really want to be a doctor\u2019s assistants and I will be because I have the skills for it.\n\nMy cousin always wanted to travel the world, but her parents never let her do what she wanted to do with her life, since they were the ones who were paying her college and her books. People and family members would always judge her because they thought she would never get to that level since most of us were poor. She knew that one day she was going to be traveling to many countries, and luckily the United States government sent a letter to her school asking for a voluntary helper to go to out the country and help others. When everyone doubt it her, she always believed in herself.\n\nFrom the time I was able to realize that the U.C (University Of California) was the best for me and my future, I decide to do my research on it.2nd PeriodPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nThrough out the good and the bad and the ugly she has been there. When i was sick feeling like i was on my death bed,she was there. When i just plainly need someone to talk to or a friend she was always there. That person is my mom. My mother has made the greatest influence on my life out of everyone i have know to this day. Throughout all the struggle she, me and my family as a whole she has been there and she was the one to keep it all together and kept a smile on her face even when she felt like she could just leave ,she stayed and fought through it all. She was my mother.\n\nMy moms name is Yezzet Lewis Thomas. She is a Licensed Practical Nurses or LPN and she is working on her RN degree (Registered Nurses). Born in France moved to the United States when she was 2 and has 9 brothers and sisters her family was a military family with her dad serving in the military. One reason i chose her to be my biggest influence on me is the fact she was always there for me. when i was younger from Elementary to Middle school I had a really hard time making friends and had lots of issues with me being bullied and my constant stutter did not make it any better from my point of view, It just gave others more ammo to fire at me day after day and i struggled with life. But i always knew i could come home and wait to 8 o'clock the time she gets off of work and just talk to her about it like she was my best friend. She was always on my side and when i needed stuff done school wise she would stay up late to help me even if she had to go back to work at 6 in the AM.Describe an important transition in your life.\n\nMy name was not called to participate in the 2014-2015 Peachtree Ridge, three day soccer tryouts. The coach said, \u201cwe do not have your physical on file\u201d, but yet I turned mine in to the lady soccer adviser and she said she will put it in the day I gave it to her a week before. The JV coach told me to ask Coach Sutton, the Varsity coach, to see if I can still tryout. When I walked over to him, and informed him on the situation, he looked me up and down looking at how I was dressed, I am new to the soccer world so I had some; black vans, shorts and two hoodies on, that day was the day it started to snow, and he said, \u201cwell if it is not on file then I will not let you tryout.\u201d I was outside for hours just practicing in the cold after school, from 2:10 to 5:00.\nBeing told in front of the whole soccer team and new comers, that you can\u2019t tryout, is embarrassing, and it really hurts you. I knew I turned in my Physical Form but they \u201cdid not have it\u201d. Later on that day of the tryouts, my mom emailed Coach Sutton, and informed him that I did turn it in to the Soccer Lady. So the Coach replies saying that I am able to come to the second day tryout and I will be evaluated closely during the tryout. I told my mom no, I will not go to the tryout because I will feel the pressure and know they are watching me closely, I also did not want not meet their standers and still not make the team. Plus, I did not have much experience to the game of soccer, so I thought it would be best of me to not go and work on my skills for the game till next year.\n\nSo from the day after the second tryout, I was practicing soccer left and right, outside working on ball control, my touches, juggling, and at parks working on my shooting. I have improved a lot from the tryouts. I am glad that I decided to go off and improve my skills, I am more confident to tryout now, but still will be nervous and feel the pressure. I moved schools my last year of high school, to Berkmar High school and I am trying out this year, I will be attending Conditioning, did not do it at Peachtree Ridge, but I will now. Seniors have to try out for Varsity and juniors too and then sophomores and freshman have to try out for JV. So I will be preparing myself for Varsity tryouts, and the Varsity Coach, is also my Psychology teacher. He knows I am trying out for soccer and has been informing me the updates on soccer. I got my physical done and now I am just getting myself ready for conditioning.\n\nMy future career goals with soccer, is to make it to an MLS (Major League Soccer) Team. MLS is only teams held in The United States, so American Teams. I have a few teams in mind, for example; Orlando FC, New York City, New York City Red Bulls and LA Galaxy. In 2017, Georgia will have their own MLS team, I would like to try them out first.\n\nSo ever since that day after tryouts, I have opened my mind to soccer, learned more about soccer and would to take it up a notch in my life. I may not be much good but all I can do from then and to the future is practice.Prompt: Discuss What Makes You Uniquely qualified for This Position\n\nNot everyone is qualified for every job or career. I know I have the potential to be a police officer. Wearing the blue is not the easiest or most popular position right now but I am motivated to do it. Having the dream is the first step to a goal. However, having certain capabilities is also key to success in performing specific tasks. I am very perceptive so I can notice elements that are out of the ordinary that may disrupt society and I also possess a sense of justice to act out this role. I can see myself right now in the uniform and looking out across the street.\nPerception is a necessary skill for all law enforcement. Without it, criminals would continue to wreak havoc and no one will be any the wiser. If a situation seems off, I will notice. I know the symptoms of being under the influence of hard drugs: drowsiness, hyperactivity, sweating, irritability, paranoia. Liars will not fool me either. I will note the delay and uncertainty in a person\u2019s response and the many gestures that accompany deceit. Then I will politely ask for the truth. There is another sense that is required for this position.\n\nA sense of justice is a key component to upholding the law. The privilege of safeguarding other people can corrupt. Many act as if they are the rulers of the land but I would consider myself a servant of society. Abusing power is unthinkable to me. There are government workers who accept bribes and practice favoritism. I would treat all citizens as equals, not favoring the rich, a gender, or any particular ethnicity. This country is founded on principles of equality and should be enforced by only the fair-minded.\n\nProfessions require a certain set of skills. Applicants that want to be police officers are weeded out first for the incapable. I have astute skills to notice illegal and abnormal activities and I also have a clear sense of justice. I know I will pass the training and perform well in the field. In the not too distant future, I will assist in keeping the country, the city, the people in uniform.Prompt: ?\nI was born in Guatemala. When I was about five years old my mother contacted some people and I\u2019ve lived in Georgia ever since. Growing up was a real struggle. Bills were paid late, sometimes there was no dinner for me and my siblings, and eventually we would relocate to a different apartment. This happened several times until money was no longer an issue and we moved into a humble house.\nMy brother had it the worst out of the three kids my mom had. There was always the language barrier, but he was lucky since the school actually bumped him up a grade. Even with all the stress he managed to graduate. My sister was a total different story, however. Greilyn was always involved in extracurricular activities, and throughout her high school years she had at least one Advanced Placement class. She would juggle sleep, homework, sports, and after school clubs all at once. She wasn\u2019t able to attend college because she didn\u2019t have legal papers at that time. My brother, my sister and I were able to get a worker\u2019s permit two years ago and my sister and brother were able to get a stable job. Both Heber and Greilyn moved to Florida, my brother with his wife and my sister with her husband.\n\nFamily problems arose back at home. When I was in seventh grade I started to miss a lot of days in school. Some teachers told me I wouldn\u2019t get anywhere in life and that\u2019s where I stopped caring about anything that had to deal with school. This was when life knocked the teeth straight out of my mouth. I would have mental breakdowns time after time. In the 10th grade, I barely passed the first semester and I failed four classes the second. When I got to my junior year in high school I realized how important school really was and I made a life plan to become a mechanical engineer.\nI moved to Florida with my sister for the first semester of 11th grade and that\u2019s where I recovered my lost credits. I went from taking advanced classes to standard classes in less than a year. I didn\u2019t give up there and I\u2019m still here standing. I know my story is merely one of thousands, but nothing would mean more to me than being the first in my family to go to college and prove to myself that I am no failure. I have always believed that one cannot get back up if they have never fallen. I\u2019m grabbing life by the horns and taming the raging beast. This is only the beginning, for one day I will also prove the world, and those who doubted me, that I [...] am a successful college graduate.As the window bust from the hard wind I Can feel the the heat rise as the flames spread extremely rapidly from the garage to the living room. The flames started in the garage it was caused by the wires in the walls the Fire department said it was an electrical fire. I can remember the harsh smell of wood burning that made my stomach ache. The heat of the fire felt liked when you open the oven after a long time of preheating. One of My Greatest challenges that I faces was my house burning to the ground in the spring of 2007. This experience Changed my life completely it showed me things about family and friends, Showed me to Value things more, but it also made life harder.\nIt was 11:48Pm on a Wednesday night everybody was asleep except my brother he was up watching TV when he notice a burning smell coming from down stairs, he rushed to see where it was coming from when he notice the garage was in flames, He run upstairs panicking to wake everybody up. Once he thought everybody was up the flames was already spreading more and more. As we try and put on our shoes we hear window bursting one by one. We all rushed towards the front door were you could barely see anything because the house was filled with black smoke, as I inhaled the smoke I remember getting lite headed jumping out the fire. Then once everybody was out we notice my baby brother didn\u2019t make it out. The fire man said it was too risky for anybody to go back in the house, even the fire marshal gave up on him. My older brother wasn\u2019t going for it he broke loose from the fire man and ran fast thru the back yard to the back door and up the stairs as he heard my brother scream for help. He yells to my brother to just roll down the stairs. He rolls down the stairs and he and my baby brother jumped out the house together as soon as they jumped out the whole entire house collapse. My brother had 3rd degree burns in many places. They Fire department called him a miracle because they never seen somebody make it out a house like that. My family lost everything, 5 dogs all our clothes shoes furniture and pictures everything. At the end of the night we were placed in a hotel for those whom didn\u2019t have a house. We stayed in a hotel for about 2 months until we finally moved back to Chicago for 2 months to stay with my grandma.\n\nAfter the fire everything was different crying myself to sleep every night waking up in tears having nightmares of that night, I felt like I was reliving it all over again night by night, Not going to school every day because we had no clothes or shoes. When my house burnt down I left my best friend she stayed in that neighborhood she was the only person to know and understand. At that time I didn\u2019t care about school at all. Going to school and people asking about was the worst. People making fun of me because I didn\u2019t have a house I hated school just because of that. Nobody could understand what I was going thru at a young age. Moving from hotel to hotel school to school I went to 5 different elementary schools a different school every year. Having to make new friends every year was hard being insecure of my situation to tell people was the hardest. I used to go to school just to go not even caring about it. Until my 5th grade year and I meet this teacher who was so cooled and I could talk to her bout everything and she made me realize school is what I need. She taught me I can just write my hurt and my problems out with poetry or just start writing when I\u2019m upset.\n\nAs time moved on things started getting better, we started getting our life back together. Started building a home back together getting everything back to normal, even though it was hard and we struggled but my mom always managed to get it done. We noticed family wasn\u2019t always there for you when you need them. It was us by ourselves against everything all the problems with no help, even my mom mother wasn\u2019t there after time went back. It showed us life can be gone in a blink of an eye. After that it made us stronger and closer as a family. It made us strive harder to get everything we wanted and once had because we lost it all in one night. It showed me that I need an education to be successful in order to get everything I want.Prompt: The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?\n\nHigh school is a great stepping ground for young adults to experience responsibility, freedom and to prepare themselves for college and the work field. Everyone makes mistakes but it\u2019s up to you to correct them and better the situation.\n\nHaving responsibilities is a huge thing to have. You always have to stay focused and on top of things. My freshmen year in high school I failed second semester Biology. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to be able to make it up so that I could still graduate on time and have a good college look at me. I went to my counselor to ask her about any programs that the school offered for kids that failed classes. She offered me a chance to do a afterschool program called Credit Recovery. The program was $100 for two weeks and class was 3 hours long. Having to do Credit Recovery for those two weeks I still had to say on top of doing my classwork for school and working. Me failing Biology set me back but also made me realize how much school Is important to me and just how badly I wanted stay focused and do the right thing.\n\nFreedom can help or set you back in life, it\u2019s up to you to keep everything in order and to still do what you\u2019re supposed to do. For example wanting to go out with your friends, instead of studying for a quiz. I honestly thinkPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nFrom a young age my grandparents were always on my butt to go in a straight line, to stay focus, and to never do something I would regret in the future. My grandparents always had a huge influence in my life. To this day I can never be any more grateful to have them. The example they set is the example I want to set to the lower classmen.\n\nFrom 5 in the morning to 6 afternoons, Monday thru Friday they would come with tiredness written all over their face. Just knowing they\u2019re busting their butts just so I can go to school and knowing I don\u2019t have to worry about anything. Because of them I want to strive for success, I want to be someone with a doctor\u2019s degree or a business degree, just something that they could be proud of. I was given an opportunity that wasn\u2019t given to my grandparents and that was an education.\n\nI\u2019ve face situations where dropping out was the easy way out, but why quit when I\u2019m so close to getting a diploma, why quit on something my grandparents would be so happy about, why let them down, why not graduate so they can tell their friends and family that they raised a successful kid, a kid that didn\u2019t give up. My grandparents would tell me \u201c if you want to be successful go for it, we would be by your side; nothing stopping you from being someone important in life.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s my senior year and its crazy to think that I made it this far, I\u2019m the only one in my family that\u2019s about to graduate, I\u2019m breaking a curse that\u2019s been in my family for generations. My grandparents are the reason for me to finish my education. Every day I would get lectured about what kind of life I would have if I don\u2019t finish high school, I don\u2019t want to be behind a lawn mower working 11 hours a day in the heat. Having an education open so many doors for different opportunities in the future.Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face\n\nEveryone has a challenge that they expect to face. My greatest challenge that I expect to face is going to college and being successful in the future. Those are my greatest challenge because it is not going to be easy. I am going to have to put a lot of effort and not mess up. Once you mess up it is very hard to get back up, and since it is about your future than it is very important to not make that mistake.\n\nIt is not going to be easy because colleges do not just accept anybody. They require much information such as the SAT or the ACT. Which are a test that every college requires, and you have to meet the average point or above. Also a certain point of GPA and above, resume and other important requirements. College is the real thing, it is more freedom and that is where you already know what you want to do in life. You have your mind set on your career and at that moment you already know what you should do and expect to do.\n\nTo be successful in my future I have to do something I enjoy doing and that gets me good money for it. I want to do entrepreneur, because I want to have my own business. I do not like it when people boss me around. Therefor if I study entrepreneur I would be the one bossing people around and they would work for me. I enjoy that because it something I like to do and I have always wanted to have my own business. In college I want to study entrepreneur, but it would not be easy. Even though it would not be easy I would not give up, it would be a great challenge for me.\n\nCollege is the time to get your things together and start working extra hard. It is not going to be easy but one should not give up. It would be extremely stressful and hard but that is just how college is. I am the type of person that gets distracted easily so I paying attention in college with no distractions would be a challenge. I would have to set up goals and learn how to accomplish each one of them. When you set up goals you have to be determined and find a way to achieve them. It is a lot to do but it is something I expect to face.Prompt: The greatest challenge I am expected to face.\n\nAs a child I had almost everything handed to me. What I would ask for I received, I had six pets for crying out loud. As time prevailed getting what I wanted when I wanted wasn\u2019t so easy anymore. Now it\u2019s my last year of high school and it could not be any more stressful than it is now.\nIt\u2019s the last first day of high school I am struck with \u201csenioritis\u201d as soon as I walk through those double doors. Saying to myself \u201cI can\u2019t wait to graduate and get this year over with\u201d. By May all of this will be over and I\u2019ll be left to my own devices, by May all my friends would have moved on ,and I\u2019ll be stuck thinking to my self what\u2019s next? By May my time would be upPrompt: Discuss a place that has changed you.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame how few people choose not to go to college. I plan on going to college and have a bright future. One particular school I\u2019ve been seeking is Morehouse. I plan on attending a school with a positive environment and fair rules. I have learned unique history and facts about the school as well.\n\nNot too long ago I visited Morehouse College my sophomore year. I was in this mentoring program called BEAMERS we went on a field trip to visit the school. This experience changed me. I remember stepping off that rusty bus into the quiet school. The halls were silent and echoed every step you took. The lunch room smelled like a 5-star restaurant. I said to myself: \u201cI\u2019d love to attend this school\u201d.\n\nAs soon as we made it to the college we sat in a class room then talked to a student that attends Morehouse. He told us the GPA requirements, which was a 3.7 at the time. He explained Morehouse is a private, four-year, historically black college. We were also informed that Morehouse was an all-male school. This statement was a shock to many including myself. The crazy thing was Spelman College was right across the street from Morehouse. Spellman was an all-female school. The student informed us with much information about the school but our tour was nowhere finished.\n\nThe best part about our tour was coming up next. The student informed us with unique history of the school. There is an obelisk named in honor of Howard Thurman. Thurman was an African American author, philosopher, theologian, educator and civil rights leader. He was a graduate of Morehouse College. There were many other celebrities that graduated from this school such as Spike Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Martin Luther King Jr. Martin Luther King was enrolled at more at the age of 15 after skipping the 9th & 12th grade. These unique facts went on and on like a broken record.\n\nEver since the Morehouse tour I\u2019ve never been the same. I met the requirements to this college. I would be more than happy to attend it. I hope ever school high school gets to tour this college. It is truly a life changing experience.Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face.\n\nThroughout my entire life challenges have been with me from the beginning. No matter what I have faced challenges and been expecting to face more that are thrown my way. Without dealing with these situations in life I don\u2019t think I would be as successful as I am now. Challenges to me are basically things to where I have to push myself in order to go where I want to go. Plus learning how to never give up and stay at the task at hand.\n\nThe greatest challenge I expect to face in life is getting my mom and brother a bigger house and a better lifestyle for them. I really expect to do all that through basketball as a matter of fact and I have a great feeling that I will be able to accomplish this as well. Basketball is really my wife in this world because I have become so phenomenal at it that I have been attending colleges and camps. The only reason for me even wanting to play is because my little brother looks up to me and he wants to see me make it big for the family. In the future as I finish up high school, I expect to have matured well enough to be ready for college and hoping that I will be succeeding in that as well. I already know that for me challenges will forever come my way but as a humble human being I will never complain. I\u2019m going to always push myself to get better at what I love and loving something I always wanted to do.\n\nThe other challenge I expect to face is trying to find the college that\u2019s right for me and depending on how great of a school they are education wise and activity wise. I have visited colleges any basketball or any other athlete can ever dream of. My recent visits have been North Carolina or UNC, Kentucky, Birmingham Southern, Georgia State, FAMU, Florida State University, Georgia State, Louisville, Georgia Tech, University of Georgia, and that\u2019s pretty much it. For me visiting those schools it took a lot of hard work to get there and that\u2019s not even including sports wise really. Those colleges expect major things from kids attending, and I can get really lazy so it will take me some time to bypass all of that. A college I was really considering going to was Florida State University. With that being a highly attended school in the country they acquire kids to be outstanding scholars. For me to get in there I have to do exceptionally well in high school as of now since I\u2019m a senior. Because if I didn\u2019t loiter around in my freshman and sophomore year, I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about much as a senior. But that is a challenge I am facing at this moment and I know I can overcome it. Especially knowing people are here to support me as I continue on with the success I\u2019m at I know I\u2019ll be okay.\n\nThat is really the greatest challenge I have faced in my life because there were days to where I just wanted to give up and stop playing basketball all together. But I had to come to my intellectual gift and do what I what destined to do as my heart desired. Another Challenge I expect to face is overcoming my laziness and putting forth the effort as I am told to do so. But I have overcome that already but if I want to get in a successful college at this moment of life I got to just get through it. Another college I was looking forward to coming to see was Tennessee. I wanted to consider them on my list because their high school requirements aren\u2019t as major as Kentucky and so on. But it will still be a big obstacle for me to get into. Plus their courses have to meet my needs because I wouldn\u2019t want to attend if they aren\u2019t as good as I thought. But there are a lot of athletes in my shoes and especially professional athletes as a matter of fact. So really it doesn\u2019t bother me knowing I have to face a colossal obstacle at hand.Prompt: ?\n\nThe high way a never ending sees of concrete and steel. My hands dire and tit on the old polished letter wheal my first day on the road. I stop pull over and scream not in anguish but it in nervous excitement over my future I was going to university to some no surprise to others dis belief. My interest confused and angered my friends and some family I wanted to become a geneticist something never herd of by my pears. Growing up in Canada theirs a wall much greater than in the states not racial not nationalist theirs was a learning wall my wall from the time I could remember I had trouble with words not on the page but in my mind. I could read and understand words with the best of them but the second I was told to write my mind went a blank not with ideas but in how I could put them on paper I couldn\u2019t spell. I was put in to \u201cspecial education\u201d or prison school for short I was hindered broken not rite my self-esteem was crashed and my life in question I was lost.

This was my chance to prove myself I was accepted in to a recover program where you are put in to regular classes but have a counselor.\n\nIn middle school my science and history classes I could sleep in class and if she asked me a question, I would keep my head flat on the desk and answer every question correctly quizzes and tests no problem 100 all day long. Till I got to high school my teacher asked me to write an essay I was terrified so I wrote as little as possible, I was steaming I couldn\u2019t write what I wanted the things floating in my head I couldn\u2019t get them out. Meany years pass I slowly but Shirley made my way to AP classes my writing improved and but compared to my AP classmates I was far from them but I\u2019m getting better every day.\n\n\u201clife is hard it will beat you down if you let it but it\u2019s not about how hard you hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep going \u201c Rock 4 life will never be easy I learned this form a young age but thing that seem hard for some might not be for others. Wrestling was never a hard thing for me ya there where hard practices but its temporary it\u2019s, better to work hard and get your hand razed then to playing around then to be on your back gasping for air. If you\u2019ve wrestled with something, your whole life wrestling for 6 minutes is easy. So many people ask me is it hard is it hard it\u2019s not about weather its hard it about whether it\u2019s worth it, university is no different just another opponent I haft to wrestle agents but before we step in the ring I\u2019m just letting you know university compared to my previous opponents is just a bump in the high way of life.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nMy parents are the ones that have made me who I am. They are the reason to why I am in school. Thanks to them I want to do my best and become someone in life. Each one of them had their own part in order for me and my brother to get here.\n\nMy mom, she has worked really hard since the time she got here in order to bring my older brother and me here. She has always given us what we wanted and works hard for it. She has two jobs morning and afternoon. She leaves at 7am and comes home at 11pm from her second job. Sometimes my brothers and I don\u2019t see her the whole day. We would have to say up in order to see her and when she has off.\n\nShe tries to hang out with us When she doesn\u2019t work she would take us to the park or anywhere we want. Somehow she always finds a way to spend time with us even though she might be tired. She did her best for me now it\u2019s my turn to do my best for her and give her the life she deserves. Furthermore my father has always been there for us and gives us what we need.\n\nMy father on the other hand has only one job. He works in the morning and comes home at 4pm. Somehow he finds a way to pay bills send money to my family In Mexico and have some left to give to us so we can buy what we want. He would give us advice to keep moving forward to not give up and to go for our dreams. All my father wants is for us to be happy and get education. He wasn\u2019t given the opportunity to go to school and be someone in life, but even though he didn\u2019t go to school he is very smart. Now it\u2019s up to me to give them the life they deserve.\n\nEnd Second PeriodFifth PeriodPrompt: Indicate a person who has a significant influence on you and describe that influence.\n\nEvery girl grows up being a daddy\u2019s little girl, they grow up seeing their dad as a super hero.

Mostly all kids have a good childhood and some not so many that good. People like seeing little kids laugh, smile, giggle, and play. I wished I had a childhood like that it would off change me. I would enjoy my years but I couldn\u2019t because I had responsibilities when I was a little kid.\nWhen I was a little kid I had to look out for my little brother. I had to help out my mom around the house and help here clean houses so we can get money and pay the bills and for food. Also on top of anything my dad left us or abandoned us when I was 8 years old. When I was 10 I had to work in a job so I can help out my mom,Prompt: A Personal or national issue that is important to you\nThe distribution of wealth in America is one of the biggest issues to me on a personal level and is a big problem on a national level too. Economic equality doesn\u2019t seem like a priority in this country with the lopsided balance of wealth in this country. Surveys have been done interviewing Americans of all different backgrounds and economic status and most thought that the distribution of wealth in America was a lot closer than in reality what it is. There are a lot of people in America struggling, out of work and not meeting their financial needs and that I see as a big problem because, the situation could be handled better to where everyone can benefit.\nNow I can\u2019t ever see Americas wealth being distributed equally because, there would be no drive to work and achieve goals and make more money. I do believe that the gap between how much the wealthy, the middle class and poor people make is way too wide. 40 % of this nation\u2019s wealth go to the top 1%. That means those big C.E.O\u2018s guys like bill gates 40% of the whole nations wealth goes to those guys. The average these guys get paid is 380x more than there average employee and in the fast food industries over 1200x more. Now I\u2019m sure that\u2019s these guys work very hard for their money but its very hard to believe that they are working 1200x or even 380x harder than their employees. Also the richest 20% of Americans own 84% of the nation wealth.\nThere are so many people on food stamps and other government assistance programs because, of this problems. You have people with degrees and can\u2019t find jobs that pay well enough to provide for their families and daily lifestyle. There are millions in this country who struggle to make ends meet financially and very few rich people, but yet the ratio of how much they make versus millions of Americans is ridiculous.\n\nThere is also a big reason why the rich make so much more money than the poor. Normally poor people are unaware of this situation and just trying to get by in life. The poor and middle class a lot of times do not educate themselves to this situation and it seems as the rich care more because, they want to keep all the money there making. If we want to make money and solve this problem we have to wake up and realize what\u2019s actually going on with our wages and demand a better distribution of the wealth in this country.Prompt: ?\n\nA good lawyer can the be the biggest factor in a case. A great example that many people have heard was is the o.j. Simpson case. Many people thought that he commit the crimes. Most of the proof connected to the crime he was accused did point to him, however Simpson brought the bet lawyers money could buy. With his lawyers he was found not guilty which surprised many people. I personally do not care if Simpson was or was not guilty however his case did teach me the importance of a good lawyer.\nWhen I was a boy my brother was arrested for murder, later they found the real killer but he spent two years on the inside. When I found out he was guilty I felt tears falling my face. My family could not afford a very good lawyer and we had to use a family friend, Joe Vincent. My mother said that Vincent was an okay lawyer but the prosecutor was like Peitho, the Greek god of persuasion. My mom would not let me attend the trail (she thought it would be inappropriate for a seven year old.) I had to grind my teeth or I would yell at the top of my lungs. When my brother was convicted many of my own family members believed he was guilty. That reinforced my belief that a lawyer has the power to win any case. That\u2019s why I want to be lawyer to make sure the right people are convicted.\n\nIf a lawyer is good enough he can be the main factor in a case. Even with all the evidence stacked, like the Simpson case, a lawyer can still win your case. A convince judge or jury that a man is guilty or innocent, that is why I want to be a lawyer. After the I read about the Simpson case I a light off went in my head, I saw that could help a lot people by just being their lawyer. I know now that there is a lot to being a lawyer but I still want to help people by being their lawyer.\n\nSomething else I found out about lawyer is that many people could not afford the good ones. I plan on doing a lot of pro bono work. I want to help everyone I believe to be innocent. Many people who cannot afford a good lawyer and are found guilty and have a harsher punishment, however people of considerable wealth usually get off quite easy because the can afford amazing lawyers. There are many examples of the rich getting off easy besides the Simpson case. Walmart is sued every for some another but they can afford the best lawyers alive. I believe many big companies can sell harmful food or underpay their employees not because they bribe government officials but because they get the best lawyers they can buy to convince the government that everything is fine.\n\nThose reasons I not only want to be a lawyer but I want to start my own firm, because many lawyers abuse their powers of persuasion for money. My firm will be about help people who can\u2019t afford a good lawyer and of course those who can because I need to make a living. I will try to be the best lawyer I can be so no one has to watch their innocent brother go to jail.Prompt: Greatest challenge I have faced\n\nHaving to grow up looking different than other can be difficult especially when your overweight .you get looked at differently , judged differently , and treated differently and this has been my greatest challenge faced so far .\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear of something that weighs 224 pounds? Big and heavy right? Well that was me, a big 14 year old girl with low self-esteem. Everywhere I went I was looked at differently than others. I didn\u2019t even want to leave my room because even my family looked at me differently with eyes looking straight at me up and down with disgust and disappointment knowing that I could do better , but I didn\u2019t care I ate and ate whatever I desired I don\u2019t even know what I ate most of the time because the more they looked at me like that the more I wanted to eat but then I realized I was getting bigger and unhealthy so I ate less and it was a nightmare but then I started noticing results but it still wasn\u2019t enough but I didn\u2019t give up on myself .\n\nAs time passed by I was being judged because I was still over weight. People called me fat, ugly and people made fun of me in every possible way they could. I was embarrassed of myself I was even made fun of for trying to lose weight and everything I ate I didn\u2019t know what to do that I would just cry to sleep but I kept telling myself hard work will pay off and people will see that they were wrong to bully some overweight girl because I will shine .\n\nAs I got older I started having more friends and they were all thinner than me and every time we went out together all the boy would have their eyes on them but me .I knew is was because of my weight cus no guy likes big girls well at least that\u2019s what thought and all I had on my mind is that why don\u2019t they look at me like that? , why don\u2019t they think im cute ? so I lost more weight .Prompt: Who has influence me the most\n\nI was between the ages of 12-14 when I realized that who has influents me by my parents and my sisters. My parents and sister are my influence because they have been there with me since day one; they also my parents and sisters always told me that what I should do and don\u2019t, Also all of them helps me with everything.\nMy parents and my sisters have been there for me since day one. If I ever need any advice my parents and sisters will always be there for me. Also everyone who influence me they will always have my back and tell will always give me good advice for any problems I have/gotPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nEvery time I think of my first day of sophomore year I can picture it in my head like if I am living in the moment. That night I had to go to bed, my eyes were opened as wide as three school buses put together because I could not sleep from how excited I was to go to school. I kept reaching under my pillow for a little white iPhone 4s -that barely functioned just to glance at the time. It was barely twelve or twelve \u2013twenty around that time. I was so anxious to meet new people eat lunch with friends and just the feeling of arriving as a sophomore made it tough for me to fall asleep. I had no Idea I was going to meet someone that will make a difference in me and the way of seeing things in life. You never know who will influence you for good or bad.\n\nIt was a brand new year at my high school. Everyone is excited well, almost everyone. As I walked in the building I saw Amanda, one of my classmates from last year. We never really talked it was a Hi and bye kind of thing but this time she was more excited to see me than ever. I could tell by the way she approached me and yelled my name out across the halls. I guess you could say she was lonely and didn\u2019t want to roam the school alone on the first day. I didn\u2019t mind at all because I was alone too. I pulled out a crumpled piece of paper that contained my schedule and I started to scan the routine I had to take. As I placed my schedule back she asked me what I had for first period. \u201cI have French first what about you?\u201d I responded. I recall the smile she carried on her face when she said, \u201cOMG I do too!\u201d We both pulled out our schedules to compare them and it turned out that not only did we have first period together but, we had each other in all classes.\n\nNever did it cross my mind that Amanda and I would have classes together.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nI Know like every college essay, people talk about their mom being their hero, but in my case I truly believe my mom is my hero. My mom has faced many challenges in her life and she always makes it work out to her benefit. I watched my mother struggle with 3 jobs, she worked in Columbia University in the human resources department, she worked as a mom, and she was my teacher. Even to this day no challenge stops her from reaching her goal, I am glad to say in 2016 like me she will be graduating but she will be getting her bachelors\u2019 degree.\n\nWhen I started the second grade things started to become hectic because I was always getting in trouble at home and my mom being a young mother didn\u2019t know I had a hereditary learning challenge where I have a difficult time hearing and pulling phonetic sounds. She thought I was being lazy and would make me stay up late on school nights to finish my homework. Years later we discovered that my brother came out with the same hereditary reading challenge, we also discovered that the gene was given to me and my brother through my dad who had gotten it from his mother.\n\nMy mother wasn\u2019t always the happiest or patience woman, my dad expected a lot from her and so did we. She was our mom, a co-worker, a wife, a teacher, and a chef. A lot of her responsibilities became mine when I entered 6th grade. I was responsible for leaving for school at 8:05, after school going straight to karate class, at 6 o\u2019clock leaving karate to go pick up my brother and sister from afterschool and taking them home so they can start on their homework and I had to help them with their homework too. When I entered the 7th grade I told my mom that it was a lot of pressure to go to school karate and pick up the kids on time to get them home, so she placed me in the same after school program so right after they release me I can get my brother and sister and take them home. Things soon became very complicated when the girls at my school wanted to fight me and would chase me home every day after school. So my mother had to lie and say we lived with my aunt so I can go to the same school as her kids. So my mother would drive me to school every day right before she left for work and I would have to take the bus home to get to my afterschool. When my mother got home at 6:30 she would say hi to us and go straight to the kitchen to cook dinner. MY dad expected dinner to be done when he got home because he worked 2 jobs. My mother did all the parenting because my dad was always tired and sleepy when he got home so she had to do a lot of the disciplining herself. Sometimes her choices weren\u2019t the best but she did the best she could.Prompt: Describe an important transition in your life\n\nImagine waking up one morning to the bitter sound of nothing. You\u2019re the last to wake up but that could\u2019ve fooled anyone with the amount of silence flowing throughout the entire house. I remember walking downstairs to the kitchen on June 3rd 2015, and seeing my family gathered around the dinner table. Without them even saying a word I already knew what was coming next. I mentally prepared myself for what I was about to hear but there\u2019s not enough ways in the world to prepare yourself to hear that your home isn\u2019t going to be your home anymore.\n\nAfter 15 years of living in the same house and learning this place like the back of my hand and watching as what was once the little tree outside our house grow every day, or watching the progression of the fresh black concrete fade as the days went by to a dry grey color, after all of that; this house wasn\u2019t going to be ours anymore. This was the same house I learned to ride a bike at, where I met my best friend the first day we moved here from Texas when I was only 3 years old, where I had my birthday parties, where I experienced the most important milestones in my life; letting go seemed more than impossible. Moving day came and I watched as each room in our house became empty; it was almost as if we were never there.\n\nIt was an emotional roller coaster. Although a part of me was hurt I had to push my feelings to the side and be a support system for my parents. I did not let them know how I was feeling about the whole situation and just tried my best to uplift their spirits. I didn\u2019t want them to feel in anyway guilty because I knew well that everything was done that could have possibly been done to try to keep our home. I was grateful to them because although we were in a tight situation money wise they pushed every penny they had and still managed to give our family a nice house to live in. it\u2019s a beautiful place really it\u2019s a town house, 2 story, wood floors with white rooms. The first time I walked into this house I felt like crying because I knew there was no going back to my old house. After nights of crying and missing my old home, I realized change should always be good. No matter how difficult the situation might be, or how \u201cimpossible\u201d letting go may seem to you at the moment you always have to make sure that you use your time wisely. That\u2019s exactly what I did. This situation might not seem like the most tragic thing in the world, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s not. This transition alone though ,has taught me to enjoy every second of what I have while I have it because you never know if the next day you\u2019ll wake up and it won\u2019t be there for you anymore.\n\nI learned to take advantage of my time because you can never go back. This is a lesson everyone should learn in their lifetime, I know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 thing to say but I never really found the true meaning of this until I experienced it firsthand. Time is everything and sometimes you don\u2019t get warnings as to when it will be gone. I\u2019ve lived by this everyday but never really embraced it like I do now. You need to enjoy everything till the last bit of it. Losing my house was an awful point in time for our family, but we learned quickly from this. This happening made us learn to value everything in our lives to a further extent. This was a lesson well learned and well needed.Sixth PeriodPrompt: The greatest challenge that I expect to face\n\nOk, so since I\u2019m talking about my greatest challenge I thought about it, but I realized I cannot think of one. So I decided to just write about the challenge that I am facing now in my senior year of high school. So really this is the greatest challenge I have ever faced. So come with me in this challenge and image what I\u2019m going through.\nSo one day my consoler had called me in to his office and had showed me what my credits were. So I saw it and I wondered and thought to myself. Am I really going to graduate with my senior class in May 2016? But first for me to do that, I need to go through some steps in order to graduate. And believe me it\u2019s a lot of steps. So the things I need to do are mandatory.\n\nSo what I need to do is? 1. Pass all the classes I have this semester and next semester. 2. I have to do credit recovery this semester and next semester. 3. Do 2 classes online or from a different place like faith academy, phoenix, and a different place that which I forgot. 4. Pass all of those in those classes and then I need 1.5 credits of the following: Arts, foreign language, or technology class outside of Berkmar. And this is a lot to do on my part, And not to mention a lot of money for all that. So this year I really got to step up my game a lot on my grades. If I want to pass and graduate next year may.\nThis right here had got put to the top of this list of challenges. But anyway let me continue on this. When I had got home and told my mom and dad what I needed to do. We started looking up what I can do and how much everything is going to be and everything. I can tell u right now it\u2019s not going to be cheap at all. When I was talking to my consoler, and he was telling me a lot of things I need to do. His face didn\u2019t look like a good one. He told me that it would be a lot of work for me and was telling me to just finish it next year in December. And he was saying that it won\u2019t be cheap because of where I had to take it. So I said ok and that I was going to go ahead and try it.\n\nThe reason y this is a big challenge for me is because of what my consoler said when I had left his office. He said and I quote that it was going to be hard and he told me that it\u2019s not impossible but he didn\u2019t say it was possible. So when he said that I said to myself this is a big challenge for me do I accept? And in my head I said yes I do challenge accepted. So now this will be the biggest challenge I have ever faced. Now let me see if I can compete this challenge or is it going to be a fail? Never know till I try.Prompt: You have been elected President of the United States; write your inauguration speech for us.\n\nGreetings, my fellow Americans of the United States of America. As your new President, I would like to share my feelings and changes I have in mind to put our country in a positive direction. But, before anything, I would like to thank the citizens of America for making me their new President and giving me a chance to better our country.\n\nFirst, I have a speech for you America, a speech to demonstrate my options, or plans for this country of ours. Let\u2019s all face it; America is heading upside down, Economy/National issues. Our war on isis has been going on for a bit now, and our previous president has done NOTHING to get us out of the situation, instead he used his 2 cents and made things worse. But , my goal on the other hand , is to bring our troops home and end the conflict with isis , simply by destroying them , talk is cheap , serious action needs to be done, quickly. Now , promises have failed this country so now I will say , America, I will give you my word , isis will no longer be an issue for the United States.\n\nSecondly, I would like to address the welfare problem; it has completely gotten out of hand. Most people on welfare get money every month, without even giving an attempt to get a job or make something of themselves. It\u2019s nice to know where my tax dollars are going, along with many other Americans. But now that I\u2019m in office that will change. The welfare policy will be if you sign up for welfare and you don\u2019t have a job currently, you have 4 months to find a job and be accepted or else if you don\u2019t complete the task, you wouldn\u2019t be qualified for welfare and have to wait 1 year before you can try again. You only get $100 for groceries, every month, which should be great because you will have a job if you\u2019re on welfare.\n\nLastly, I would like to address the complication of cops, and how some people have their opinion that police officers are to overpowered and they are serving brutality to African Americans. Police officers do their job; they risk their lives to save others.

So with that being said I will change the law to where, if you fail to cooperate and listen to the cop by the first instruction, you simply need to be taken in , because you failed to listen and follow direction , and it would be a fine for Failure to follow instructions.\n\nIn conclusion, America I\u2019m here to create a brighter future for everything and everyone. But most importantly make a brighter future for our country, The United States of America. With that being said , expect bigger and better things , thank you for electing me as your President.Prompt: ?\n\nChallenges can be helpful or they can be stressful. Either a good stress that motivates you to do your very best or the bad kind that can lead to health problems and bring you down. Either way it goes, challenges help us, regardless if we like what the challenges is. My greatest challenge is happening right now, deciding what college to go to.\n\nThere are many different colleges that I can apply to. Most of the schools, I don\u2019t even know the name or where they are located. I want to be a high school art teacher. Meaning I most have 4 years of with a major in education and art as my minor. I originally thought that it that art would be my major and education would be my minor. I was born in Missouri, so it would be good to find colleges there, because I already know the area. Atlanta is my second choose, it is where I am currently living and where I most likely be living for another year.\n\nThere are two school that interested me Slayer University and Kaplan U. Slayer has class that I would have to go to, but Kaplan u has online classes which is way more convenient for me saying that I am no actually in Missouri at the moment. Although, I might miss out on the experience of campus life, online classes seem a lot less of a hassle. Now that I have chosen the schools that I am most interested in I have to make a plan of action. I must first look at the requirements and see if I meet them. Then I must make sure I have a place to stay for which ever school I end up going to whether with family, a dorm with a roommate, or even an apartment. Either way it goes I will need to get a job that will allow me to study and attend classes.\n\nAnother challenge that would go along with this is that Georgia and Missouri are very different places. In Georgia I feel like a car is a most have thing most of the stores and restaurants are miles away. When I lived in Missouri, I and my friends walked to almost every store and restaurants, the stores were never further then 1-2 miles away from where I lived it was great and we never wasted gas. In Missouri it\u2019s in the north meaning it snows. I used to roll in the snow as a child and December was that happiest month for me because I love when the temperature is below 20 degrees. In Georgia I hate it, here it never snows and the temperature doesn\u2019t even go below 40 degrees. It\u2019s too hot here; if I do end up going to a college in Georgia it will have been my last possible option.\n\nMy greatest challenge was deciding what college to go to. Now that I have looked at the pros and the cons, moving to Missouri or staying here in Georgia I decided that Missouri is where I belong. Having already lived there for most of my life and having family close by it would also be the smart choose. Yes Georgia has its pros, but the cons over way them. This challenge has affected my life in a good way. I the way that it made me think about what I want to do with my life after high school it gave me another challenge. That is to get in the college that I want to go to.Prompt: The Person Who Inspired Me The Most\n\nThe women who took care of me for 17 years always told me, \u201cDo something that you love and not something for the love of money.\u201d My mom has been and always will be my number one supporter. She was the person who encouraged me to be comfortable in expressing myself. She was the one who wanted me to strive to be someone that I would be happy about 5 years down the road. My mom is the reason I\u2019m going for this. I always knew cosmetology was something I loved and wanted to do for a very long time.\n\nI can remember the first time I started wearing makeup. I woke up one morning feeling bold and snuck in one of my mom\u2019s mascaras out her purse that felt like a never-ending cave. Being only in 5th grade, I had no idea what I was doing. I\u2019ve seen my mom put on her bright lipstick and her neutral eye shadow colors with peachy cheeks before and it just excited me about wanting to be exactly like her. I was terrified that my mom would catch me, but I honestly couldn\u2019t wait to ask her. I only finished putting mascara on one eye and left to school like that.\n\nThroughout the years, I went through some pretty bad embarrassments. My first year of middle school I decided I needed a new me, a new haircut. I chopped off my hair. My nest of hair looked like I closed my eyes and sneezed when I cut it. My seventh year wasn\u2019t any better. I used to watch a lot of videos on the internet. So I decided to experiment on picture day. I see these girls on TV that made any eye color look just absolutely stunning. I wanted to do what they did. I remember wearing this flamingo bright pink on my eyes with some lipstick that looked like a basket of red apples. I don\u2019t know how I survived school. All those years and my mom always told me that practice makes perfect.\n\nAs I grew older and my mind-set changed, wanting to be a cosmetologist never did. While everyone wanted to be a doctor, computer expert, or even a zoo keeper, I wanted to dedicate my life on making other people feel good about themselves. I\u2019ve been told that a cosmetologist isn\u2019t a job a hundred times that at some point I started to believe them. My mom is the one who said, \u201cIf it makes money, it\u2019s a job.\u201d My passion for hair and beauty is unbelievable. I made sure I got ahead on my high school credits to attend Maxwell and start early. My goal one day after high school and later finishing up cosmetology school is to open up a business over in Texas. I know I\u2019m setting the bar high on this one but I\u2019m going to for it and I\u2019m sticking to this. My mom encouraged me to do this and make it happen at whatever risk. She\u2019s all the support I need to make this happen.\n\nMy mom wants me to aim high but walk through stairs. Applying to Paul Mitchell School is the first step on my staircase. Being accepted to this school would be an honor and privilege to attend to. This school is everything I want. Paul Mitchell is every future cosmetologist dream. The challenges I would have to face are going to be worth every sweat and tear being a student here. This is where I set foot outside of my box. Through this school, I will be become the person I\u2019ve long waited to be and I know my mom would be so proud to call me her daughter.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nRole models, we all them or at least someone we look up too weather that person is real or fictional. Personally speaking I have several role models but the main one that I can say has had the biggest influence on me is batman. \u201cYes batman\u201d the dark night himself. Going back I remember watching the old series batman and just thinking he was (in simplest terms) awesome! Since then he was already a part of my life but it wasn\u2019t until the beginnings of middle school when he really impacted me. To begin with, I wasn\u2019t a very social person most throughout my life. More or less due to the fact that I had terrible self-esteem because of previous encounters with bulling in elementary school. To worsen things I was already a naturally shy person and my face would always turn tomato red and my palms would start to get moist every time I would get called on to answer a question or even do something simple like walking to talk to the teacher. As years passed by things got worse and they weren\u2019t looking any better as time passed. Thus watching my entire favorite hero\u2019s on TV and such I really got into the character batman. This is because of the entire hero\u2019s that would pass on TV, they all were likable friendly extrovert kinds of people and batman was the complete opposite. He was quite, serious; he wouldn\u2019t play and had no friends, in addition to the fact that even some civilians (the people he protects) fear him. All that though didn\u2019t bother batman. He would still carry his duty and protect the people regardless of anything. So eventually what started to happen was that I found myself relating to batman\u2019s person or character. In doing so, it made things start looking up for me. How? Because I could now be myself and not feel completely down about the way I was. If batman could be serious and scary to people but yet a hero at the same time, why not I.\u201d maybe not a hero\u201d but at least out there handling my business without caring what people think. Anyways as the years started to pass I would just feel better and better about myself. It got to the point that it would show through my character, personality, voice; just everything that I was indeed feeling more comfortable with myself. So By the time of high school I was a different person. I was more out spoken, people would approach me and not say that were scared of me or such. Everything was going great but then things took a slight turn. Those kids that I had problems with bulling in elementary school were going to BHS as well. Everything was still all well until I would see them or they would have the same class as me. I would just feel a huge explosion go off in my chest and my head got really hot and my mood would just change for the worst in a second. The reason for that was that I couldn\u2019t forgive them for what they had done to me previously. This experience or event however let me to be able to relate to batman a little more in the sense of forgiveness. To begin with, watching batman I noticed that no matter what any villain did or how corrupt and psycho that person was, he never once hurt an enemy to the point that they were in the hospital or anything. Instead he would warn them before he did anything and if they didn\u2019t listen then he would take action. From all that though, what I took in was that he forgave the bad for himself to be the better person and not give into a bad path where he would end up being the same or no better than the people he fights against. Thus I admired that and decided to forgive all my enemies and such and just be the bigger person and carry on with my life. In doing so I was able to finish high school and carry on with the world and with ease all thanks to my number one hero/idol batman.Literally I feel like my heart just dropped to the floor and I am terrified to pick it back up. My eyes were locked at the end of the board all I had to do now was to take my steps and do my dive. Every step I took I felt like the board was getting longer and longer and I wouldn\u2019t be able to reach it but at last I was at the end and you better believe I was riding that board like it was my life on the line. Shooting me off like a cannon ball I majestically did my dive and I went into the water like a fish causing no splash at all.\n\nBeing in the water felt really peaceful like if it was another world I could hear people clapping and chanting like animals fighting over a piece of meat as I arose to the surface I could hear the scoring from the judges overall they thought it was a good dive. Coming out of the water knowing that I was done competing felt great my heart was no longer on that board it was right back in my rib cage. Considering that it was my first meet I thought I did pretty good looking at my team from a far I could see them jumping up and down and cheering. Getting closer and closer to them made my smile stretch all the way up to the ends of my ears I was extremely happy because knowing that I made them proud gave me great joy in seeing them. Arriving to the bench where my team was stationed at felt like I was arriving to home from a long trip.\nMinutes after I had taken a seat to rest and to think about overall on how did I began to realize that I had come so far to be at this level. A short woman with big ol\u2019 white hair had started to rally up a commotion about me to my coaches. Suddenly I felt a pounding on my shoulder coming from someone wanting my attention I slowly turned around to acknowledge the person and it turned out to be the women with big ol\u2019 hair. Looking at me with her big eyes I knew she had some news to tell me and it was good news.Prompt: ?\n\nThe past mistakes make you rethink your choices and decisions to better yourself. \u201cLife does not get better by chance, it gets better by change.\u201d My life has been impacted in many ways as I grew up starting when I was 5 years old and barely came to the United States in the year of 2004. I thought my life would be such a hurricane due to what had happened in my family especially with my own mother and led to changing the way of living with my brother. Family is very important in our daily life. Family supports you on anything, loves you regardless how much someone can fail them and family are people that are always there for you helping you with important things such as your education or deciding what type of pathway you will choose when going into college. People in the world do not realize how much impact they can cause into someone\u2019s life either for better or for bad such as falling into depression or finding better ways to make them even better as a person.\n\nFairy tales don\u2019t exist maybe in movies and shows but not in real life where many broken pieces with unanswered questions will be found, unfortunately some stories don\u2019t end with a \u201chappily ever after\u201d. A couple of months had passed by since I arrived from Mexico to Georgia. A lot of changes were going on in my family, one started with my mother who was being strange all the time, who at times made her own kids feel like the only mother they had was their grandmother and aunts. A few days passed away, my brother and I were playing outside until we saw our mother walking by with a bag that was full of her and my little sister\u2019s clothes. She had told us that she was going to sale those clothes or donate them but who could of thought what she said was all a lie. Days and a couple of months went by no type of communication was involved after my mom left with my little sister, until it was my little cousins birthday party was when I finally got to see my little sister and this time would be for forever. Someone I did not see was my mom.\n\nYears have come by and there was no communication done with her. Almost 15 years have come by with no word being heard from the person that gave me birth, I forgot who my mother is, how she looks like and her way of being. All I remember was that I had a mother who just didn\u2019t care about hurting her own kids or leaving them without thinking about how much they will end up needing her throughout the years. During those 15 years of life for 3 years I fell into depression where all I wanted to do was commit suicide simply because seeing my friends with both their parents made me jealous and feel worthless. I always dreamed of having perfect parents who would last forever and be an example for their own kids. Fairy tales don\u2019t end with happy ending sometimes you have to create your own beginning by having people that will help you and never give up on you and end up with a happy ending.\nThe years continued to go on until I was 10 years old. My brother was going into his last year of high school unfortunately my family was breaking apart economically. My father had it very tough with my siblings, grandma and I. He had two jobs in which he got paid well but that money wasn\u2019t enough for the bills that needed to be paid.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n\nDid you ever had that feeling when you\u2019re hopeless? Or that moment when you just want to give up? Or that feeling when you\u2019re stuck and don\u2019t know how to get out of the situation? I had, a ton and I feel like I\u2019m the only one with problems. That\u2019s when I need help but like friends aren\u2019t always there. My sister Elsy has helped me time to time and gave me advice even though I don\u2019t do what she tells me what I should do in my own problems.\n\nMy sister Elsy, loves to create pictures on paper. She also influence me on \u201cNot giving up\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s more than one way.\u201d Whenever I need advice, she\u2019s the one that can give a hand. She even has her bad situations of her own, when she draws. Elsy makes an image on a paper, yet it doesn\u2019t seem right to her, so she keeps on trying till she gets it right. Then there\u2019s me, I doutle something and it comes out awful, so I do what Elsy did. I keep on tryin\u2019 till I get it right.\n\nElsy also helps me when there\u2019s a boy problem, in relationship, sometimes I need help on what to do. The feeling when I was being a toy and my feelings didn\u2019t have meaning. There\u2019s problems everyday and it never quits. Elsy tells me to drop it and go to the next one or better to stay single. She was right and I realized I needed to think of myself first and for what is best for me. I give people advice, yet I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t take my own advice.\n\nElsy also influence me on planning for my future after graduation. My sister has a big future ahead of her and she knows where her place is at. It made me think,What am i going to do after graduation? Which college am i going to go? Where am I going to be in the future? Of course Elsy lend a helping hand and step by step my plans grew. I would go to college and learn fashion arts or music. After college I head off to country to country and with my career, I express it. Soon I would settle in a very wealthy house with new members.\n\nEven though Elsy is younger than me she is a big influence for me. Her life was like a shadow being behind me between middle school and high school, that is how she understands what I\u2019m going through. She knows what is best for me \u201cI\u2019m telling you this Sandy because I don\u2019t want you to end up in the garbage out in the world.\u201d We act like cats and dogs time to time and I hate it when Elsy acts like a parent. But Elsy had helped me through rocky times. I love the fact that she\u2019s my sister and I can always count on her when I need a hand.Prompt: ?\n\nDonald Trump wants to beat everyone in poles but where does he really stand in the economy?

It would be great if I achieve my achievement that I always have been achieving for. And it is to start a business of my own to have a better career in the future but in order for that I need to have education also a lot of money to build the business that I am trying to build because it will need a lot of equipment that is necessary for the business. So I going to try to build up as fast I could to make some money for me and to have my own house also I would like to graduate from high school because I\u2019m trying to be the first member of my entire family to graduate from high school. It has so much meaning to me because ever since I saw my brother dropout I was thought that I going to the first to get a high school diploma to have a better job than my brothers, I would like to buy a new house for my family.

What do this quote means to me is that life is a challenge. In which it is, but that don\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get passed that challenge. My biggest challenge is my IEP. What does IEP means to me; well I should say what it did mean to me. IEP means to me is a small problem in life that I have struggled with for a long time. The real meaning is \u201c(IEP) \u2014 to help kids succeed in school\u201d. I have an IEP in reading, math and writing.\n\nI would say reading is my biggest one, it not that I can read it just means I struggle with that the most. I have the biggest fear that one day I would just get called out in front a whole bunch of people and be told to read something. People are my biggest fear when you say something or something they would laugh. When I am by myself when I read for miles, it seems I forget all the worlds when I\u2019m around people. I have been getting better though, I read more and also out loud.\n\nMath is the easy for me; I can do it with flying colors if I know what I\u2019m doing. For math all I have to do is listen to the teacher and ask questions. Really math isIndicate a person who has had a significant influence on you can describe that influence.\n\nRole models are people you look up to and admire. They can be celebrities, family members, or a friend. They can also influence you through many ways like maybe through a song or a picture .Their influence can either be positive or negative. My mother has influenced me to be hardworking, supportive, and positive.\nMy mother has influenced me to be hardworking, because she started working at a young age, she has her own business, and she started from the bottom. My mother started working at the age of 13 in Mexico, and she was taken out of school. She practically was the only person bringing home the money, because her parents didn\u2019t work enough to support the family. This made me realize that working hard in school pays off, because not everyone has the same opportunities in other countries. My mother owning her own business influences me to strive to own my own business someday and be the best I can be. She is her own boss and doesn\u2019t have to worry about someone else constantly being over her. Also she started from the lowest point to building her way to the top. This shows me that it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from or who you are you have the potential to be a somebody and not be nobody.\n\nMy mother has influenced me to be positive, because you are able to see a different outlook on life and many doors open for you. My mom has gotten to where she is today by staying positive, no matter how bad a certain situation got or if she was going through a tough time; She always looked on the bright side. She would always overcome that certain obstacle. This taught me that no matter what obstacle I face, I will overcome it. Also staying positive can lead to opening new doors for me, because mom has had many doors open for her. She started working for the first time when I was 8, and she would get mean comments from her coworkers .She didn\u2019t allow that to affect her instead she stayed positive, and she soon started to get more and more opportunities. She was able to buy the store she was once an employee at, all because she was positive and kept her cool throughout the time she was working there. This has made have a different point of view on things and not to hold grudges towards other people.\n\nMy mother has influenced me to be very supportive of myself and others, because being supportive towards other people can really show others what\u2019s important to you, and what you care about. My mom has been very supportive about my plans and goals for the future. She has sat down with me and asked me about my future plans, and she listens to what I have to say. She also gives me advice on how I shouldn\u2019t be to insecure on what other people say about me and always do my best at whatever it is. This has really taught me that I am really fortunate to have a mom who supports me, because not everyone is fortunate to have parents who support you on your plans after high school.\n\nIn all, my mom has been the person I admire the most; she has influenced me in many ways the words can\u2019t explain. She has taught me that it is important to be hardworking, because hard work pays off. Also that having a positive mind set can lead to new opportunities. Also that having support in your life can help you .Prompt: Discuss what makes you uniquely qualified for this position.\n\nThe reason why I should work at Footlocker or any other shoe company, because I have the potential for working with shoes, and Im also an excellent shoes salesman. I really want this job, because I can finally help support my mom pay some bills and help my family with the rent, and also make her proud. To be honest I really think that working at footlocker is going to be an easy task to do because once a customer walks in the store imam greet them with respect and let them find some shoes that they are looking for, and if I see them struggle then imam walk up to them and ask them if they need any help or any shoes that they are looking at in particular.\nThere are going to be some strengths and weakness that I\u2019m going to have when I work there, and my strengths are greeting the customers with a smile, asking them if they need any help, going to the back room and going to get their shoe size and then going to the register and ringing them up correctly. My weakness are knowing the type of shoes that they want that will be comfortable for them and also seeing which shoe will be in style for kids and adults, but I can manage to get to that by researching online and looking them up to get real comfortable with hooking them up with shoes. I feel like that I can be way better than the other workers that I\u2019m going to be working with because once a customer comes in and ask one of my co-worker that they are looking for some shoes that they can play basketball in and then they\u2019re going to be like I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, then that is when I come in and be like I know the perfect shoes that can be fit for you when you play basketball, then I walk over to that section and show them and then they are going to say hey I like these, then I ring them up and tell them to have a nice day and come back and see us again. Another reason is that I\u2019m very organized and very nice when it comes to talking to people and I\u2019m also very friendly, for example if you come up to me and ask me a question I am going to say sure I can help you with something and then walk over there and see what the customer needs help with and then once they ask me that they need a shoe measure, I\u2019m going to go and get the thing to measure their foot to see what size I need to get.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\nIs there a person who significant influence on you. Like your parent, your friend, and your cousin. What makes you unique person you are today. The person takes you places you like to go. Who makes you happy when you are in a bad day?\nThere is a person I significant influence. That is my dad. He do is best for us, have insurance, makes go to school and buy us food. My dad tells me what is right and wrong. Each day if we do something wrong he would repeat the things over and over again in a good way.\n\nWe love him anyway he does. He takes the places you like to go. I wanted to go to the mall or the book store. My dad was doing something he was watching a soccer games, he said to wait for the break time. He will drive you there. I have a sister we always fright, so my dad would say when you get order you won\u2019t have each other backs and regret what you have back then.\n\nMy dad would always tell us a story when he was small. Each time we talk during dinner time he would about his stories. He would say your parent can\u2019t stay with you; you have to do it on your own. When we have some kind of party, he doesn\u2019t like other people talk about his family like that. There are some people doesn\u2019t like us. Most of the party we go there are my mom she has a lot of friends. He always asks us about our day. He always asks us about our day. When we get home from school he would say that to us. My dad wants me a good life, not like my parent right now. My dad work at a Mayer Electric Suppler, my mom work at a nail place each day is like that. My dad doesn\u2019t want us like them. He would want us always to go to school.Seventh PeriodPrompt: Think of a place you know well. Describe the place, and include your feelings about it.\n\nHome; there\u2019s no place like it. It\u2019s my favorite place to be but also the place I loathe the most. The 13 years that I have lived in my house there have been so many memories made with my family and friends. Memories full of nonsense and memories full of love and fun.\nAll the foolishness and nonsense began when I moved from an apartment, into the house I live in now. I was only 4 when Daniel moved in the big blue house next to mine. Daniel is significant due to all the memories we made together and because he\u2019s my best friend. Daniel was the more creative, fun, and mischievous one between us. For example, one day when he and I were together and we were bored he thought of this game called \u201cadventures\u201d and I would always look forward to playing with him. Daniel to me was like a role model and if it weren\u2019t for him I wouldn\u2019t be me today. Although Daniel moved away not too long ago he and I are still best friends and if it weren\u2019t for him I wouldn\u2019t be the person I am today.\n\nGrowing up as a kid I would say I was different from the average American kid. And not only was I different so was my home/ lifestyle. I found out from experience that there\u2019s no place like my home. My family is from Bosnia and in Bosnia we do things different than here. Even though I was born here in Georgia, I\u2019m still very Bosnian due to my family. For example, in our culture we don\u2019t wear shoes in the house; I learned to take off my shoes whenever I enter a house. I was different and unique because my parents weren\u2019t really accustomed to the American life and they wanted me to retain all of our Bosnian culture but America changes you. America changes you because surviving in America is different than Bosnia. In Bosnia it would be easier to find a job, make money, and live a regular life but I had to forget about simplicity and an easy life and get accustomed to our economy. Although life may be harder here in America when I\u2019m home everything is easy that\u2019s why I love being home.\nNow that I\u2019m all grown and finishing high school soon I see my home and family in a different way. I understand everything my parents were trying to retain and teach me but still accept that I had to change to survive in America. Just like my mom had to learn English so she could get a job and provide for me and my family I had to do the same to provide for me and now also for my mom and dad. I also realized home isn\u2019t home without your family and your family doesn\u2019t only consist of blood relatives. An actual family for me consists of my blood relatives and my friends Daniel, Elvis, and Donny. If it weren\u2019t for every one of them home would never be the same. They all created me and created my home to be the way it is today.\n\nSo when you think about it there\u2019s really no place like home, and that doesn\u2019t just include me it includes the whole world. I\u2019m, sure everyone feels the same. If it weren\u2019t for me moving into this house, for me meeting Daniel, for me changing to get accustomed to the American way of life I wouldn\u2019t be here today and I wouldn\u2019t be the [...] I am today.Prompt: ?\nMany states are known by their stereotypes and other people around the world actually believe those stereotypes. New Jersey is one of those places that people believe only loud mouth and reckless citizens reside there. However, that is only what is shown on television just for the amusement of society. This voluptuous state is full of way more than just their stereotypes, we represent equality and togetherness. Being born and raised there, has taught me how to be a mature young lady. It has also taught me that your family can be spanned out across an entire state, and they will always be there for you. New Jersey is a place that I know well and that will stay in my heart no matter where I travel to.\nI lived in a small town that resided in Bergen County called Hackensack. It shared a small area with two other towns; Englewood and Teaneck. These towns were so small that you could walk over the bridge and you would be in Teaneck. Everything was so close to each other and it was very convenient in any type of emergency situations. Walking down the streets of Hackensack, you could just smell the aroma of flowers sprouting from the ground and smoke from the buses. You could hear people greeting you every five seconds that you walked down the street with a warm \u2018Hello\u201d. People always had bright smiles on their faces like they had all won the lottery, even when it was like a blizzard during December. I lived near a diner called Fairmount Diner, Target and B&W Bakery, which were right across from the train tracks. You could smell pancakes dripping in syrup from the diner and freshly baked pastries containing sugar and flour from a mile away.\n\nHackensack became a gigantic influence on the way that I live my life. It has molded me into the model young woman that I have grown to be. Even after moving to Georgia, Hackensack is still in my heart no matter what and always will be. It was just one of those places that allowed me to be as creative as Leonardo da Vinci and I have learned to express that in my current location too. Whether it be through writing or drawing, I am a creative person. New Jersey taught me about family, equality and individualism in many ways that I could never possibly forget. That is the one place that means a lot to me and I am planning on going back really soon. I will be going back to see old friends and reconnect with all my family. Hackensack, New Jersey is a place that I know well and is also a place that will stay in my heart forever.Prompt: ?\n\nMany things in life help you become a better person and make you see how you should be. In my life there was one thing that really made be treat people differently and really began to love life. This was something that hit me like a fast ball and it was something that changed me forever.\nHeart beating fast, eyes bulged, Nothing was more important than this moment. I gave all my focus in to my cousin as she picked which hand the freshly covered in copper penny was in. My expressions and body turned firey inside and out as she somehow managed to pick the right hand again. Me becoming envious decided to change it up and do anything so that my cousin wouldn\u2019t win. The first thing that came to my head was that I should hide the penny in my cloths but I only had on my non pocketed jean dress and I had no pockets to hide them there so that was out of the question. The last and most secure place to me to hide the penny was in my warm moist mouth. At the time this seemed like a very intelligent Idea. Until my cousin chose a empty hand and I opened up my mouth and me still being the jealous person that I am decided I never wanted her to even see the penny again so I had made a decision that wasn\u2019t well thought out.\n\nI swallowed it! When it happened I could taste the copper slowly go half way down my throat. It happened so fast that I didn\u2019t realize that I had done something complet  ley wrongPrompt: ?\n\nChorus Room\n\nWho am I? I always repeat that question to myself. I realize that I\u2019m a different person then I was three years ago. When I view myself in the mirror I don\u2019t see all the agonizing misery that once took a place in me. I recognize a different person, someone who is overjoyed and at peace within their self. I only found this new conception because of a chorus room.\n\nHigh School pointed out all my flaws the moment I walked down the street at 6:25 a.m. to get to the bus stop on time. I arrived at this huge contraption at 6:45 a.m. As I walked in feeling apprehensive and insecure seeing all the different types of people. I found myself trying to find a familiar face to socialize with, but instead I ended going to my first class of a new environment.\nIn first period looking at 4 white walls and too timid to try and make conversation to new people\u2026 in comes some old friends and I was so excited to see them and start to make conversation. And soon it was time for Chorus. Chorus ended up being my safe place. A place where I could be myself and no one could judge me. I met all kind of different people in, and two of them became my best friends. They brought me out my shell and opened this new person that is present here today.\n\nThe Berkmar High School Chorus Room changed my life completely. I never was in a place where I felt so welcomed and felt like I belong. I always had to hide who I was because the fear of being rejected by society. But I wasn\u2019t rejected, I was accepted for all my flaws something that High School didn\u2019t do. High School pointed out all flaws but The Chorus Room made me embrace my flaws. It was the best thing that could ever happen to me.\nI grew and grew into a person you wouldn\u2019t even recognize three years ago, by my looks, maybe a little. Yes, not by the way I walked or talked or even the way I ate. But by how jubilant I was how nothing bothered me even loosing friends.Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face.\n\nPeople face a lot of different challenges throughout their lives. Some are able it to make it through and others just quit and fall off. Well I am not a quitter. I have faced challenges before and if I have to go through that situation again; I am sure that I will succeed.Prompt: ?\n\nThe person that has the most influence on me in life is superman, or you can say one of the strongest people I know\u2026\u2026my dad. He\u2019s like my backbone that keeps me straight. There\u2019s so many different thing I have learned from him and YouTube. I look up to my dad, because he goes out to work every day to provide and help my mom, sister, and me. I can tell working year round is not easy, but you got to do what you got to do. He\u2019s taught me how to not waist money depending on other people to do the same thing I can do. There\u2019s no telling where I\u2019d be without him.\n\nHe raised me to not be dependent on others, and different ways to make money the clean way. He introduced me to many different things that I know for a fact I wouldn\u2019t be doing without him today. We hang out more as best friends more than farther than son. Year round we are working and riding our horse. During fall and winter we hunt, and in the summer time only I fish. Mainly because he\u2019s not too good at it like I am. He\u2019s the one that taught me most of the laws of life that I know. The top two of them is \u201cEvery day is a new day\u201d, and \u201cLearn from yesterday, live for today, and hope for tomorrow\u201d. Sometimes I think about what if I wake up one morning and he\u2019s not there anymore.Prompt: ?\nIts 12:34 a.m. and I wake up frightened that I hear the phones from my job ringing. Ever since that moment forward I realized that needed to go to college that I wouldn\u2019t be able to work at a fast food like Pizza Hut. In life, there are challenges you have to change to be a better person in your future. In this moment, I realized didn\u2019t want to work at a place where I would be bossed around in a way that I felt uncomfortable. I have faced many different situations to the point where I feel that I can\u2019t be having someone treat me this way. Thanks to this job I\u2019ve realized that I need to work hard to get easy money. In other words, I need to go to college and face another hard challenge to get to where I can make easy money and not have to deal with people treating me however they want.\n\nAs a young teenager you want to make your own money to get your own things. In high school you face many situations and challenges in which you realize you need to be more dependent on yourself then your parents. Now as a senior I have realized its worth coming this long way and doing all I had to do to get where I am today. I am thankful for everyone that has helped me along the way and has pushed me to keep going. When I first started working my family supported me telling me if I didn\u2019t like the job because if I did it would mean I liked easy money in a way that isn\u2019t fair. In other words, it would not be right that I would work so hard to get so little money.There are many places in the world that can change a person. It could be a church or a certain place that you visited. It all can affect you from the way that they act, to the Future decisions you make. One place in significance many can relate to is prison. One place that I may Say has changed me is the football field. This place in many ways has changed me to become a better Individual.\nTo begin with, being on the football field alone conjures up memories good and bad. One way that it has changed me to be a better individual, is to always work hard. A moto that has always been self-evident every time I suit up, and walk on to the football field. For instance, one memory that comes to mind is the very first time I step foot on the field. I could remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Tuesday evening and hot as devils toes. The sweat trickled down into my eyes where it began to burn with no chance of it stopping at all. Then the coach called for individuals. I could not have taken another second of this. My knees began to tremble under the weight of my fatigue, but then one of the head coaches pulled me aside and told me calmly, \u201c you got this son, just keep going and never, the pain of today will be your gain tomorrow, I believe that you will go far.\u201d Ever since then have always worked hard.\nIn additionPrompt: ?\nIt was a warm sunny fall Sunday afternoon. It was a tough very stressful decision to make. Choosing a University to attend next fall. This experience has shown me that it\u2019s tough to make a decision without your parent\u2019s having a say. In what could affect you as you transition into your next phase in life.\nReceiving letters from different colleges is very exciting. Just to know that they are mailing and calling you just so you can come to their college is very fun. Seeing your mom\u2019s face turn bloodshot red, because she is tiered of all the college drama. Colleges will go to war with each other so they can lure you in to come on their campus.Prompt: Discuss what make you uniquely qualified for this position.\n\nContinuing my boxing career is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Because as a kid I loved things that were physically involved .However it may seems very easy sport. But it\u2019s really not. Meanwhile looking at the TV while two fighters are taking the hits may seem a little cool. But the fact that it can damage their brain in a long term. However it\u2019s hard to believe .Let us not forget that boxing is still one of the best sports that was invented during ancient Greece and Rome.\n\nSince I was 8 year old I loved boxing. I use to watch it a lot. I basically like sports that physically involve punching. Meanwhile I am new to United States of America .on the other hand, there was an Afghani family that that just moved to USA. My family knew them well. However one day I was watching a boxing match and he saw me .He asked me if I want to join a boxing club? Well he was a great boxer in Colombia .he had won a lot of trophy and medals and etc.Bascially the next day he takes me to the gym and my training begins. However know that he knew I loved boxing and how I take it serious. He decided that he will train me very seriously and he won\u2019t take it easy on me. However, for some reason I love his idea about training me very seriously .Because there are two different types of athletics in this world. One that takes it serious just like it\u2019s his or her passion. On the second hand there people who does for the time killer or the money. Well to me doing a sport for money is stupid idea. However there\u2019s people in world that does it for the money or to kill time. But however to me boxing as always been my sport, and my passion.\n\nIt was early in morning. The sky was still dark. While we were in car, going to Gym.my coach said today is a big day for you.when we arrive in the gym .I Saw couple of parents there and couple of students. It was a big day for me.It was my first boxing match. The first round went very well .But however during round nine, my hands were giving up.it was hard for me to see.Becuase I was stuck in a corner. However every time I would try to clinch on him. He would throw a jab and hook. Which was hard for me stay on balance. He would try to unbalance me but it wouldn\u2019t work. Now that round nine was over my coach told me this is the round that I have to go full power. Because we can\u2019t take the risk of going all twelve rounds. So the round started and I was dizzy I was acting like I was okay. But I got caught with a hook and he put into his corner. And he landed a lot of punches .But meanwhile I was waiting for him to do a single mistake and KO him. He seemed very tired. We still had a minute left on the clock. Well he drop his hands and my reaction was fast I duck down and jabbed him twice and I throw a right hook which made him off balance .From that point it was my turn so I throw many punches and my last punch KO him. And I won the match. Everybody thinks that boxing is an easy sport. It\u2019s not it take time to build speed and power punches. From that point on I learn my lesson no to wait for opponent to attack first. I should always start off.\n\nTo conclude, boxing has always been part of my life. To me boxing is like having a best friend beside you. \u201cAccording to some, boxing is just a sport, but according to me is not just sport, it\u2019s my passion, my life.\u201d\n\nI have faced plenty of challenges but the most important one that I expect to face is going to college. However, I just think of myself everyday of where I will be in the future. College is one of the most important things in someone\u2019s life because without college you\u2019re going to stay getting paid $7.25 an hour. College is a must have I see people every day struggling because they didn\u2019t went to college. I think that everyone should go to college if they want to be successful.\n\nPeople that go to college great treated different then everyone else because people know that they are going to be successful people in life. The other people that don\u2019t go to college get treated like crap. For example, I know my cousin that work at a mall and they were clowning him because he didn\u2019t have a high school diploma. You don\u2019t want to be like my cousin because even if someone asks you if you graduated you will feel embarrassed to say no. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to go to school and do what you have to do to get that education.Prompt: ?\n\nAbout 300,000 kids in America that plays high school football .Only 2,000 of those kids receive division 1 scholarship to college.100 of those 2,000 kids that make it to college go to the next level and that\u2019s the NFL and most of them won\u2019t make the team. Well I\u2019m one of those 300,000 kids that is fighting against the odds to be able to earn a college scholarship. It\u2019s a tough challenge that I have to face it\u2019s my senior year, and I have no, stars, no ranks, and only one way out.\n\nYear after year hearing the sound of a buzzer going off and hearing cheering and joy, but not from the people beside you nor behind you, but across the field of grass another team has defeated you again. The years of having losing seasons. This is the year that it\u2019s not going to happen again and I can\u2019t let that happen either. Definitely to the underclassmen who are the future of our program.Prompt: ?\n\nThe definition of challenges is to arouse of one\u2019s action or effort to stimulate the quality or requiring full use of one\u2019s ability, and energy. One of the greatest challenges that I am facing right now is high school. Why is high school my biggest challenge you might ask. Well it\u2019s simple deciding what to do with your life after high school, what career, and what field. All can take a lot and put stress on you.\n\nMy challenge is to finish high school and decide what to do with my life. For some of you who do not know. High school is not what you expect it to be like. Walking the hallways felt like an evening commute home on the I-85. The school lunch can only be described as a weeks ago bread. Every day you walk/drive home exhausted. Some days I would come home not remembering anything at school. I would always question myself.\n\nThe hardest part about a high school life is to get past the distraction you face every-day. Walking to class in the traffic filled hallway, my lungs rapidly pace itself, my muscle straining itself, and all to do what. Walk through the hall. So much work just to walk in the hallway. Why it is that people like to hang out at the doorway. No common sense. Doors are meant for walking through, not standing and blocking it while people try to push their ways across.\n\nOut of all the little distraction I face every-day, one challenge still remain. What would I do after high school? After 4 years of high school I can still not make up my mind. There are many options but I cannot pick which is the best for me. What college should I go to, what field should I do what about the military? All the questions I want to answer but simply cannot.\n\nIn conclusion, I am currently trying my best to figure out what to do with my life after high school. I do not know whether I am going to which college or if I am to attend the military. Whatever happens in the future will happen depending on my actions this year. After all what is the point of a challenge if it doesn\u2019t make you try your best.Prompt: Discuss a place that has changed you\n\nHave you ever been told that the whole point of life is learning to live with the consequences of the bad decisions we\u2019ve made. It only takes a place and a wrong decision to change your life around and sometimes your future plans. To me it all happened around the end of the school year of senior year. I was a 16 year old girl attending Berkmar High School. I decided to drop out of high school to have a job and depend on myself because of family problems I had a sick dad who got fire and a stepmom who only work part time. My only choice was to help and hold down my family. Dropping out of high school is an issue face by many teens today including me unfortunately. There are many causes to drop out of school but with those causes come many negative effects. Out of those effects I learn that school is really important and brightens anyone\u2019s future as so makes our career easy.\n\nSchool was really a waste of time for me. I had zero interest. I\u2019m sure school is a huge benefit if you are actually interested. But it only was making me angry and depressed. I honestly never thought I would drop out of high school. I loved school; I love learning, being organized and the socializing when I was in elementary school to middle school. Things change; sometimes they changed in bad ways. I was very hurt and felt like I was worthless for not being able to continue my education I was basically committed to demonstrate to my family and friends that I was that one person with honors cords and the crowd cheering me while I walk to receive my diploma. A lot of those people were disappointed at me. I felt like I was the definition of a high school dropout. At that point I decided to help my family out since money was needed around that year. I told my dad my decision and he agree he said he understands I want to help them out but he told me I had to promise I will come back to school and graduate. As a teen I just want the best for me and my future family so of course I will be a high school graduate and a collage graduate as well.\n\nThere are many reasons why any dropout decides school is not for them as many people say now days. I was once one of them. I kept telling myself that I wouldn\u2019t graduate on time I was already behind. All those negative thoughts made me not believe in me anymore. I started skipping classes. I didn\u2019t care about school anymore, I didn\u2019t care about my grades anymore not even the classes I was doing good at. At the end of the year I decided to drop out what the point of going to classes is when I was already failing them I kept asking myself. Until the day came when I decided to not go to school anymore and be welcome to the real life \u201chaving a job and depending on you.\u201d\n\nDuring that time I was struggling to find a job. I felt like nobody was there for me. Everybody was still going to school to finish what I couldn\u2019t finish my junior year. I felt left behind alone and helpless until I met a friend who works as a waitress. I told her what was going on and if she could help me find a place to work at her job. Finally they hire me at her job at that point I was really happy and felt like everything was getting better. I hated working every day from 2pm-2am I got home really tired I wanted to give up but I would have felt like a loser until I realize how hard and stressful is to work. To remind you it was my first job at age 16. I hated the job I knew this wasn\u2019t for me that\u2019s when I realize and open my eyes and told myself what was I doing here. I rather wanted to be at school then working somewhere I hated it.\n\nFinally summer came I decided to go to summer school and finish some classes. I was doing goo still manage to go to work. Then finalyPrompt: ?\n\nThe smell of salt in the air and women in bikinis all around us. What would you think your at? The beach of course a place where most would spend spring break at or for just relaxation. This place I know well is Myrtle Beach, SC just place I can\u2019t forget. I do have feelings for this place I didn\u2019t spend much time their but I really have somewhere in my heart I could not forget.\n\nTo start off why this place means something to me is because my dad choose this play to spend time there as a family, well now since he is not with us anymore that place is just a reminder of my pops. Not just of the memories I have of it is special it is also a beautiful resort I would recommend to others to enjoy. With its crystal blue waters and a great view of the atlantic ocean something you can\u2019t see everyday.\u201cDad, where\u2019s mom\u201d I asked. My dad looks over, sighs, and says to me \u201cShe\u2019s Working son. She\u2019ll be home later\u201d. I\u2019d look up at him, and see my dad smile at me like there\u2019s nothing wrong, and hug me. My dad knows that I and my sister know that she\u2019s been leaving. He didn\u2019t want us to worry because we were just kids. So he\u2019d make up things like \u201cShe\u2019s working\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s at the store\u201d. My dad was having a hard accepting the she was leaving, and so were we. Abandonment doesn\u2019t just affect the other parent but the kids as well.\n\nAs a kid I knew something was wrong but I didn\u2019t know what. I could hear yelling from my parents especially from my dad. I\u2019d hear bits of what they were saying. My dad \u201cYou need to stop\u2026.\u201d My mom \u201cI\u2019m going\u2026.\u201d I hear a door slam and just curl up in my bed, blanket covering me, hiding. My mother was like any other mom working, cooking, cleaning, etc. then she got into gambling. At my age I didn\u2019t know what that was. A little after that she would go missing. It started with a couple of days to weeks. I don\u2019t know what my mom was thinking. She had five kids my older sister, me, my little sister, and twin boys. My mother had taken up a gambling problem. My mother would take my dad\u2019s money and go to a casino. Win or lose she\u2019d go. She lost so much at one point that we lost our house. Not just that house but two more after that. She\u2019d come back to my dad all broke, but he wouldn\u2019t care because he loved her. Once she was back the cycle would happen again. This happened until we were going to another house and she brought along her \u201cfriend\u201d. I say \u201cfriend\u201d because she told my dad he was just a friend but in reality she played him. That \u201cfriend\u201d turned out to be the guy she ran off with. Him over my dad. It left my dad devastated.\n\nMy dad had a hard time accepting that she had left him for another man. That she had gave up on her husband and kids. He couldn\u2019t handle the fact she had did not want him. My father wasn\u2019t the same after that. He\u2019d throw himself into work. If he was home he\u2019d be working on something. He became silent not talking. My dad has never been through this. So he didn\u2019t know how to deal with something like this. How can you. The night that he found out that she was leaving I found my dad in his room crying. My father is crying. I couldn\u2019t help but just hug him. It was my dad. A man I never thought can cry. I found him at the edge of his bed shaking his head while slow tears just falling from his cheeks. He hears me come in with my older sister, and tries to wipe up his tears. Saying he\u2019s fine don\u2019t worry. My dad is a very prideful person. He never wanted us to see him weak or down so he would always be happy no matter what. It was just sad because he wasn\u2019t the only person who was struggling. My sister and I were too\n\nLike my dad I was having a hard time dealing with this issue. I felt it was my fault. Like I could\u2019ve done something to change what happened. Like what can I do to bring her back. What can I do. I had many trust issues built on this. I didn\u2019t trust anyone because I felt as if they weren\u2019t telling the truth. I didn\u2019t trust that people would stay in my life. I felt like what\u2019s next to go, my dad. I felt like I could never believe in happily ever after. I thought I will be alone all my life. I became emotionally depressed. Because my mother had left with no emotion at all. Just packed up and left. This was the moment I felt abandoned. From there I isolated myself from everyone and everything. I didn\u2019t want to let people come into my life and just leave like she did. I built my wall to keep anyone from getting in friends, family anyone. I\u2019ve been like this for years but keep it to myself. I didn\u2019t feel the need to open up to anyone.\nYears passed by now and I\u2019m eighteen now. I still have issues but I\u2019m trying to get passed it. I\u2019ve accepted she has left. I\u2019ve been trying to get back in life and experience it. I have a better perspective on thing and how they work. It hard but I found what I want to do and be in life. I want to be a psychologist. I want to be a psychologist because I want to help treat the minds of other so they don\u2019t have to feel like I have or bad in anyway. I made my goal out of this situation. My goal in life is to help anyone and everyone so they can be happy in life. It doesn\u2019t matter friends, family, strangers anyone that feels sad or mad or even alone. I want to help them.Prompt: ?\n\nOne of the places\u2019 I know best is where my parents were born and raised. This place is where I can find freedom. Every year I go visit I feel like an eagle soring throw the blue sky. My heart starts to race every time my family and I go visit. Every year we go visit my parents family, it shows me that family is what really matters in life.\nThe first year I visited my parents\u2019 home town was when I was ten years old. We had left the house around two in the morning on a Saturday night. That night my mom and dad where ready with the luggage and everything in my dad\u2019s ford f-350 (king ranch). My brother and sister had woken up when I walked in there room and told them to get ready so we could leave. While my brother and sister started to get read, my mom started to look for our passports, while my dad checked the truck for anything that might cause a problem with it.\n\nAfter my mom and dad had done everything they needed to do we headed off on the freeway. My brother and sister half asleep in the truck and, my mom and dad as well. Me on the other hand, my heart was still racing and just jumping with joy inside. My dad started driving and it would take us one full day and three more hours just to get to the border. My mom and dad toke turns drive and I also helped them out a little as well. After the long drive we finally reached the border and there were a lot of people there. The line to cross the border was very long, more than the down town Atlanta traffic is on a game day. After the 3 hours we spent at the border we were ready to hit the road again. It was my dad\u2019s turn to drive again, pulse he was the only one that know the shortest way to get there without taking the long way like last time.Prompt: ?\n\nThree specific things about me is I like American History, because you can learn so much about American in some many classes. So I want to go to college get my major in history and might become a teacher on day.\nAnother specific thing about me is that I\u2019m a hard working person, I ask questions we need, and always caring about each other. So I hope to keep that positive feeling with me till I die.\n\nThe Final specific thing about me is my family is Athletic, because my parents played sports while there were young and in high school. My sister is playing two sports right now Softball and Basketball, but I\u2019m the only person that doesn\u2019t play high school sports. But I still play sports after school.\nSo I hope that you let me in your University to played sport and be a positive student in life. Also to accomplish my goals I set while I\u2019m there.Prompt: ?\n\nDonald Trump wants to beat everyone in poles but where does he really stand in the economy? Lately all he has been arguing about is immigration insisting that Mexican immigrants were \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.\u201d and arguing Mexican immigrants bring \u201ctremendous infectious disease\u201d to the country, which is not true, not just that but threating tariffs because he is \u201crich\u201d as he claims in CNN news. \u201cI\u2019m rich and not using lobbyists. I\u2019m not using donors. I don\u2019t care I\u2019m rich\u201d and expects us to believe that he\u2019s really going to makes U.S.A a better place when he plans to hurt people and family\u2019s and doesn\u2019t care about other races other than the legal people whom according to him do not make crimes or are not spreading diseases\n\nAs many people have heard Donald Trump is working with Univision as head management in miss U.S.A pageant. as soon as this 20015 pageant ends he claims that he is not satisfied because of a \u201cnon-completed agreement in his contract.\u201d When in reality he is just trying to make an honest buck out of Univision that happened to be the biggest Hispanic news industry and the TNT network news interview him and ask him \u201cdo you regret the comments?\u201d Donald Trump: \u201dNot at all had I said people from all over the country\u201d TNT network: \u201chow much are you sewing them for?\u201d Donald Trump: \u201cI\u2019m sewing them for a tremendous amount of money for defamation\u201d when really the person who should be sewed for defamation is him for saying people from the middle east and Islamic people are destroying our country\n\nThe real question is do we really want a guy to run for America? He can barely hold his tongue when it\u2019s his turn to speak, just common sense as a child, even a child knows better. they know when they are permitted to speak and when they should start speaking and how without being rude if you ask me I believe Donald trump was a troubled child and still is today don\u2019t get it wrong he has good qualities but I still feel he shouldn\u2019t be given such a higher power when his idea of respect is as ideal as a three year old child.Late ArrivalsPrompt: Who is someone you look up to and why?\n\nThere are many different people that come in and out of your life. All of them teach you different things. Some come in to teach you how to survive, and others just to mess your life up. Many of the people that stay are the ones who love you and the ones you learn to love. The very two first people that will teach you everything are your parents. My prime example is my dad.\n\nMy dad is literally a pain in the neck when it comes to my studies and school work. He\u2019s always on my back when he comes home from work. \u201cKevin get off your phone, that\u2019s not helping you study!\u201d I always seem to make the same dumb mistake by saying,\u201d yeah dad I did that already.\u201d Usually he always likes checking my homework. He is such a perfectionist, doesn\u2019t like not even the slightest mistake. My dad is also always asking about my grades. Like any other parent he turns into a loud parakeet and yells at me if I have a bad grade, but never does he hit me for any reason.\nMy dad has probably taught me the most valuable things in life. When he was only fifteen years old, he was in the army back in El Salvador. After one year he decided to run away from the military and flee his country. When he arrived to the U.S. his mom told him he had to work, because she didn\u2019t have enough money for the both of them. My dad has been independent ever since. He always tells me how I should value my life and that I should appreciate that I have both my parents. With my dad I can play around but he\u2019s also showed me when it\u2019s time to be serious. My dad is like my mentor. He always pesters me about how I shouldn\u2019t do a lot of the things he did, because he doesn\u2019t want to see me suffering like he did.\n\nThis man has always been there for me. Blood is thicker than water they say, and my dad has proved that to me. There\u2019s never a time I don\u2019t like going out to work with my dad. he\u2019s taught me so much of the things he knows. Always says that when he dies he wants me to be known the way he is. My dad has never given me a bad example. Yes he may drink and stuff but he always likes to do it behind our backs so we won\u2019t see him. He\u2019s never offered us anything and even though he says you should try a lot of things at least once, the way he\u2019s raised me I could never. He has always been there for me and my family. Never had we had to suffer the way he did. There\u2019s always been a roof on our heads, clothes on our body, and food in our mouth. He may not seem like a big deal to you, but when I grow up I want to be just like my dad and if possible even better.\n\nI\u2019m very lucky to have a man like that in life. He has always stuck by my side no matter what. My dad has taught me what it\u2019s like to be a man. All the memories he\u2019s given me I will never forget. All the stories he\u2019s told me I hope to pass down to my kids. I want my dad to be remembered for an eternity. I look up to my dad because he\u2019s the greatest dad alive!I am uniquely qualified as a vet because of my love for animal\u2019s, past experience and achieving my goals and accomplishments.\nMy passion for animals is to love them in many ways, giving them their different needs. Figuring out the problems by performing good connections and communication. I am willing to heal the broken hearts and outer skins on the helpless animals and not only the pets but the pet owners.\n\nIn my 19 years I\u2019ve grown up with pets all my life, so I am aware of the requirements into keeping a pet and providing the right care for them, I\u2019ve learned that every day I am learning something new about different species and still want to continue to gain new knowledge.\n\nStudying animals all my life has also made me want to participate in an actual animal shelter, and maybe my own someday, I plan to better myself into the new things that come my way to help these animals and teach others the right way.essayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessay12Embed"}, {"name": "Kill V.

Hail, brave friend!\nSay to the king the knowledge of the broil\nAs thou didst leave it. 25Sergeant. Doubtful it stood;\nAs two spent swimmers, that do cling together\nAnd choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald\u2014\nWorthy to be a rebel, for to that\nThe multiplying villanies of nature 30\nDo swarm upon him\u2014from the western isles\nOf kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;\nAnd fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,\nShow'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:\nFor brave Macbeth\u2014well he deserves that name\u2014 35\nDisdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,\nWhich smoked with bloody execution,\nLike valour's minion carved out his passage\nTill he faced the slave;\nWhich ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him, 40\nTill he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,\nAnd fix'd his head upon our battlements.\nDuncan. O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!\nSergeant. As whence the sun 'gins his reflection\nShipwrecking storms and direful thunders break, 45\nSo from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come\nDiscomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:\nNo sooner justice had with valour arm'd\nCompell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,\nBut the Norweyan lord surveying vantage, 50\nWith furbish'd arms and new supplies of men\nBegan a fresh assault.\nDuncan. Dismay'd not this\nOur captains, Macbeth and Banquo?\nSergeant. Yes; 55\nAs sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.\nIf I say sooth, I must report they were\nAs cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they\nDoubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:\nExcept they meant to bathe in reeking wounds, 60\nOr memorise another Golgotha,\nI cannot tell.\nBut I am faint, my gashes cry for help.\nDuncan. So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;\nThey smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons. 65\n[Exit Sergeant, attended]\nWho comes here?\n[Enter ROSS]\nMalcolm. The worthy thane of Ross.\nLennox. What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look 70\nThat seems to speak things strange.\nRoss. God save the king!\nDuncan. Whence camest thou, worthy thane?\nRoss. From Fife, great king;\nWhere the Norweyan banners flout the sky 75\nAnd fan our people cold. Norway himself,\nWith terrible numbers,\nAssisted by that most disloyal traitor\nThe thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;\nTill that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof, 80\nConfronted him with self-comparisons,\nPoint against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.\nCurbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,\nThe victory fell on us.\nDuncan. Great happiness! 85Ross. That now\nSweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:\nNor would we deign him burial of his men\nTill he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch\nTen thousand dollars to our general use. 90Duncan. No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive\nOur bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,\nAnd with his former title greet Macbeth.\nRoss. I'll see it done.\nDuncan.

So foul and fair a day I have not seen.\nBanquo. How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these\nSo wither'd and so wild in their attire, 140\nThat look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,\nAnd yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught\nThat man may question? You seem to understand me,\nBy each at once her chappy finger laying\nUpon her skinny lips: you should be women, 145\nAnd yet your beards forbid me to interpret\nThat you are so.\nMacbeth. Speak, if you can: what are you?\nFirst Witch. All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!\nSecond Witch. All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor! 150Third Witch. All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!\nBanquo. Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear\nThings that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,\nAre ye fantastical, or that indeed\nWhich outwardly ye show? My noble partner 155\nYou greet with present grace and great prediction\nOf noble having and of royal hope,\nThat he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.\nIf you can look into the seeds of time,\nAnd say which grain will grow and which will not, 160\nSpeak then to me, who neither beg nor fear\nYour favours nor your hate.\nFirst Witch. Hail!\nSecond Witch. Hail!\nThird Witch. Hail! 165First Witch. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.\nSecond Witch. Not so happy, yet much happier.\nThird Witch. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:\nSo all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!\nFirst Witch. Banquo and Macbeth, all hail! 170Macbeth. Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:\nBy Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;\nBut how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,\nA prosperous gentleman; and to be king\nStands not within the prospect of belief, 175\nNo more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence\nYou owe this strange intelligence? or why\nUpon this blasted heath you stop our way\nWith such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.\n[Witches vanish]\n\nBanquo. The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,\nAnd these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?\nMacbeth. Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted\nAs breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!\nBanquo. Were such things here as we do speak about? 185\nOr have we eaten on the insane root\nThat takes the reason prisoner?\nMacbeth. Your children shall be kings.\nBanquo. You shall be king.\nMacbeth. And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so? 190Banquo. To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?\n[Enter ROSS and ANGUS]\n\nRoss. The king hath happily received, Macbeth,\nThe news of thy success; and when he reads\nThy personal venture in the rebels' fight, 195\nHis wonders and his praises do contend\nWhich should be thine or his: silenced with that,\nIn viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,\nHe finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,\nNothing afeard of what thyself didst make, 200\nStrange images of death. As thick as hail\nCame post with post; and every one did bear\nThy praises in his kingdom's great defence,\nAnd pour'd them down before him.\nAngus. We are sent 205\nTo give thee from our royal master thanks;\nOnly to herald thee into his sight,\nNot pay thee.\nRoss. And, for an earnest of a greater honour,\nHe bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor: 210\nIn which addition, hail, most worthy thane!\nFor it is thine.\nBanquo. What, can the devil speak true?\nMacbeth. The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me\nIn borrow'd robes? 215Angus. Who was the thane lives yet;\nBut under heavy judgment bears that life\nWhich he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined\nWith those of Norway, or did line the rebel\nWith hidden help and vantage, or that with both 220\nHe labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;\nBut treasons capital, confess'd and proved,\nHave overthrown him.\nMacbeth. [Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!\nThe greatest is behind. 225\n[To ROSS and ANGUS]\nThanks for your pains.\n[To BANQUO]\nDo you not hope your children shall be kings,\nWhen those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me 230\nPromised no less to them?\nBanquo. That trusted home\nMight yet enkindle you unto the crown,\nBesides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:\nAnd oftentimes, to win us to our harm, 235\nThe instruments of darkness tell us truths,\nWin us with honest trifles, to betray's\nIn deepest consequence.\nCousins, a word, I pray you.\nMacbeth. [Aside]. Two truths are told, 240\nAs happy prologues to the swelling act\nOf the imperial theme.\u2014I thank you, gentlemen.\n[Aside] This supernatural soliciting]\nCannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,\nWhy hath it given me earnest of success, 245\nCommencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:\nIf good, why do I yield to that suggestion\nWhose horrid image doth unfix my hair\nAnd make my seated heart knock at my ribs,\nAgainst the use of nature? Present fears 250\nAre less than horrible imaginings:\nMy thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,\nShakes so my single state of man that function\nIs smother'd in surmise, and nothing is\nBut what is not. 255Banquo. Look, how our partner's rapt.\nMacbeth. [Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,\nWithout my stir.\nBanquo. New horrors come upon him,\nLike our strange garments, cleave not to their mould 260\nBut with the aid of use.\nMacbeth. [Aside] Come what come may,\nTime and the hour runs through the roughest day.\nBanquo. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.\nMacbeth. Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought 265\nWith things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains\nAre register'd where every day I turn\nThe leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.\nThink upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,\nThe interim having weigh'd it, let us speak 270\nOur free hearts each to other.\nBanquo. Very gladly.\nMacbeth.

But I have spoke\nWith one that saw him die: who did report 280\nThat very frankly he confess'd his treasons,\nImplored your highness' pardon and set forth\nA deep repentance: nothing in his life\nBecame him like the leaving it; he died\nAs one that had been studied in his death 285\nTo throw away the dearest thing he owed,\nAs 'twere a careless trifle.\nDuncan. There's no art\nTo find the mind's construction in the face:\nHe was a gentleman on whom I built 290\nAn absolute trust.\n[Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS]\nO worthiest cousin!\nThe sin of my ingratitude even now\nWas heavy on me: thou art so far before 295\nThat swiftest wing of recompense is slow\nTo overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,\nThat the proportion both of thanks and payment\nMight have been mine! only I have left to say,\nMore is thy due than more than all can pay. 300Macbeth. The service and the loyalty I owe,\nIn doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part\nIs to receive our duties; and our duties\nAre to your throne and state children and servants,\nWhich do but what they should, by doing every thing 305\nSafe toward your love and honour.\nDuncan. Welcome hither:\nI have begun to plant thee, and will labour\nTo make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,\nThat hast no less deserved, nor must be known 310\nNo less to have done so, let me enfold thee\nAnd hold thee to my heart.\nBanquo. There if I grow,\nThe harvest is your own.\nDuncan. My plenteous joys, 315\nWanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves\nIn drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,\nAnd you whose places are the nearest, know\nWe will establish our estate upon\nOur eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter 320\nThe Prince of Cumberland; which honour must\nNot unaccompanied invest him only,\nBut signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine\nOn all deservers. From hence to Inverness,\nAnd bind us further to you. 325Macbeth. The rest is labour, which is not used for you:\nI'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful\nThe hearing of my wife with your approach;\nSo humbly take my leave.\nDuncan. My worthy Cawdor! 330Macbeth. [Aside] The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step\nOn which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,\nFor in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;\nLet not light see my black and deep desires:\nThe eye wink at the hand; yet let that be, 335\nWhich the eye fears, when it is done, to see.\n[Exit]\n\nDuncan. True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,\nAnd in his commendations I am fed;\nIt is a banquet to me.

Lay it\nto thy heart, and farewell.'\nGlamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be\nWhat thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature; 360\nIt is too full o' the milk of human kindness\nTo catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;\nArt not without ambition, but without\nThe illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,\nThat wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, 365\nAnd yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,\nThat which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;\nAnd that which rather thou dost fear to do\nThan wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,\nThat I may pour my spirits in thine ear; 370\nAnd chastise with the valour of my tongue\nAll that impedes thee from the golden round,\nWhich fate and metaphysical aid doth seem\nTo have thee crown'd withal.\n[Enter a Messenger] 375\nWhat is your tidings?\nMessenger. The king comes here to-night.\nLady Macbeth. Thou'rt mad to say it:\nIs not thy master with him? who, were't so,\nWould have inform'd for preparation. 380Messenger. So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:\nOne of my fellows had the speed of him,\nWho, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more\nThan would make up his message.\nLady Macbeth. Give him tending; 385\nHe brings great news.\n[Exit Messenger]\nThe raven himself is hoarse\nThat croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan\nUnder my battlements. Come, you spirits 390\nThat tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,\nAnd fill me from the crown to the toe top-full\nOf direst cruelty! make thick my blood;\nStop up the access and passage to remorse,\nThat no compunctious visitings of nature 395\nShake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between\nThe effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,\nAnd take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,\nWherever in your sightless substances\nYou wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night, 400\nAnd pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,\nThat my keen knife see not the wound it makes,\nNor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,\nTo cry 'Hold, hold!'\n[Enter MACBETH] 405\nGreat Glamis! worthy Cawdor!\nGreater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!\nThy letters have transported me beyond\nThis ignorant present, and I feel now\nThe future in the instant. 410Macbeth. My dearest love,\nDuncan comes here to-night.\nLady Macbeth. And when goes hence?\nMacbeth. To-morrow, as he purposes.\nLady Macbeth. O, never 415\nShall sun that morrow see!\nYour face, my thane, is as a book where men\nMay read strange matters. To beguile the time,\nLook like the time; bear welcome in your eye,\nYour hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower, 420\nBut be the serpent under't. He that's coming\nMust be provided for: and you shall put\nThis night's great business into my dispatch;\nWhich shall to all our nights and days to come\nGive solely sovereign sway and masterdom. 425Macbeth. We will speak further.\nLady Macbeth.

This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air\nNimbly and sweetly recommends itself\nUnto our gentle senses. 435Banquo. This guest of summer,\nThe temple-haunting martlet, does approve,\nBy his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath\nSmells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,\nButtress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird 440\nHath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:\nWhere they most breed and haunt, I have observed,\nThe air is delicate.\n[Enter LADY MACBETH]\n\nDuncan. See, see, our honour'd hostess! 445\nThe love that follows us sometime is our trouble,\nWhich still we thank as love. Herein I teach you\nHow you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,\nAnd thank us for your trouble.\nLady Macbeth. All our service 450\nIn every point twice done and then done double\nWere poor and single business to contend\nAgainst those honours deep and broad wherewith\nYour majesty loads our house: for those of old,\nAnd the late dignities heap'd up to them, 455\nWe rest your hermits.\nDuncan. Where's the thane of Cawdor?\nWe coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose\nTo be his purveyor: but he rides well;\nAnd his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him 460\nTo his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,\nWe are your guest to-night.\nLady Macbeth. Your servants ever\nHave theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,\nTo make their audit at your highness' pleasure, 465\nStill to return your own.\nDuncan. Give me your hand;\nConduct me to mine host: we love him highly,\nAnd shall continue our graces towards him.\nBy your leave, hostess. 470[Exeunt]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act I, Scene 7\n\nMacbeth\u2019s castle.\nnext scene\n\n\n[Hautboys and torches.

If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well\nIt were done quickly: if the assassination 475\nCould trammel up the consequence, and catch\nWith his surcease success; that but this blow\nMight be the be-all and the end-all here,\nBut here, upon this bank and shoal of time,\nWe'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases 480\nWe still have judgment here; that we but teach\nBloody instructions, which, being taught, return\nTo plague the inventor: this even-handed justice\nCommends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice\nTo our own lips. He's here in double trust; 485\nFirst, as I am his kinsman and his subject,\nStrong both against the deed; then, as his host,\nWho should against his murderer shut the door,\nNot bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan\nHath borne his faculties so meek, hath been 490\nSo clear in his great office, that his virtues\nWill plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against\nThe deep damnation of his taking-off;\nAnd pity, like a naked new-born babe,\nStriding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed 495\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air,\nShall blow the horrid deed in every eye,\nThat tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur\nTo prick the sides of my intent, but only\nVaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself 500\nAnd falls on the other.\n[Enter LADY MACBETH]\nHow now! what news?\nLady Macbeth. He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?\nMacbeth. Hath he ask'd for me? 505Lady Macbeth. Know you not he has?\nMacbeth. We will proceed no further in this business:\nHe hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought\nGolden opinions from all sorts of people,\nWhich would be worn now in their newest gloss, 510\nNot cast aside so soon.\nLady Macbeth. Was the hope drunk\nWherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?\nAnd wakes it now, to look so green and pale\nAt what it did so freely? From this time 515\nSuch I account thy love. Art thou afeard\nTo be the same in thine own act and valour\nAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that\nWhich thou esteem'st the ornament of life,\nAnd live a coward in thine own esteem, 520\nLetting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'\nLike the poor cat i' the adage?\nMacbeth. Prithee, peace:\nI dare do all that may become a man;\nWho dares do more is none. 525Lady Macbeth. What beast was't, then,\nThat made you break this enterprise to me?\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man;\nAnd, to be more than what you were, you would\nBe so much more the man. Nor time nor place 530\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\nThey have made themselves, and that their fitness now\nDoes unmake you. I have given suck, and know\nHow tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:\nI would, while it was smiling in my face, 535\nHave pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,\nAnd dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you\nHave done to this.\nMacbeth. If we should fail?\nLady Macbeth. We fail! 540\nBut screw your courage to the sticking-place,\nAnd we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep\u2014\nWhereto the rather shall his day's hard journey\nSoundly invite him\u2014his two chamberlains\nWill I with wine and wassail so convince 545\nThat memory, the warder of the brain,\nShall be a fume, and the receipt of reason\nA limbeck only: when in swinish sleep\nTheir drenched natures lie as in a death,\nWhat cannot you and I perform upon 550\nThe unguarded Duncan? what not put upon\nHis spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt\nOf our great quell?\nMacbeth. Bring forth men-children only;\nFor thy undaunted mettle should compose 555\nNothing but males. Will it not be received,\nWhen we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two\nOf his own chamber and used their very daggers,\nThat they have done't?\nLady Macbeth. Who dares receive it other, 560\nAs we shall make our griefs and clamour roar\nUpon his death?\nMacbeth. I am settled, and bend up\nEach corporal agent to this terrible feat.\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show: 565\nFalse face must hide what the false heart doth know.\n[Exeunt]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act II, Scene 1\n\nCourt of Macbeth\u2019s castle.\nnext scene\n\n\n[Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him]\n\nBanquo.

There's husbandry in heaven;\nTheir candles are all out. Take thee that too.\nA heavy summons lies like lead upon me, 575\nAnd yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,\nRestrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature\nGives way to in repose!\n[Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch]\nGive me my sword. 580\nWho's there?\nMacbeth. A friend.\nBanquo. What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:\nHe hath been in unusual pleasure, and\nSent forth great largess to your offices. 585\nThis diamond he greets your wife withal,\nBy the name of most kind hostess; and shut up\nIn measureless content.\nMacbeth. Being unprepared,\nOur will became the servant to defect; 590\nWhich else should free have wrought.\nBanquo. All's well.\nI dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:\nTo you they have show'd some truth.\nMacbeth. I think not of them: 595\nYet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,\nWe would spend it in some words upon that business,\nIf you would grant the time.\nBanquo. At your kind'st leisure.\nMacbeth. If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis, 600\nIt shall make honour for you.\nBanquo. So I lose none\nIn seeking to augment it, but still keep\nMy bosom franchised and allegiance clear,\nI shall be counsell'd. 605Macbeth. Good repose the while!\nBanquo. Thanks, sir: the like to you!\n[Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE]\n\nMacbeth. Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,\nShe strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed. 610\n[Exit Servant]\nIs this a dagger which I see before me,\nThe handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.\nI have thee not, and yet I see thee still.\nArt thou not, fatal vision, sensible 615\nTo feeling as to sight? or art thou but\nA dagger of the mind, a false creation,\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?\nI see thee yet, in form as palpable\nAs this which now I draw. 620\nThou marshall'st me the way that I was going;\nAnd such an instrument I was to use.\nMine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,\nOr else worth all the rest; I see thee still,\nAnd on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, 625\nWhich was not so before. There's no such thing:\nIt is the bloody business which informs\nThus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld\nNature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse\nThe curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates 630\nPale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,\nAlarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,\nWhose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.\nWith Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design\nMoves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth, 635\nHear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear\nThy very stones prate of my whereabout,\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\nWhich now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:\nWords to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. 640\n[A bell rings]\nI go, and it is done; the bell invites me.\nHear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell\nThat summons thee to heaven or to hell.\n[Exit]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act II, Scene 2\n\nThe same.\nnext scene\n\n\n[Enter LADY MACBETH]\n\nLady Macbeth. That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;\nWhat hath quench'd them hath given me fire.\nHark! Peace!\nIt was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman, 650\nWhich gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:\nThe doors are open; and the surfeited grooms\nDo mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd\ntheir possets,\nThat death and nature do contend about them, 655\nWhether they live or die.\nMacbeth. [Within] Who's there? what, ho!\nLady Macbeth. Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,\nAnd 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed\nConfounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready; 660\nHe could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled\nMy father as he slept, I had done't.\n[Enter MACBETH]\nMy husband!\nMacbeth. I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise? 665Lady Macbeth. I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.\nDid not you speak?\nMacbeth. When?\nLady Macbeth. Now.\nMacbeth. As I descended? 670Lady Macbeth. Ay.\nMacbeth. Hark!\nWho lies i' the second chamber?\nLady Macbeth. Donalbain.\nMacbeth. This is a sorry sight. 675[Looking on his hands]\n\nLady Macbeth. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.\nMacbeth. There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried\n'Murder!'\nThat they did wake each other: I stood and heard them: 680\nBut they did say their prayers, and address'd them\nAgain to sleep.\nLady Macbeth. There are two lodged together.\nMacbeth. One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;\nAs they had seen me with these hangman's hands. 685\nListening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'\nWhen they did say 'God bless us!'\nLady Macbeth. Consider it not so deeply.\nMacbeth. But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?\nI had most need of blessing, and 'Amen' 690\nStuck in my throat.\nLady Macbeth. These deeds must not be thought\nAfter these ways; so, it will make us mad.\nMacbeth. Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!\nMacbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep, 695\nSleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,\nThe death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,\nBalm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,\nChief nourisher in life's feast,\u2014\nLady Macbeth. What do you mean? 700Macbeth. Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:\n'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor\nShall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'\nLady Macbeth. Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,\nYou do unbend your noble strength, to think 705\nSo brainsickly of things. Go get some water,\nAnd wash this filthy witness from your hand.\nWhy did you bring these daggers from the place?\nThey must lie there: go carry them; and smear\nThe sleepy grooms with blood. 710Macbeth. I'll go no more:\nI am afraid to think what I have done;\nLook on't again I dare not.\nLady Macbeth. Infirm of purpose!\nGive me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead 715\nAre but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood\nThat fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,\nI'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;\nFor it must seem their guilt.\n[Exit. Knocking within]\n\nMacbeth. Whence is that knocking?\nHow is't with me, when every noise appals me?\nWhat hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.\nWill all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood\nClean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather 725\nThe multitudinous seas in incarnadine,\nMaking the green one red.\n[Re-enter LADY MACBETH]\n\nLady Macbeth. My hands are of your colour; but I shame\nTo wear a heart so white. 730\n[Knocking within]\nI hear a knocking\nAt the south entry: retire we to our chamber;\nA little water clears us of this deed:\nHow easy is it, then! Your constancy 735\nHath left you unattended.\n[Knocking within]\nHark! more knocking.\nGet on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,\nAnd show us to be watchers. Be not lost 740\nSo poorly in your thoughts.\nMacbeth. To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.\n[Knocking within]\nWake Duncan with thy knocking!

What are you? But\nthis place is too cold for hell.

I pray you, remember the porter.\n[Opens the gate]\n\n[Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX]\n\nMacduff. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,\nThat you do lie so late?\nPorter. 'Faith sir, we were carousing till the\nsecond cock: and drink, sir, is a great 785\nprovoker of three things.\nMacduff. What three things does drink especially provoke?\nPorter. Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and\nurine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;\nit provokes the desire, but it takes 790\naway the performance: therefore, much drink\nmay be said to be an equivocator with lechery:\nit makes him, and it mars him; it sets\nhim on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,\nand disheartens him; makes him stand to, and 795\nnot stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him\nin a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.\nMacduff. I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.\nPorter. That it did, sir, i' the very throat on\nme: but I requited him for his lie; and, I 800\nthink, being too strong for him, though he took\nup my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast\nhim.\nMacduff. Is thy master stirring?\n[Enter MACBETH] 805\nOur knocking has awaked him; here he comes.\nLennox. Good morrow, noble sir.\nMacbeth. Good morrow, both.\nMacduff. Is the king stirring, worthy thane?\nMacbeth. Not yet. 810Macduff. He did command me to call timely on him:\nI have almost slipp'd the hour.\nMacbeth. I'll bring you to him.\nMacduff. I know this is a joyful trouble to you;\nBut yet 'tis one. 815Macbeth. The labour we delight in physics pain.\nThis is the door.\nMacduff. I'll make so bold to call,\nFor 'tis my limited service.\n[Exit]\n\nLennox. Goes the king hence to-day?\nMacbeth. He does: he did appoint so.\nLennox. The night has been unruly: where we lay,\nOur chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,\nLamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death, 825\nAnd prophesying with accents terrible\nOf dire combustion and confused events\nNew hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird\nClamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth\nWas feverous and did shake. 830Macbeth. 'Twas a rough night.\nLennox. My young remembrance cannot parallel\nA fellow to it.\n[Re-enter MACDUFF]\n\nMacduff. O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart 835\nCannot conceive nor name thee!\nMacbeth. [with Lennox] What's the matter.\nMacduff. Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!\nMost sacrilegious murder hath broke ope\nThe Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence 840\nThe life o' the building!\nMacbeth.

Your royal father 's murder'd. 885Malcolm. O, by whom?\nLennox. Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:\nTheir hands and faces were an badged with blood;\nSo were their daggers, which unwiped we found\nUpon their pillows: 890\nThey stared, and were distracted; no man's life\nWas to be trusted with them.\nMacbeth. O, yet I do repent me of my fury,\nThat I did kill them.\nMacduff. Wherefore did you so? 895Macbeth. Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,\nLoyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:\nThe expedition my violent love\nOutrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,\nHis silver skin laced with his golden blood; 900\nAnd his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature\nFor ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,\nSteep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers\nUnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,\nThat had a heart to love, and in that heart 905\nCourage to make 's love known?\nLady Macbeth. Help me hence, ho!\nMacduff. Look to the lady.\nMalcolm. [Aside to DONALBAIN] Why do we hold our tongues,\nThat most may claim this argument for ours? 910Donalbain. [Aside to MALCOLM] What should be spoken here,\nwhere our fate,\nHid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?\nLet 's away;\nOur tears are not yet brew'd. 915Malcolm. [Aside to DONALBAIN] Nor our strong sorrow\nUpon the foot of motion.\nBanquo. Look to the lady:\n[LADY MACBETH is carried out]\nAnd when we have our naked frailties hid, 920\nThat suffer in exposure, let us meet,\nAnd question this most bloody piece of work,\nTo know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:\nIn the great hand of God I stand; and thence\nAgainst the undivulged pretence I fight 925\nOf treasonous malice.\nMacduff. And so do I.\nAll. So all.\nMacbeth. Let's briefly put on manly readiness,\nAnd meet i' the hall together. 930All. Well contented.\n[Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.]\n\nMalcolm. What will you do? Let's not consort with them:\nTo show an unfelt sorrow is an office\nWhich the false man does easy. I'll to England. 935Donalbain. To Ireland, I; our separated fortune\nShall keep us both the safer: where we are,\nThere's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,\nThe nearer bloody.\nMalcolm. This murderous shaft that's shot 940\nHath not yet lighted, and our safest way\nIs to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;\nAnd let us not be dainty of leave-taking,\nBut shift away: there's warrant in that theft\nWhich steals itself, when there's no mercy left. 945[Exeunt]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act II, Scene 4\n\nOutside Macbeth\u2019s castle.\nnext scene\n\n\n[Enter ROSS and an old Man]\n\nOld Man. Threescore and ten I can remember well:\nWithin the volume of which time I have seen\nHours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night 950\nHath trifled former knowings.\nRoss. Ah, good father,\nThou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,\nThreaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,\nAnd yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp: 955\nIs't night's predominance, or the day's shame,\nThat darkness does the face of earth entomb,\nWhen living light should kiss it?\nOld Man. 'Tis unnatural,\nEven like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last, 960\nA falcon, towering in her pride of place,\nWas by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.\nRoss. And Duncan's horses\u2014a thing most strange and certain\u2014\nBeauteous and swift, the minions of their race,\nTurn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out, 965\nContending 'gainst obedience, as they would make\nWar with mankind.\nOld Man. 'Tis said they eat each other.\nRoss. They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes\nThat look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff. 970\n[Enter MACDUFF]\nHow goes the world, sir, now?\nMacduff. Why, see you not?\nRoss. Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?\nMacduff. Those that Macbeth hath slain. 975Ross. Alas, the day!\nWhat good could they pretend?\nMacduff.

Well, I will thither.\nMacduff. Well, may you see things well done there: adieu! 995\nLest our old robes sit easier than our new!\nRoss. Farewell, father.\nOld Man.

Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,\nAs the weird women promised, and, I fear,\nThou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said\nIt should not stand in thy posterity, 1005\nBut that myself should be the root and father\nOf many kings. If there come truth from them\u2014\nAs upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine\u2014\nWhy, by the verities on thee made good,\nMay they not be my oracles as well, 1010\nAnd set me up in hope? But hush! no more.\n[Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY]\nMACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants]\nMacbeth. Here's our chief guest.\nLady Macbeth. If he had been forgotten, 1015\nIt had been as a gap in our great feast,\nAnd all-thing unbecoming.\nMacbeth. To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,\nAnd I'll request your presence.\nBanquo. Let your highness 1020\nCommand upon me; to the which my duties\nAre with a most indissoluble tie\nFor ever knit.\nMacbeth. Ride you this afternoon?\nBanquo. Ay, my good lord. 1025Macbeth. We should have else desired your good advice,\nWhich still hath been both grave and prosperous,\nIn this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.\nIs't far you ride?\nBanquo. As far, my lord, as will fill up the time 1030\n'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,\nI must become a borrower of the night\nFor a dark hour or twain.\nMacbeth. Fail not our feast.\nBanquo. My lord, I will not. 1035Macbeth. We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd\nIn England and in Ireland, not confessing\nTheir cruel parricide, filling their hearers\nWith strange invention: but of that to-morrow,\nWhen therewithal we shall have cause of state 1040\nCraving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,\nTill you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?\nBanquo. Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.\nMacbeth. I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;\nAnd so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell. 1045\n[Exit BANQUO]\nLet every man be master of his time\nTill seven at night: to make society\nThe sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself\nTill supper-time alone: while then, God be with you! 1050\n[Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant]\nSirrah, a word with you: attend those men\nOur pleasure?\nAttendant. They are, my lord, without the palace gate.\nMacbeth. Bring them before us. 1055\n[Exit Attendant]\nTo be thus is nothing;\nBut to be safely thus.\u2014Our fears in Banquo\nStick deep; and in his royalty of nature\nReigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares; 1060\nAnd, to that dauntless temper of his mind,\nHe hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour\nTo act in safety. There is none but he\nWhose being I do fear: and, under him,\nMy Genius is rebuked; as, it is said, 1065\nMark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters\nWhen first they put the name of king upon me,\nAnd bade them speak to him: then prophet-like\nThey hail'd him father to a line of kings:\nUpon my head they placed a fruitless crown, 1070\nAnd put a barren sceptre in my gripe,\nThence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,\nNo son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,\nFor Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;\nFor them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd; 1075\nPut rancours in the vessel of my peace\nOnly for them; and mine eternal jewel\nGiven to the common enemy of man,\nTo make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!\nRather than so, come fate into the list. 1080\nAnd champion me to the utterance! Who's there!\n[Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers]\nNow go to the door, and stay there till we call.\n[Exit Attendant]\nWas it not yesterday we spoke together? 1085First Murderer. It was, so please your highness.\nMacbeth. Well then, now\nHave you consider'd of my speeches? Know\nThat it was he in the times past which held you\nSo under fortune, which you thought had been 1090\nOur innocent self: this I made good to you\nIn our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,\nHow you were borne in hand, how cross'd,\nthe instruments,\nWho wrought with them, and all things else that might 1095\nTo half a soul and to a notion crazed\nSay 'Thus did Banquo.'\nFirst Murderer. You made it known to us.\nMacbeth. I did so, and went further, which is now\nOur point of second meeting. Do you find 1100\nYour patience so predominant in your nature\nThat you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd\nTo pray for this good man and for his issue,\nWhose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave\nAnd beggar'd yours for ever? 1105First Murderer. We are men, my liege.\nMacbeth. Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;\nAs hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\nShoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept\nAll by the name of dogs: the valued file 1110\nDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,\nThe housekeeper, the hunter, every one\nAccording to the gift which bounteous nature\nHath in him closed; whereby he does receive\nParticular addition. from the bill 1115\nThat writes them all alike: and so of men.\nNow, if you have a station in the file,\nNot i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;\nAnd I will put that business in your bosoms,\nWhose execution takes your enemy off, 1120\nGrapples you to the heart and love of us,\nWho wear our health but sickly in his life,\nWhich in his death were perfect.\nSecond Murderer. I am one, my liege,\nWhom the vile blows and buffets of the world 1125\nHave so incensed that I am reckless what\nI do to spite the world.\nFirst Murderer. And I another\nSo weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,\nThat I would set my lie on any chance, 1130\nTo mend it, or be rid on't.\nMacbeth. Both of you\nKnow Banquo was your enemy.\nFirst Murderer. [with Second Murderer] True, my lord.\nMacbeth. So is he mine; and in such bloody distance, 1135\nThat every minute of his being thrusts\nAgainst my near'st of life: and though I could\nWith barefaced power sweep him from my sight\nAnd bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,\nFor certain friends that are both his and mine, 1140\nWhose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall\nWho I myself struck down; and thence it is,\nThat I to your assistance do make love,\nMasking the business from the common eye\nFor sundry weighty reasons. 1145Second Murderer. We shall, my lord,\nPerform what you command us.\nFirst Murderer. Though our lives\u2014\nMacbeth. Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most\nI will advise you where to plant yourselves; 1150\nAcquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,\nThe moment on't; for't must be done to-night,\nAnd something from the palace; always thought\nThat I require a clearness: and with him\u2014\nTo leave no rubs nor botches in the work\u2014 1155\nFleance his son, that keeps him company,\nWhose absence is no less material to me\nThan is his father's, must embrace the fate\nOf that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:\nI'll come to you anon. 1160First Murderer. [With Second Murderer] We are resolved, my lord.\nMacbeth. I'll call upon you straight: abide within.\n[Exeunt Murderers]\nIt is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,\nIf it find heaven, must find it out to-night. 1165[Exit]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act III, Scene 2\n\nThe palace.\nnext scene\n\n\n[Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant]\n\nLady Macbeth. Is Banquo gone from court?\nServant. Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.\nLady Macbeth. Say to the king, I would attend his leisure 1170\nFor a few words.\nServant. Madam, I will.\n[Exit]\n\nLady Macbeth. Nought's had, all's spent,\nWhere our desire is got without content: 1175\n'Tis safer to be that which we destroy\nThan by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.\n[Enter MACBETH]\nHow now, my lord! why do you keep alone,\nOf sorriest fancies your companions making, 1180\nUsing those thoughts which should indeed have died\nWith them they think on? Things without all remedy\nShould be without regard: what's done is done.\nMacbeth. We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:\nShe'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice 1185\nRemains in danger of her former tooth.\nBut let the frame of things disjoint, both the\nworlds suffer,\nEre we will eat our meal in fear and sleep\nIn the affliction of these terrible dreams 1190\nThat shake us nightly: better be with the dead,\nWhom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,\nThan on the torture of the mind to lie\nIn restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;\nAfter life's fitful fever he sleeps well; 1195\nTreason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,\nMalice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,\nCan touch him further.\nLady Macbeth. Come on;\nGentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks; 1200\nBe bright and jovial among your guests to-night.\nMacbeth. So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:\nLet your remembrance apply to Banquo;\nPresent him eminence, both with eye and tongue:\nUnsafe the while, that we 1205\nMust lave our honours in these flattering streams,\nAnd make our faces vizards to our hearts,\nDisguising what they are.\nLady Macbeth. You must leave this.\nMacbeth. O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! 1210\nThou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.\nLady Macbeth. But in them nature's copy's not eterne.\nMacbeth. There's comfort yet; they are assailable;\nThen be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown\nHis cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons 1215\nThe shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums\nHath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done\nA deed of dreadful note.\nLady Macbeth. What's to be done?\nMacbeth. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, 1220\nTill thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,\nScarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;\nAnd with thy bloody and invisible hand\nCancel and tear to pieces that great bond\nWhich keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow 1225\nMakes wing to the rooky wood:\nGood things of day begin to droop and drowse;\nWhile night's black agents to their preys do rouse.\nThou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;\nThings bad begun make strong themselves by ill. 1230\nSo, prithee, go with me.\n[Exeunt]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act III, Scene 3\n\nA park near the palace.\nnext scene\n\n\n[Enter three Murderers]\n\nFirst Murderer.

Then stand with us.\nThe west yet glimmers with some streaks of day: 1240\nNow spurs the lated traveller apace\nTo gain the timely inn; and near approaches\nThe subject of our watch.\nThird Murderer. Hark! I hear horses.\nBanquo. [Within] Give us a light there, ho! 1245Second Murderer. Then 'tis he: the rest\nThat are within the note of expectation\nAlready are i' the court.\nFirst Murderer. His horses go about.\nThird Murderer. Almost a mile: but he does usually, 1250\nSo all men do, from hence to the palace gate\nMake it their walk.\nSecond Murderer. A light, a light!\n[Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch]\n\nThird Murderer. 'Tis he. 1255First Murderer. Stand to't.\nBanquo. It will be rain to-night.\nFirst Murderer.

Ourself will mingle with society, 1275\nAnd play the humble host.\nOur hostess keeps her state, but in best time\nWe will require her welcome.\nLady Macbeth. Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;\nFor my heart speaks they are welcome. 1280[First Murderer appears at the door]\n\nMacbeth. See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.\nBoth sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:\nBe large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure\nThe table round. 1285\n[Approaching the door]\nThere's blood on thy face.\nFirst Murderer. 'Tis Banquo's then.\nMacbeth. 'Tis better thee without than he within.\nIs he dispatch'd? 1290First Murderer. My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.\nMacbeth. Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good\nThat did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,\nThou art the nonpareil.\nFirst Murderer. Most royal sir, 1295\nFleance is 'scaped.\nMacbeth. Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,\nWhole as the marble, founded as the rock,\nAs broad and general as the casing air:\nBut now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in 1300\nTo saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?\nFirst Murderer. Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,\nWith twenty trenched gashes on his head;\nThe least a death to nature.\nMacbeth. Thanks for that: 1305\nThere the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled\nHath nature that in time will venom breed,\nNo teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow\nWe'll hear, ourselves, again.\n[Exit Murderer]\n\nLady Macbeth. My royal lord,\nYou do not give the cheer: the feast is sold\nThat is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,\n'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;\nFrom thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; 1315\nMeeting were bare without it.\nMacbeth. Sweet remembrancer!\nNow, good digestion wait on appetite,\nAnd health on both!\nLennox. May't please your highness sit. 1320\n[The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in]\nMACBETH's place]\nMacbeth. Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,\nWere the graced person of our Banquo present;\nWho may I rather challenge for unkindness 1325\nThan pity for mischance!\nRoss. His absence, sir,\nLays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness\nTo grace us with your royal company.\nMacbeth. The table's full. 1330Lennox. Here is a place reserved, sir.\nMacbeth. Where?\nLennox. Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?\nMacbeth. Which of you have done this?\nLords. What, my good lord? 1335Macbeth. Thou canst not say I did it: never shake\nThy gory locks at me.\nRoss. Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.\nLady Macbeth. Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,\nAnd hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat; 1340\nThe fit is momentary; upon a thought\nHe will again be well: if much you note him,\nYou shall offend him and extend his passion:\nFeed, and regard him not. Are you a man?\nMacbeth. Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that 1345\nWhich might appal the devil.\nLady Macbeth. O proper stuff!\nThis is the very painting of your fear:\nThis is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,\nLed you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts, 1350\nImpostors to true fear, would well become\nA woman's story at a winter's fire,\nAuthorized by her grandam. Shame itself!\nWhy do you make such faces? When all's done,\nYou look but on a stool. 1355Macbeth. Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!\nhow say you?\nWhy, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.\nIf charnel-houses and our graves must send\nThose that we bury back, our monuments 1360\nShall be the maws of kites.\n[GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes]\n\nLady Macbeth. What, quite unmann'd in folly?\nMacbeth. If I stand here, I saw him.\nLady Macbeth. Fie, for shame! 1365Macbeth. Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,\nEre human statute purged the gentle weal;\nAy, and since too, murders have been perform'd\nToo terrible for the ear: the times have been,\nThat, when the brains were out, the man would die, 1370\nAnd there an end; but now they rise again,\nWith twenty mortal murders on their crowns,\nAnd push us from our stools: this is more strange\nThan such a murder is.\nLady Macbeth. My worthy lord, 1375\nYour noble friends do lack you.\nMacbeth. I do forget.\nDo not muse at me, my most worthy friends,\nI have a strange infirmity, which is nothing\nTo those that know me. Come, love and health to all; 1380\nThen I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.\nI drink to the general joy o' the whole table,\nAnd to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;\nWould he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,\nAnd all to all. 1385Lords. Our duties, and the pledge.\n[Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO]\n\nMacbeth. Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!\nThy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;\nThou hast no speculation in those eyes 1390\nWhich thou dost glare with!\nLady Macbeth. Think of this, good peers,\nBut as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;\nOnly it spoils the pleasure of the time.\nMacbeth. What man dare, I dare: 1395\nApproach thou like the rugged Russian bear,\nThe arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;\nTake any shape but that, and my firm nerves\nShall never tremble: or be alive again,\nAnd dare me to the desert with thy sword; 1400\nIf trembling I inhabit then, protest me\nThe baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!\nUnreal mockery, hence!\n[GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes]\nWhy, so: being gone, 1405\nI am a man again. Pray you, sit still.\nLady Macbeth. You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,\nWith most admired disorder.\nMacbeth. Can such things be,\nAnd overcome us like a summer's cloud, 1410\nWithout our special wonder? You make me strange\nEven to the disposition that I owe,\nWhen now I think you can behold such sights,\nAnd keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,\nWhen mine is blanched with fear. 1415Ross. What sights, my lord?\nLady Macbeth. I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;\nQuestion enrages him. At once, good night:\nStand not upon the order of your going,\nBut go at once. 1420Lennox. Good night; and better health\nAttend his majesty!\nLady Macbeth. A kind good night to all!\n[Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH]\n\nMacbeth. It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood: 1425\nStones have been known to move and trees to speak;\nAugurs and understood relations have\nBy magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth\nThe secret'st man of blood. What is the night?\nLady Macbeth. Almost at odds with morning, which is which. 1430Macbeth. How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person\nAt our great bidding?\nLady Macbeth. Did you send to him, sir?\nMacbeth. I hear it by the way; but I will send:\nThere's not a one of them but in his house 1435\nI keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,\nAnd betimes I will, to the weird sisters:\nMore shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,\nBy the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,\nAll causes shall give way: I am in blood 1440\nStepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,\nReturning were as tedious as go o'er:\nStrange things I have in head, that will to hand;\nWhich must be acted ere they may be scann'd.\nLady Macbeth. You lack the season of all natures, sleep. 1445Macbeth. Come, we'll to sleep.

My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,\nWhich can interpret further: only, I say,\nThings have been strangely borne. The\ngracious Duncan\nWas pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead: 1495\nAnd the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;\nWhom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,\nFor Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.\nWho cannot want the thought how monstrous\nIt was for Malcolm and for Donalbain 1500\nTo kill their gracious father? damned fact!\nHow it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight\nIn pious rage the two delinquents tear,\nThat were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?\nWas not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too; 1505\nFor 'twould have anger'd any heart alive\nTo hear the men deny't. So that, I say,\nHe has borne all things well: and I do think\nThat had he Duncan's sons under his key\u2014\nAs, an't please heaven, he shall not\u2014they 1510\nshould find\nWhat 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.\nBut, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd\nHis presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear\nMacduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell 1515\nWhere he bestows himself?\nLord. The son of Duncan,\nFrom whom this tyrant holds the due of birth\nLives in the English court, and is received\nOf the most pious Edward with such grace 1520\nThat the malevolence of fortune nothing\nTakes from his high respect: thither Macduff\nIs gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid\nTo wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:\nThat, by the help of these\u2014with Him above 1525\nTo ratify the work\u2014we may again\nGive to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,\nFree from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,\nDo faithful homage and receive free honours:\nAll which we pine for now: and this report 1530\nHath so exasperate the king that he\nPrepares for some attempt of war.\nLennox. Sent he to Macduff?\nLord. He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'\nThe cloudy messenger turns me his back, 1535\nAnd hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time\nThat clogs me with this answer.'\nLennox. And that well might\nAdvise him to a caution, to hold what distance\nHis wisdom can provide. Some holy angel 1540\nFly to the court of England and unfold\nHis message ere he come, that a swift blessing\nMay soon return to this our suffering country\nUnder a hand accursed!\nLord.

I conjure you, by that which you profess,\nHowe'er you come to know it, answer me:\nThough you untie the winds and let them fight\nAgainst the churches; though the yesty waves 1605\nConfound and swallow navigation up;\nThough bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;\nThough castles topple on their warders' heads;\nThough palaces and pyramids do slope\nTheir heads to their foundations; though the treasure 1610\nOf nature's germens tumble all together,\nEven till destruction sicken; answer me\nTo what I ask you.\nFirst Witch. Speak.\nSecond Witch. Demand. 1615Third Witch. We'll answer.\nFirst Witch. Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,\nOr from our masters?\nMacbeth. Call 'em; let me see 'em.\nFirst Witch. Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten 1620\nHer nine farrow; grease that's sweaten\nFrom the murderer's gibbet throw\nInto the flame.\nAll.

He knows thy thought:\nHear his speech, but say thou nought.\nFirst Apparition. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff; 1630\nBeware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.\n[Descends]\n\nMacbeth. Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;\nThou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one\nword more,\u2014 1635First Witch. He will not be commanded: here's another,\nMore potent than the first.\n[Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child]\n\nSecond Apparition. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!\nMacbeth. Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee. 1640Second Apparition. Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn\nThe power of man, for none of woman born\nShall harm Macbeth.\n[Descends]\n\nMacbeth. Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee? 1645\nBut yet I'll make assurance double sure,\nAnd take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;\nThat I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,\nAnd sleep in spite of thunder.\n[Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand] 1650\nWhat is this\nThat rises like the issue of a king,\nAnd wears upon his baby-brow the round\nAnd top of sovereignty?\nAll. Listen, but speak not to't. 1655Third Apparition. Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care\nWho chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:\nMacbeth shall never vanquish'd be until\nGreat Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill\nShall come against him. 1660[Descends]\n\nMacbeth.

Sweet bodements! good!\nRebellion's head, rise never till the wood 1665\nOf Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth\nShall live the lease of nature, pay his breath\nTo time and mortal custom. Yet my heart\nThrobs to know one thing: tell me, if your art\nCan tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever 1670\nReign in this kingdom?\nAll. Seek to know no more.\nMacbeth. I will be satisfied: deny me this,\nAnd an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.\nWhy sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this? 1675[Hautboys]\n\nFirst Witch. Show!\nSecond Witch. Show!\nThird Witch. Show!\nAll.

Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!\nThy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair, 1685\nThou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.\nA third is like the former. Filthy hags!\nWhy do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!\nWhat, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?\nAnother yet! A seventh! I'll see no more: 1690\nAnd yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass\nWhich shows me many more; and some I see\nThat two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:\nHorrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;\nFor the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me, 1695\nAnd points at them for his.\n[Apparitions vanish]\nWhat, is this so?\nFirst Witch. Ay, sir, all this is so: but why\nStands Macbeth thus amazedly? 1700\nCome, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,\nAnd show the best of our delights:\nI'll charm the air to give a sound,\nWhile you perform your antic round:\nThat this great king may kindly say, 1705\nOur duties did his welcome pay.\n[Music.

What's your grace's will?\nMacbeth. Saw you the weird sisters?\nLennox. No, my lord.\nMacbeth. Came they not by you? 1715Lennox. No, indeed, my lord.\nMacbeth. Infected be the air whereon they ride;\nAnd damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear\nThe galloping of horse: who was't came by?\nLennox. 'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word 1720\nMacduff is fled to England.\nMacbeth. Fled to England!\nLennox. Ay, my good lord.\nMacbeth. Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:\nThe flighty purpose never is o'ertook 1725\nUnless the deed go with it; from this moment\nThe very firstlings of my heart shall be\nThe firstlings of my hand. And even now,\nTo crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:\nThe castle of Macduff I will surprise; 1730\nSeize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword\nHis wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls\nThat trace him in his line.

He had none:\nHis flight was madness: when our actions do not,\nOur fears do make us traitors.\nRoss. You know not\nWhether it was his wisdom or his fear. 1745Lady Macduff. Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,\nHis mansion and his titles in a place\nFrom whence himself does fly? He loves us not;\nHe wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,\nThe most diminutive of birds, will fight, 1750\nHer young ones in her nest, against the owl.\nAll is the fear and nothing is the love;\nAs little is the wisdom, where the flight\nSo runs against all reason.\nRoss. My dearest coz, 1755\nI pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,\nHe is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows\nThe fits o' the season. I dare not speak\nmuch further;\nBut cruel are the times, when we are traitors 1760\nAnd do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour\nFrom what we fear, yet know not what we fear,\nBut float upon a wild and violent sea\nEach way and move. I take my leave of you:\nShall not be long but I'll be here again: 1765\nThings at the worst will cease, or else climb upward\nTo what they were before. My pretty cousin,\nBlessing upon you!\nLady Macduff. Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.\nRoss. I am so much a fool, should I stay longer, 1770\nIt would be my disgrace and your discomfort:\nI take my leave at once.\n[Exit]\n\nLady Macduff. Sirrah, your father's dead;\nAnd what will you do now? How will you live? 1775Son. As birds do, mother.\nLady Macduff. What, with worms and flies?\nSon. With what I get, I mean; and so do they.\nLady Macduff. Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,\nThe pitfall nor the gin. 1780Son. Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.\nMy father is not dead, for all your saying.\nLady Macduff. Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?\nSon. Nay, how will you do for a husband?\nLady Macduff. Why, I can buy me twenty at any market. 1785Son. Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.\nLady Macduff. Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,\nWith wit enough for thee.\nSon. Was my father a traitor, mother?\nLady Macduff. Ay, that he was. 1790Son. What is a traitor?\nLady Macduff. Why, one that swears and lies.\nSon. And be all traitors that do so?\nLady Macduff. Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.\nSon. And must they all be hanged that swear and lie? 1795Lady Macduff. Every one.\nSon. Who must hang them?\nLady Macduff. Why, the honest men.\nSon. Then the liars and swearers are fools,\nfor there are liars and swearers enow to beat 1800\nthe honest men and hang up them.\nLady Macduff. Now, God help thee, poor monkey!\nBut how wilt thou do for a father?\nSon. If he were dead, you'ld weep for\nhim: if you would not, it were a good sign 1805\nthat I should quickly have a new father.\nLady Macduff. Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!\n[Enter a Messenger]\n\nMessenger. Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,\nThough in your state of honour I am perfect. 1810\nI doubt some danger does approach you nearly:\nIf you will take a homely man's advice,\nBe not found here; hence, with your little ones.\nTo fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;\nTo do worse to you were fell cruelty, 1815\nWhich is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!\nI dare abide no longer.\n[Exit]\n\nLady Macduff. Whither should I fly?\nI have done no harm. But I remember now 1820\nI am in this earthly world; where to do harm\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\nAccounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,\nDo I put up that womanly defence,\nTo say I have done no harm? 1825\n[Enter Murderers]\nWhat are these faces?\nFirst Murderer. Where is your husband?\nLady Macduff. I hope, in no place so unsanctified\nWhere such as thou mayst find him. 1830First Murderer. He's a traitor.\nSon.

Let us rather\nHold fast the mortal sword, and like good men 1845\nBestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn\nNew widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows\nStrike heaven on the face, that it resounds\nAs if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out\nLike syllable of dolour. 1850Malcolm. What I believe I'll wail,\nWhat know believe, and what I can redress,\nAs I shall find the time to friend, I will.\nWhat you have spoke, it may be so perchance.\nThis tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, 1855\nWas once thought honest: you have loved him well.\nHe hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;\nbut something\nYou may deserve of him through me, and wisdom\nTo offer up a weak poor innocent lamb 1860\nTo appease an angry god.\nMacduff. I am not treacherous.\nMalcolm. But Macbeth is.\nA good and virtuous nature may recoil\nIn an imperial charge. But I shall crave 1865\nyour pardon;\nThat which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell;\nThough all things foul would wear the brows of grace,\nYet grace must still look so. 1870Macduff. I have lost my hopes.\nMalcolm. Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.\nWhy in that rawness left you wife and child,\nThose precious motives, those strong knots of love,\nWithout leave-taking? I pray you, 1875\nLet not my jealousies be your dishonours,\nBut mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,\nWhatever I shall think.\nMacduff. Bleed, bleed, poor country!\nGreat tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure, 1880\nFor goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou\nthy wrongs;\nThe title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:\nI would not be the villain that thou think'st\nFor the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp, 1885\nAnd the rich East to boot.\nMalcolm. Be not offended:\nI speak not as in absolute fear of you.\nI think our country sinks beneath the yoke;\nIt weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash 1890\nIs added to her wounds: I think withal\nThere would be hands uplifted in my right;\nAnd here from gracious England have I offer\nOf goodly thousands: but, for all this,\nWhen I shall tread upon the tyrant's head, 1895\nOr wear it on my sword, yet my poor country\nShall have more vices than it had before,\nMore suffer and more sundry ways than ever,\nBy him that shall succeed.\nMacduff. What should he be? 1900Malcolm. It is myself I mean: in whom I know\nAll the particulars of vice so grafted\nThat, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth\nWill seem as pure as snow, and the poor state\nEsteem him as a lamb, being compared 1905\nWith my confineless harms.\nMacduff. Not in the legions\nOf horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd\nIn evils to top Macbeth.\nMalcolm. I grant him bloody, 1910\nLuxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,\nSudden, malicious, smacking of every sin\nThat has a name: but there's no bottom, none,\nIn my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\nYour matrons and your maids, could not fill up 1915\nThe cistern of my lust, and my desire\nAll continent impediments would o'erbear\nThat did oppose my will: better Macbeth\nThan such an one to reign.\nMacduff. Boundless intemperance 1920\nIn nature is a tyranny; it hath been\nThe untimely emptying of the happy throne\nAnd fall of many kings. But fear not yet\nTo take upon you what is yours: you may\nConvey your pleasures in a spacious plenty, 1925\nAnd yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.\nWe have willing dames enough: there cannot be\nThat vulture in you, to devour so many\nAs will to greatness dedicate themselves,\nFinding it so inclined. 1930Malcolm. With this there grows\nIn my most ill-composed affection such\nA stanchless avarice that, were I king,\nI should cut off the nobles for their lands,\nDesire his jewels and this other's house: 1935\nAnd my more-having would be as a sauce\nTo make me hunger more; that I should forge\nQuarrels unjust against the good and loyal,\nDestroying them for wealth.\nMacduff. This avarice 1940\nSticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root\nThan summer-seeming lust, and it hath been\nThe sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;\nScotland hath foisons to fill up your will.\nOf your mere own: all these are portable, 1945\nWith other graces weigh'd.\nMalcolm. But I have none: the king-becoming graces,\nAs justice, verity, temperance, stableness,\nBounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,\nDevotion, patience, courage, fortitude, 1950\nI have no relish of them, but abound\nIn the division of each several crime,\nActing it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should\nPour the sweet milk of concord into hell,\nUproar the universal peace, confound 1955\nAll unity on earth.\nMacduff. O Scotland, Scotland!\nMalcolm. If such a one be fit to govern, speak:\nI am as I have spoken.\nMacduff. Fit to govern! 1960\nNo, not to live. O nation miserable,\nWith an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,\nSince that the truest issue of thy throne\nBy his own interdiction stands accursed, 1965\nAnd does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father\nWas a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,\nOftener upon her knees than on her feet,\nDied every day she lived. Fare thee well!\nThese evils thou repeat'st upon thyself 1970\nHave banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,\nThy hope ends here!\nMalcolm. Macduff, this noble passion,\nChild of integrity, hath from my soul\nWiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts 1975\nTo thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth\nBy many of these trains hath sought to win me\nInto his power, and modest wisdom plucks me\nFrom over-credulous haste: but God above\nDeal between thee and me! for even now 1980\nI put myself to thy direction, and\nUnspeak mine own detraction, here abjure\nThe taints and blames I laid upon myself,\nFor strangers to my nature. I am yet\nUnknown to woman, never was forsworn, 1985\nScarcely have coveted what was mine own,\nAt no time broke my faith, would not betray\nThe devil to his fellow and delight\nNo less in truth than life: my first false speaking\nWas this upon myself: what I am truly, 1990\nIs thine and my poor country's to command:\nWhither indeed, before thy here-approach,\nOld Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,\nAlready at a point, was setting forth.\nNow we'll together; and the chance of goodness 1995\nBe like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?\nMacduff. Such welcome and unwelcome things at once\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\n[Enter a Doctor]\n\nMalcolm. Well; more anon.\u2014Comes the king forth, I pray you? 2000Doctor. Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls\nThat stay his cure: their malady convinces\nThe great assay of art; but at his touch\u2014\nSuch sanctity hath heaven given his hand\u2014\nThey presently amend. 2005Malcolm. I thank you, doctor.\n[Exit Doctor]\n\nMacduff. What's the disease he means?\nMalcolm. 'Tis call'd the evil:\nA most miraculous work in this good king; 2010\nWhich often, since my here-remain in England,\nI have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,\nHimself best knows: but strangely-visited people,\nAll swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,\nThe mere despair of surgery, he cures, 2015\nHanging a golden stamp about their necks,\nPut on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,\nTo the succeeding royalty he leaves\nThe healing benediction. With this strange virtue,\nHe hath a heavenly gift of prophecy, 2020\nAnd sundry blessings hang about his throne,\nThat speak him full of grace.\n[Enter ROSS]\n\nMacduff. See, who comes here?\nMalcolm. My countryman; but yet I know him not. 2025Macduff. My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.\nMalcolm. I know him now. Good God, betimes remove\nThe means that makes us strangers!\nRoss. Sir, amen.\nMacduff. Stands Scotland where it did? 2030Ross. Alas, poor country!\nAlmost afraid to know itself. It cannot\nBe call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,\nBut who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;\nWhere sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air 2035\nAre made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems\nA modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell\nIs there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives\nExpire before the flowers in their caps,\nDying or ere they sicken. 2040Macduff. O, relation\nToo nice, and yet too true!\nMalcolm. What's the newest grief?\nRoss. That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:\nEach minute teems a new one. 2045Macduff. How does my wife?\nRoss. Why, well.\nMacduff. And all my children?\nRoss. Well too.\nMacduff. The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace? 2050Ross. No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.\nMacduff. But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?\nRoss. When I came hither to transport the tidings,\nWhich I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour\nOf many worthy fellows that were out; 2055\nWhich was to my belief witness'd the rather,\nFor that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:\nNow is the time of help; your eye in Scotland\nWould create soldiers, make our women fight,\nTo doff their dire distresses. 2060Malcolm. Be't their comfort\nWe are coming thither: gracious England hath\nLent us good Siward and ten thousand men;\nAn older and a better soldier none\nThat Christendom gives out. 2065Ross. Would I could answer\nThis comfort with the like! But I have words\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert air,\nWhere hearing should not latch them.\nMacduff. What concern they? 2070\nThe general cause? or is it a fee-grief\nDue to some single breast?\nRoss. No mind that's honest\nBut in it shares some woe; though the main part\nPertains to you alone. 2075Macduff. If it be mine,\nKeep it not from me, quickly let me have it.\nRoss. Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,\nWhich shall possess them with the heaviest sound\nThat ever yet they heard. 2080Macduff. Hum! I guess at it.\nRoss. Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes\nSavagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,\nWere, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,\nTo add the death of you. 2085Malcolm. Merciful heaven!\nWhat, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;\nGive sorrow words: the grief that does not speak\nWhispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.\nMacduff. My children too? 2090Ross. Wife, children, servants, all\nThat could be found.\nMacduff. And I must be from thence!\nMy wife kill'd too?\nRoss. I have said. 2095Malcolm. Be comforted:\nLet's make us medicines of our great revenge,\nTo cure this deadly grief.\nMacduff. He has no children. All my pretty ones?\nDid you say all? O hell-kite! All? 2100\nWhat, all my pretty chickens and their dam\nAt one fell swoop?\nMalcolm. Dispute it like a man.\nMacduff. I shall do so;\nBut I must also feel it as a man: 2105\nI cannot but remember such things were,\nThat were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,\nAnd would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,\nThey were all struck for thee! naught that I am,\nNot for their own demerits, but for mine, 2110\nFell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!\nMalcolm. Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief\nConvert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.\nMacduff. O, I could play the woman with mine eyes\nAnd braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens, 2115\nCut short all intermission; front to front\nBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\nWithin my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,\nHeaven forgive him too!\nMalcolm. This tune goes manly. 2120\nCome, go we to the king; our power is ready;\nOur lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth\nIs ripe for shaking, and the powers above\nPut on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:\nThe night is long that never finds the day. 2125[Exeunt]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act V, Scene 1\n\nDunsinane.

When was it she last walked?\nGentlewoman. Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen 2130\nher rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon\nher, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,\nwrite upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again\nreturn to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.\nDoctor. A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once 2135\nthe benefit of sleep, and do the effects of\nwatching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her\nwalking and other actual performances, what, at any\ntime, have you heard her say?\nGentlewoman. That, sir, which I will not report after her. 2140Doctor. You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.\nGentlewoman. Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to\nconfirm my speech.\n[Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper]\nLo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; 2145\nand, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.\nDoctor. How came she by that light?\nGentlewoman. Why, it stood by her: she has light by her\ncontinually; 'tis her command.\nDoctor. You see, her eyes are open. 2150Gentlewoman. Ay, but their sense is shut.\nDoctor. What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.\nGentlewoman. It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus\nwashing her hands: I have known her continue in\nthis a quarter of an hour. 2155Lady Macbeth. Yet here's a spot.\nDoctor. Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from\nher, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.\nLady Macbeth. Out, damned spot! out, I say!\u2014One: two: why,\nthen, 'tis time to do't.\u2014Hell is murky!\u2014Fie, my 2160\nlord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we\nfear who knows it, when none can call our power to\naccount?\u2014Yet who would have thought the old man\nto have had so much blood in him.\nDoctor. Do you mark that? 2165Lady Macbeth. The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?\u2014\nWhat, will these hands ne'er be clean?\u2014No more o'\nthat, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with\nthis starting.\nDoctor. Go to, go to; you have known what you should not. 2170Gentlewoman. She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of\nthat: heaven knows what she has known.\nLady Macbeth. Here's the smell of the blood still: all the\nperfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little\nhand. Oh, oh, oh! 2175Doctor. What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.\nGentlewoman. I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the\ndignity of the whole body.\nDoctor. Well, well, well,\u2014\nGentlewoman. Pray God it be, sir. 2180Doctor. This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known\nthose which have walked in their sleep who have died\nholily in their beds.\nLady Macbeth.

Will she go now to bed?\nGentlewoman. Directly.\nDoctor. Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds\nDo breed unnatural troubles: infected minds 2195\nTo their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:\nMore needs she the divine than the physician.\nGod, God forgive us all! Look after her;\nRemove from her the means of all annoyance,\nAnd still keep eyes upon her.

The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,\nHis uncle Siward and the good Macduff:\nRevenges burn in them; for their dear causes\nWould to the bleeding and the grim alarm 2210\nExcite the mortified man.\nAngus. Near Birnam wood\nShall we well meet them; that way are they coming.\nCaithness. Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?\nLennox. For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file 2215\nOf all the gentry: there is Siward's son,\nAnd many unrough youths that even now\nProtest their first of manhood.\nMenteith. What does the tyrant?\nCaithness. Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies: 2220\nSome say he's mad; others that lesser hate him\nDo call it valiant fury: but, for certain,\nHe cannot buckle his distemper'd cause\nWithin the belt of rule.\nAngus. Now does he feel 2225\nHis secret murders sticking on his hands;\nNow minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;\nThose he commands move only in command,\nNothing in love: now does he feel his title\nHang loose about him, like a giant's robe 2230\nUpon a dwarfish thief.\nMenteith. Who then shall blame\nHis pester'd senses to recoil and start,\nWhen all that is within him does condemn\nItself for being there? 2235Caithness. Well, march we on,\nTo give obedience where 'tis truly owed:\nMeet we the medicine of the sickly weal,\nAnd with him pour we in our country's purge\nEach drop of us. 2240Lennox. Or so much as it needs,\nTo dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.\nMake we our march towards Birnam.\n[Exeunt, marching]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act V, Scene 3\n\nDunsinane.

Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:\nTill Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,\nI cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?\nWas he not born of woman? The spirits that know\nAll mortal consequences have pronounced me thus: 2250\n'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman\nShall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,\nfalse thanes,\nAnd mingle with the English epicures:\nThe mind I sway by and the heart I bear 2255\nShall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.\n[Enter a Servant]\nThe devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!\nWhere got'st thou that goose look?\nServant. There is ten thousand\u2014 2260Macbeth. Geese, villain!\nServant. Soldiers, sir.\nMacbeth. Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,\nThou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?\nDeath of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine 2265\nAre counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?\nServant. The English force, so please you.\nMacbeth. Take thy face hence.\n[Exit Servant]\nSeyton!\u2014I am sick at heart, 2270\nWhen I behold\u2014Seyton, I say!\u2014This push\nWill cheer me ever, or disseat me now.\nI have lived long enough: my way of life\nIs fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;\nAnd that which should accompany old age, 2275\nAs honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,\nI must not look to have; but, in their stead,\nCurses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,\nWhich the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!\n[Enter SEYTON]\n\nSeyton. What is your gracious pleasure?\nMacbeth. What news more?\nSeyton. All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.\nMacbeth. I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.\nGive me my armour. 2285Seyton. 'Tis not needed yet.\nMacbeth. I'll put it on.\nSend out more horses; skirr the country round;\nHang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.\nHow does your patient, doctor? 2290Doctor. Not so sick, my lord,\nAs she is troubled with thick coming fancies,\nThat keep her from her rest.\nMacbeth. Cure her of that.\nCanst thou not minister to a mind diseased, 2295\nPluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,\nRaze out the written troubles of the brain\nAnd with some sweet oblivious antidote\nCleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff\nWhich weighs upon the heart? 2300Doctor. Therein the patient\nMust minister to himself.\nMacbeth. Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.\nCome, put mine armour on; give me my staff.\nSeyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me. 2305\nCome, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast\nThe water of my land, find her disease,\nAnd purge it to a sound and pristine health,\nI would applaud thee to the very echo,\nThat should applaud again.\u2014Pull't off, I say.\u2014 2310\nWhat rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,\nWould scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?\nDoctor. Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation\nMakes us hear something.\nMacbeth. Bring it after me. 2315\nI will not be afraid of death and bane,\nTill Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.\nDoctor. [Aside] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,\nProfit again should hardly draw me here.\n[Exeunt]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act V, Scene 4\n\nCountry near Birnam wood.\nnext scene\n\n\n[Drum and colours.

Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand\nThat chambers will be safe. 2325Menteith. We doubt it nothing.\nSiward. What wood is this before us?\nMenteith. The wood of Birnam.\nMalcolm. Let every soldier hew him down a bough\nAnd bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow 2330\nThe numbers of our host and make discovery\nErr in report of us.\nSoldiers. It shall be done.\nSiward. We learn no other but the confident tyrant\nKeeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure 2335\nOur setting down before 't.\nMalcolm. 'Tis his main hope:\nFor where there is advantage to be given,\nBoth more and less have given him the revolt,\nAnd none serve with him but constrained things 2340\nWhose hearts are absent too.\nMacduff. Let our just censures\nAttend the true event, and put we on\nIndustrious soldiership.\nSiward. The time approaches 2345\nThat will with due decision make us know\nWhat we shall say we have and what we owe.\nThoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,\nBut certain issue strokes must arbitrate:\nTowards which advance the war. 2350[Exeunt, marching]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act V, Scene 5\n\nDunsinane.

Hang out our banners on the outward walls;\nThe cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength\nWill laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie 2355\nTill famine and the ague eat them up:\nWere they not forced with those that should be ours,\nWe might have met them dareful, beard to beard,\nAnd beat them backward home.\n[A cry of women within] 2360\nWhat is that noise?\nSeyton. It is the cry of women, my good lord.\n[Exit]\n\nMacbeth. I have almost forgot the taste of fears;\nThe time has been, my senses would have cool'd 2365\nTo hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair\nWould at a dismal treatise rouse and stir\nAs life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;\nDireness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts\nCannot once start me. 2370\n[Re-enter SEYTON]\nWherefore was that cry?\nSeyton. The queen, my lord, is dead.\nMacbeth. She should have died hereafter;\nThere would have been a time for such a word. 2375\nTo-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day\nTo the last syllable of recorded time,\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! 2380\nLife's but a walking shadow, a poor player\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage\nAnd then is heard no more: it is a tale\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\nSignifying nothing. 2385\n[Enter a Messenger]\nThou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.\nMessenger. Gracious my lord,\nI should report that which I say I saw,\nBut know not how to do it. 2390Macbeth. Well, say, sir.\nMessenger. As I did stand my watch upon the hill,\nI look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,\nThe wood began to move.\nMacbeth. Liar and slave! 2395Messenger. Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:\nWithin this three mile may you see it coming;\nI say, a moving grove.\nMacbeth. If thou speak'st false,\nUpon the next tree shalt thou hang alive, 2400\nTill famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,\nI care not if thou dost for me as much.\nI pull in resolution, and begin\nTo doubt the equivocation of the fiend\nThat lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood 2405\nDo come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood\nComes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!\nIf this which he avouches does appear,\nThere is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.\nI gin to be aweary of the sun, 2410\nAnd wish the estate o' the world were now undone.\nRing the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!\nAt least we'll die with harness on our back.\n[Exeunt]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act V, Scene 6\n\nDunsinane. Before the castle.\nnext scene\n\n\n[Drum and colours.

You, worthy uncle,\nShall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,\nLead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we 2420\nShall take upon 's what else remains to do,\nAccording to our order.\nSiward. Fare you well.\nDo we but find the tyrant's power to-night,\nLet us be beaten, if we cannot fight. 2425Macduff. Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,\nThose clamorous harbingers of blood and death.\n[Exeunt]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act V, Scene 7\n\nAnother part of the field.\nnext scene\n\n\n[Alarums. Enter MACBETH]\n\nMacbeth. They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly, 2430\nBut, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he\nThat was not born of woman? Such a one\nAm I to fear, or none.\n[Enter YOUNG SIWARD]\n\nYoung Siward. What is thy name? 2435Macbeth. Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.\nYoung Siward. No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name\nThan any is in hell.\nMacbeth. My name's Macbeth.\nYoung Siward. The devil himself could not pronounce a title 2440\nMore hateful to mine ear.\nMacbeth. No, nor more fearful.\nYoung Siward. Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword\nI'll prove the lie thou speak'st.\n[They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain]\n\nMacbeth. Thou wast born of woman\nBut swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,\nBrandish'd by man that's of a woman born.\n[Exit]\n\n[Alarums. Enter MACDUFF]\n\nMacduff. That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!\nIf thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,\nMy wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.\nI cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms\nAre hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth, 2455\nOr else my sword with an unbatter'd edge\nI sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;\nBy this great clatter, one of greatest note\nSeems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!\nAnd more I beg not. 2460[Exit. Alarums]\n\n[Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD]\n\nSiward. This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:\nThe tyrant's people on both sides do fight;\nThe noble thanes do bravely in the war; 2465\nThe day almost itself professes yours,\nAnd little is to do.\nMalcolm. We have met with foes\nThat strike beside us.\nSiward. Enter, sir, the castle. 2470[Exeunt. Alarums]\n\n\n\nprevious scene         Act V, Scene 8\n\nAnother part of the field.\n\n\n\n[Enter MACBETH]\n\nMacbeth. Why should I play the Roman fool, and die\nOn mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes\nDo better upon them. 2475[Enter MACDUFF]\n\nMacduff. Turn, hell-hound, turn!\nMacbeth. Of all men else I have avoided thee:\nBut get thee back; my soul is too much charged\nWith blood of thine already. 2480Macduff. I have no words:\nMy voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain\nThan terms can give thee out!\n[They fight]\n\nMacbeth. Thou losest labour: 2485\nAs easy mayst thou the intrenchant air\nWith thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:\nLet fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;\nI bear a charmed life, which must not yield,\nTo one of woman born. 2490Macduff. Despair thy charm;\nAnd let the angel whom thou still hast served\nTell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb\nUntimely ripp'd.\nMacbeth. Accursed be that tongue that tells me so, 2495\nFor it hath cow'd my better part of man!\nAnd be these juggling fiends no more believed,\nThat palter with us in a double sense;\nThat keep the word of promise to our ear,\nAnd break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee. 2500Macduff. Then yield thee, coward,\nAnd live to be the show and gaze o' the time:\nWe'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,\nPainted on a pole, and underwrit,\n'Here may you see the tyrant.' 2505Macbeth. I will not yield,\nTo kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,\nAnd to be baited with the rabble's curse.\nThough Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,\nAnd thou opposed, being of no woman born, 2510\nYet I will try the last. Before my body\nI throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,\nAnd damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'\n[Exeunt, fighting. Alarums]\n[Retreat. Flourish.

Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,\nSo great a day as this is cheaply bought.\nMalcolm. Macduff is missing, and your noble son. 2520Ross. Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:\nHe only lived but till he was a man;\nThe which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd\nIn the unshrinking station where he fought,\nBut like a man he died. 2525Siward. Then he is dead?\nRoss. Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow\nMust not be measured by his worth, for then\nIt hath no end.\nSiward. Had he his hurts before? 2530Ross. Ay, on the front.\nSiward. Why then, God's soldier be he!\nHad I as many sons as I have hairs,\nI would not wish them to a fairer death:\nAnd so, his knell is knoll'd. 2535Malcolm. He's worth more sorrow,\nAnd that I'll spend for him.\nSiward. He's worth no more\nThey say he parted well, and paid his score:\nAnd so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort. 2540[Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head]\n\nMacduff. Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands\nThe usurper's cursed head: the time is free:\nI see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,\nThat speak my salutation in their minds; 2545\nWhose voices I desire aloud with mine:\nHail, King of Scotland!\nAll. Hail, King of Scotland!\n[Flourish]\n\nMalcolm. We shall not spend a large expense of time 2550\nBefore we reckon with your several loves,\nAnd make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,\nHenceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland\nIn such an honour named. What's more to do,\nWhich would be planted newly with the time, 2555\nAs calling home our exiled friends abroad\nThat fled the snares of watchful tyranny;\nProducing forth the cruel ministers\nOf this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,\nWho, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands 2560\nTook off her life; this, and what needful else\nThat calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,\nWe will perform in measure, time and place:\nSo, thanks to all at once and to each one,\nWhom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone. 2565[Flourish.

friend could\n\n[Chorus]\nEveryone's caught on to\nEverything you do\nEveryone's caught on to\n[Verse 2]\nAs if this happening wasn't enough\nI got to go and write a song just to\nRemind myself how bad it sucked\nIgnore the sun, the cover's over my head\nI wrote a message on my pillow that says\n\"Jesse, stay asleep in bed\"\nSo don't apologize (I hope you choke and die!)\nSearch your cell for something with which to hang yourself\nThey say you need to pray if you want to go to heaven\nBut they don't tell you what to say\nWhen your whole life has gone to hell\n\n[Chorus]\nEveryone's caught

yourself home\nI hope there's ice on all the roads\nAnd you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt\nAnd again when your head goes through the windshield\nIs that what you call tact?\nYou're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back\nSo let's end this call, and end this conversation\n\nAnd is that what you call a getaway?\nWell tell me what you got away with\nCause you left the frays from the ties you severed\nWhen you say best friends means friends forever\n\nIs that what you call a getaway?\nTell me what you got away with\n'Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish\nI've seen more guts

hadn't so much as turned the steering wheel\nTwo degrees in the last twenty minutes\nNor had we spoken\n[Chorus]\nAs we were, so perfect, so happy\nThey'll remember, only our smiles cause that's all

Then she was shouting. Then I was shouting\nNow pouring confessions, having no answers, or solutions\nWe barely even knew the questions\n\n[Chorus]\nAs we were, so perfect, so happy\nThey'll remember, only our smiles cause

"Angels & Airwaves", "lyrics": "A Little\u2019s Enough LyricsWhen all is said and done\nWill we still feel pain inside?\nWill the scars go away with night?\nTry to smile for the morning light\nIt's like the best dream to have\nWhere every thing is not so bad\nEvery tear is so alone\nLike God himself is coming home to say\n\nI, I can do anything\nIf you want me here\nAnd I can fix any thing\nIf you let me near\nWhere are those secrets now\nThat you're too scared to tell\nI'd whisper them all aloud\nSo you can hear yourself\nGreen trees were the first sign\nThe deepest blue, the clearest sky\nThe silence came with the brightest eyes\nAnd turned water into wine\nThe children ran to see\nThe parents stood in disbelief\nAnd those who knew braced for the ride\nThe earth itself then came alive to say\n\nI, I can do anything\nIf you want me here\nAnd I can fix anything\nIf you let me near\nWhere are those secrets now\nThat you're too scared to tell\nI whisper them all aloud\nSo you can hear yourself\n\nI'm sorry I have to say it but you look like you're sad\nYour smile is gone; I've noticed it bad\nThe cure is if you let in just a little more love\nI promise you this, a little's enough\n\nI'm sorry I have to say it but you look like you're sad\nYour smile is gone; I've noticed it bad\nThe cure is if you let in just a little more love\nI promise you this, a little's enough\nYou might also likeI'm sorry I have to say it but you look like you're sad\nYour smile is gone; I've noticed it bad\nThe cure is if you let in just a little more love\nI promise you this, a
