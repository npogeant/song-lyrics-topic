"hot rap songs chart 25th anniversary: top 100 songs lyricsto honor the 25th anniversary of billboard's hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  rap is a victorious genre. having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  so it was fitting for billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. at the time, mtv's influential ""yo! mtv raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like ice-t and n.w.a were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  while rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the billboard’s hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. from salt-n-pepa to macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100.

the shock value of my success put bolts in me all this money, is god playin' a joke on me? is it for the moment, and will he see me as job? take it from me and leave me worse than i was before? at 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall scared to go back to section 8 with my mama stressin' 30 shows a month and i still won't buy me no lexus what is an advisor? somebody that's holdin' my checks just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt? i read a case about rihanna's accountant and wondered how did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers? the type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin' drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin' i practiced runnin' from fear, guess i had some good luck at 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged how they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city what they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me what they see from me would trickle down generations in time what they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines    i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity i'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride 'cause my dna won't let me involve in the light of god i'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone i'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more i'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive fear, what happens on earth stays on earth and i can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back fear, what happens on earth stays on earth and i can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax wonderin' if i'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap damn    god damn you, god damn me god damn us, god damn we god damn us all    verse 2 says, ""you only have i known of all the families of the earth, therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities"" so until we come back to these commandments until you come back to these commandments we gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse because he said he's gonna punish us the so-called blacks, hispanics, and native american indians are the true children of israel we are the israelites, according to the bible the children of israel he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods that man chastens his son, so the lord, thy god, chasten thee so, just like you chasten your own son, he's gonna chasten you because he loves you, so that's why we get chastised that's why we're in the position that we're in until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments and do what the lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us we gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here, in today, in the united states of america i love you, family, and i pray for you god bless you shalom "
