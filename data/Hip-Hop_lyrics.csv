"hot rap songs chart 25th anniversary: top 100 songs lyricsto honor the 25th anniversary of billboard's hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  rap is a victorious genre. having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  so it was fitting for billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. at the time, mtv's influential ""yo! mtv raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like ice-t and n.w.a were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  while rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the billboard’s hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. from salt-n-pepa to macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100.

"hot rap songs chart 25th anniversary: top 100 songs lyricsto honor the 25th anniversary of billboard's hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  rap is a victorious genre. having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  so it was fitting for billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. at the time, mtv's influential ""yo! mtv raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like ice-t and n.w.a were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  while rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the billboard’s hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. from salt-n-pepa to macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100.

"hot rap songs chart 25th anniversary: top 100 songs lyricsto honor the 25th anniversary of billboard's hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  rap is a victorious genre. having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  so it was fitting for billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. at the time, mtv's influential ""yo! mtv raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like ice-t and n.w.a were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  while rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the billboard’s hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. from salt-n-pepa to macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100.

"hot rap songs chart 25th anniversary: top 100 songs lyricsto honor the 25th anniversary of billboard's hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  rap is a victorious genre. having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  so it was fitting for billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. at the time, mtv's influential ""yo! mtv raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like ice-t and n.w.a were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  while rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the billboard’s hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. from salt-n-pepa to macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100.

"   once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain there was a town where the people known as happyfolk lived their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world obscured as it was by great clouds here, they played out their peaceful lives innocent of the litany of excess and violence that was growing in the world below to live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called monkey was enough then one day, strangefolk arrived in the town they came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses but no one noticed them, they only saw shadows you see, without the truth of the eyes, the happyfolk were blind   falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes waiting for the sunset to come, people going home jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead the dance of the dead, the dance of the dead    in time, the strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain and it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty by chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest the strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things and soon they began to mine the mountain its rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world meanwhile, down in the town, the happyfolk slept restlessly their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain why was it bringing darkness into their lives? and as the strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the monkey for the first time, the happyfolk felt fearful for they knew that soon the monkey would stir from its deep sleep and then came a sound, distant at first, it grew into castrophany so immense that it could be heard far away in space there were no screams, there was no time the mountain called monkey had spoken there was only fire, and then... nothing   oh, little town in the usa, your time has come to see there's nothing you believe you want but where were you when it all came down on me? did you call me? no "

"hot rap songs chart 25th anniversary: top 100 songs lyricsto honor the 25th anniversary of billboard's hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  rap is a victorious genre. having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  so it was fitting for billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. at the time, mtv's influential ""yo! mtv raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like ice-t and n.w.a were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  while rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the billboard’s hot rap songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. from salt-n-pepa to macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100.

so won't you raise your glass, won't you? so won't you raise your glass, won't you? so won't you raise your glass, won't you? and um, he was friends with my mentor, no id. and no id told him, ""look, man, you wanna mess with kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""  no id: ""yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""     i was all, i dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer     i'm like oh shit. i was messin' with, uh, d-dot also. people were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how i got in the game. if it wasn't for that, i wouldn't be here. so you know, after they picked that ""truth"" beat i was figuring i was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. i was stayin' in chicago, i had my own apartment, i be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a pelle pelle off lay-away, get some jordans or something or get a technomarine, that's what we wore back then i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin sample i played it for hip over the phone, he's like, ""oh, yo that shit is crazy jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called the dynasty. and at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me so i went and um, i was listening to dre chronic 2001 at that time. and really i just, like bit the drums off ""xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""this can't be life.""  and that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album. i could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound you know, i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management. i really wanted to roll with hip hop 'cause i, i just needed some fresh air, you know what i'm sayin' 'cause i been there for a while. i appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. try to move up to the next level. and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jay-z and he said, ""oh you a real soulful dude.""   and he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio. you know how he do it, one take. and he said     ""tell me what you think of this."" and i heard it, and i was thinking like, man, i really wanted more like of the simple type jay-z. i ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. so he asked me, ""what you think of it?""     and i was like, ""man that shit tight,"" you know what i'm sayin', man what i'ma tell him? i was on the train, man, you know. so after that, i went back home. and man i'm, i'm just in chicago, i'm trying to do my thing. you know, i got groups. i got acts i'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. one of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. but it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. so, like i'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. and i got evicted at the same time. so i went down and tracked the beats from him, i took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a u-haul, maybe about ten days before i had to actually get out so i ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. me and my mother drove to...     ...newark, new jersey. i hadn't even seen my apartment. i remember i pulled up...     ...i unpacked all my shit. you know, we went to ikea, i bought a bed, i put the bed together myself. i loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat i made was, uh, ""heart of the city."" and beans was still working on his album at that time, so i came up there to baseline, it was beans' birthday, matter of fact, and i played like seven beats. and, you know i guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, i had did ""nothing like it"" already at that time but then jay walked in. i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on. i remember it like, like it was yesterday. and hip-hop said, ""yo play that one beat for him."" and i played ""heart of the city."" and really i made ""heart of the city,"" i really wanted to give that beat to dmx     and i played another beat, and i played another beat. and i remember that gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'ooooooooooh.' two days later i'm in baseline and i seen dame. dame didn't know who i was and i was like, ""yo what's up i'm kanye.""     ""you that kid that gave all them beats to jay? yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""     you know i ain't talkin' shit. i'm like ""oh shit."" and all this time i'm starstruck, man. i'm still thinking 'bout, you know i'm picturing these niggas on the show, the streets is watching, i'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. and they still are, you know. so, jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... i gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day i did the 'can't be life' beat on track, i remember lenny s, he had some louis vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. and hip hop was there, i think ty-ty, john meneilly, a bunch of people. i didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and i said, ""yo jay i could rap."" and i spit this rap that said, uh ""i'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. mayonnaise colored benz, i push miracle whips."" and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line. but you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. he said, ""man that was tight.""     that was it. you know, i ain't get no deal then, hehe. okay, fast forward. so, blueprint, ""h to the izzo,"" my first hit single. and i just took that proudly, built relationships with people. my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. man, i appre-- i love him for that. and at this time, you know i didn't have a deal, i had songs, and i had relationships with all these a&r's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, i'd play them some beats. ""gimme a beat that sound like jay-z."" you know, they dick riders. whatever. so i'll play them these post-blueprint beats or whatever and then i'll play my shit. i'll be like, ""yo but i rap too."" hey, i guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause i ain't have a jersey on or whatever. everybody out there listen here: i played them ""jesus walks"" and they didn't sign me. you know what happened, it was some a&r's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""naw."" like, dave lighty fucked with me, my nigga mel brought me to a bunch of labels. jessica rivera, man...     i'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up     let's just say i didn't get my deal. the nigga that was behind me, i mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? the person who actually kicked everything off was joe 3h from capitol records. he wanted to sign me really bad     dame was like, ""yo you got a deal with capitol? okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""     then one day i just went ahead and played it, i wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know cam was in the room, young guru, and dame was in the room. so i played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe i might use it. so, it's called 'wow.' ""i go to jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow i got 11 plaques on my walls right now you got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."" like the chorus went. don't bite that chorus, i might still use it. so i play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""     ""i ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""     like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. and i'm sure dame figured, 'like man. if he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and save the album, you know. so uh dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, b, b, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""     ""you gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" i told hip-hop and hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" actually, even with that, i was still about to take the deal with capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3h. that, you know, 'cause i told him i was gonna do it, and i'm a man of my word, i was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do. then, you know, i'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3h that told the heads of the capitol, and right-- the day i'm talking about, i planned out everything i was gonna do. man, i had picked out clothes, i already started booking studio sessions, i started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man i was ready to go. and they had mel call me, they said, ""yo... capitol pulled on the deal""     and, you know i told them that roc-a-fella was interested and i don't know if they thought that was just something i was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. i went up... i called g, i said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with roc-a-fella?"" so won't you raise your glass, won't you? so won't you raise your glass, won't you? so won't you raise your glass, won't you? so won't you raise your glass, won't you?

the laws of the land or the heart, what's greater? i recognize the study she was taught since birth but that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved"" the building was thinking out loud, bad angel that's when you looked at me and smiled, said, ""thank you"" the day i chose humanity over religion the family got closer, it was all forgiven i said them f-bombs, i ain't know any better mistakenly, i ain't think that you'd know any different see, i was taught words was nothing more than a sound if ever they was pronounced without any intentions the very second you challenged the shit i was kicking reminded me about a show i did out the city that time i brung a fan on stage to rap but disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me you said, ""kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction to truly understand love, switch position 'faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together but only if you let a white girl say 'nigga'"" "

"“these are the breaks” -- the history of the breakbeat lyricsthe music you hear as a kid is what shapes you.  whether your earliest musical memories are of the beatles professing that they love you yeah yeah yeah, your grammar school classmates singing along with thriller, or jay z rapping about his hard knock life, the tunes you hear in your formative years pave the way for what’s to come.  so it is with hip-hop.  the musical backbone of rap’s most influential era -- the so-called golden age of the late 1980s to early 90s -- has its roots in the childhood memories of its creators.  songs heard in parents’ dens or at dances got chopped up, dissected, and scientifically rearranged.  a few seconds of solo drums in the middle of a song would become the basis for a whole new creation.  a guitar stab, grunt, or horn riff took on new life as the canvas for an emcee or group to paint on.  and anything was fair game.  cheesy pop songs, novelties, movie soundtracks -- as long as it was funky, it made the cut.  it was all about the breaks.  at the very beginning of hip-hop culture, there was the break.  a dj named clyde campbell working parties in the bronx in the early 1970s discovered that people loved the moments in songs where everything would drop out except the drums, or occasionally the drums and bass.  but these instrumental sections were almost always short -- a few seconds or a minute.  how to keep the party going?  campbell, who was dj’ing under the name “kool herc,” invented a technique he called “the merry-go-round.”  it involved finding those key moments in each record, and going right from one to the other.  he’d start with james brown’s “give it up or turn it loose,” a favorite among b-boys to this day (it’s the one old-schoolers call “clap your hands, stomp your feet,” after brown’s exhortation at the beginning of the break).  then he’d transition into “bongo rock” from the incredible bongo band, and go right into babe ruth’s “the mexican.”  or, even better, he’d take two copies of the same record and switch back and forth, extending a single break into infinity.  the dancers loved it -- all of their favorite moments that they’d previously had to wait for, now happening one after another, in an endless wave of funky drums.  by the time rap music made it to record in 1979, the concept of extending a single breakbeat was transferred onto the new genre.  the early records featured popular songs of the era either sampled or replayed, with grooves that had once rocked the dance floor now expected to rock the pockets of record buyers. familiarity may breed contempt, but to early hip hop record makers, it also bred success.  chic’s monster hit “good times,” released that very year, formed the basis for dozens of early rap songs, including the biggest one of all, “rapper’s delight” by the sugarhill gang. cheryl lynn’s “got to be real” from the previous year was another one whose groove was used over and over.  but the breaks used at the earliest parties showed up as well.  as the genre grew and more records started being made, the tunes that folks remembered from the parties they had attended as kids ten or so years prior began showing up in their raps.  by the mid-1980s, records like the incredible bongo band’s “apache,” the honeydrippers’ “impeach the president,” or any number of james brown cuts began appearing in earnest as the backing to rap records.  and then 1986 hit, and nothing was the same.  two enigmatic figures known as “breakbeat lou” and “breakbeat lenny” put out the first volume of an anthology that would shake up the world and change the sound of rap forever.  louie flores and lenny roberts released the first of what would become 25 volumes of a series called ultimate breaks and beats.  these were wide-ranging, extremely illegal compilations that included songs favored by djs for their breaks.  the first volume contained tunes ranging from the monkees’ “mary mary” to rufus thomas’ novelty “do the funky penguin.”  but it was the third song, “amen brother” by the winstons, that would push the project over the edge.  the drum solo in that tune became so popular that it eventually got its own name -- the “‘amen’ break.”  it showed up in nwa (“straight outta compton”), salt-n-pepa (“i desire”), the ultramagnetic mcs (“critical beatdown”), and countless other dope late-80s tracks.  it also took on a second life in the 90s, as it appeared in sped-up form in nearly every drum-n-bass song of the era.  more than any individual tune, though, it was the idea of having all of the hottest breaks in one easy-to-find place that made the series take off.  until the series stopped in 1991, the tunes on ubb became the backbone of the genre.  the songs on the 25 volumes ranged from 1966 to 1984, with the vast majority unsurprisingly dating from the 70s, the same era as the parties where breakbeats first ruled.  every producer of the era, whether they copped to it or not, used breaks found somewhere on the compilations.  they defined the sound of the era.  the series ceased right around the time sampling laws tightened up, and using breaks became considerably more expensive.  the classic breaks are now far too identifiable, so current producers engage in a cat-and-mouse game of finding more and more obscure breaks, or trying to alter them enough to be unrecognizable.  luckily for the inquisitive listener of today, ubb was reissued (still illegally!) a few years ago as a set of 2 cds containing all 25 volumes on mp3, so it’s possible to find if you look hard enough.  what makes a break? “i’m ripping emcees from ‘funky drummer’ to ‘big beat’” -- ll cool j, “murdergram”  so why have some breaks been used over and over?  what makes a good break beat?  first off, from a producer’s perspective, ease of use is important.  having only the drums playing makes a breakbeat easy to sample and loop -- there are no difficult decisions on how to cut out the vocals or other instruments.  it is this simple qualification that many of rap’s most sampled breaks have in common.  in 2010, the website who sampled put together a list of the most-sampled breaks of all time.  the vast majority of them -- eight out of ten -- were from between 1969 and 1973, with just one outlier on each end of that time period.  in almost all of them, there were between two and eight bars of solo drums.  what does that mean to you as a listener?  first off, certain popular breaks have become a part of the language and meaning of rap songs.  when a contemporary song uses “apache” from the incredible bongo band (from 1973, #6 on the list), it’s used not only because it’s a dope break.  the sample’s existence is itself a reference to its popularity in early park jams, and also to the hundreds of times the beat has been sampled since 1981.  jay z and kanye west used these associations astutely on the 2011 track “that’s my bitch.”  the song foregrounded an “apache” sample, but also included an homage to public enemy and a lyrical shoutout to golden age rapper monie love.  all of these things worked in tandem to add an intended subtext of, as digital underground put it, “a tribute to the early days.”  in fact, as early as 1987, “apache” was used to signify those same early days.  a sample of the song was used on kool moe dee’s “way way back,” on which he used a self-consciously dated style to pay tribute to his roots.  likewise, busy bee used the “apache” break on his 1988 song “old school.”  immediately after the break plays, his first words are, “oh man, that’s that old school.”  without the knowledge of the break’s history, that ad-lib would fall on deaf ears, and in fact the whole concept of the song would be nonsensical. that same sample could also serve as a canvas for innovation.  kool g. rap used it for his 1989 tune “men at work,”  whose polysyllabic rhymes left a lifelong impression on a whole generation of emcees (to this day, black thought of the roots can still rap the tune perfectly word-for-word).  the tune had all the more impact for including advanced lyricism against a familiar template, where listeners were used to hearing the simplistic end-line rhymes of the sugarhill gang or the schoolyard chants of busy bee.  in truth, a solid knowledge of the soul and funk of the late 1960s and 1970s is essential to really understanding hip-hop.  being able to identify the bells on bob james’ classic “take me to the mardi gras” (1974) or the drums of kool & the gang’s “chocolate buttermilk” (1969) will add layers upon layers to your enjoyment of rap songs.  can’t stop the rock: rock & roll and other outliers “i’m the king of rock, there is none higher/sucker emcees should call me ‘sire’” -- run-dmc, “king of rock”  one of the oddities on who sampled’s list provides another important clue to unlocking the mysteries of the break beat.  number nine on the list is “the big beat,” a 1980 track by hard rocker billy squier.  the song didn’t chart, and would have been forgotten, despite its charming stop-motion-filled video , if not for rap.  its opening drum break was immediately adopted by rappers -- by 1981, it was already a staple of many artists’ live performances.  so what does this mean?  that rappers were anxiously awaiting billy squier’s first solo album?  of course not.  the break was adopted because it had open drums, was right at the beginning of the song, and sounded great.  that it was on a hard-rock record mattered not a bit.  this catholic approach to sampling has been true of hip-hop from the beginning, and continues to be so today.  popular golden age breaks came from funk and soul records, to be sure.  but they also came from jazz, hard rock, and even the monkees, the only-on-television 1960s “band” whose “mary mary” was adopted by de la soul, run-dmc, j.j. fad, and 2 live crew proteges anquette.  if something sounded good, the source didn’t matter.  this approach, of reshaping good bits no matter where they’re from, goes back very far in hip-hop’s dna.  afrika bambaataa, one of the genre’s foremost pioneers, was famous for it.  during hip-hop’s early years, he would throw parties where he would play everything -- electronic music, video game soundtracks, calypso -- with an unerring ear for what would both surprise people and keep the party moving.  his record collection, which is now preserved at cornell university, grew to over 40,000 strong, and he became known as the “master of records.”  that same adventurousness is preserved even in today’s big stars -- jay z’s sample of gonjasufi, kanye west taking from 1970s hungarian rockers omega, and more.  the godfather: james brown and the break beat “tell the truth, james brown was old/’til eric and ra came out with ‘i got soul’” -- stetsasonic, ‘talkin all that jazz’  no discussion of break beats is complete without an examination of james brown.  tracks that he either performed on or produced have been sampled well over 5,000 times, making him by far the most-sampled artist of all time.  why is that?  as with so many things in hip-hop, and in history generally, there is no one monolithic answer.  brown’s cultural impact was unparalleled during the 1960s and 70s -- remember that showing a concert of his on television in the wake of mlk’s death was pretty much the only thing that kept the city of boston from rioting.  his call to “say it loud, i’m black and i’m proud” and his self-reliant cry that “i don’t want nobody to get me nothing/open up the door, i’ll get it myself” had a huge impact on black people (and also cost him a lot of his white audience). musically, brown more or less single-handedly invented the hard-edged funk that would come to dominate the 1970s.  he took the traditions of rhythm and blues music and stripped them down to almost nothing -- a few words (often made up on the spot), a groove, and often just a single chord.  somehow, the force of his personality -- and an unerring nose for finding great musicians -- made it all work, and songs like “super bad” and “get up (i feel like being a) sex machine” created what we now think of as funk.  james’ influence extended far beyond his own tunes.  the songs he co-wrote and produced for other members of his camp became classics as well.  lyn collins (“think (about it)”) and bobby byrd (“i know you got soul”) used brown’s band the j.b.’s to produce great records in the vein of the master.  and the j.b.’s themselves released a ton of instrumentals in the 1970s that stand alongside brown’s greatest work.  even former members of brown’s band got in on the act.  the sibling team of william “bootsy” collins on bass and phelps “catfish” collins on guitar, who played with brown briefly in 1970-1, became key members of the legendary parliament-funkadelic collective after leaving the group.  what does this all have to do with breaks?  first off, james’ early funk songs were repetitive grooves.  while played straight through by the musicians, their circular nature connects them to the four- and eight-bar loops of early rap.  also, the extended length of many of the tunes meant that there were lots of moments without vocals for burgeoning producers to sample.  and then there were the drum breaks.  “funky drummer,” number two on who sampled’s list, is a prime example.  the song itself is a seven-minute mellow bit of funk that consists almost entirely of a one-bar vamp.  brown emotes and plays some organ on top of the groove.  then, almost five minutes in, brown starts giving the band instructions for an upcoming drum break.   “you don’t have to do no soloing, brother.  just keep what you got!” he tells drummer clyde stubblefield.  and 45 seconds later, stubblefield does just that.  everyone drops out, and perhaps the most famous eight bars in the history of funk begins.  the beat -- a barrage of ghost notes, hi-hat openings and closings, and a tricky syncopated kick drum pattern -- would echo down through the decades.  starting in the mid-1980s, the beat became a staple in hip-hop.  other brown songs would soon follow, creating renewed interest in the master’s work.  while all eras of his career would be fair game for samplers, his “hard funk” period that began with 1967’s “cold sweat” and continued through 1976 makes up the vast majority of the sampled tunes.  the funk and soul of the late 1960s and 1970s, brown especially, is the dna of hip-hop.  it worked its way into the genre’s sound, its emcees rhythms, and even its lyrical preoccupations.  from biggie’s “funk flow to make your drawers drop slow” to “redman on the funk train,” the sound, feel, attitude, and cool of the funk pioneers has been a guiding light in the rap world.  in addition to brown, his proteges in the parliament-funkadelic collective had a huge influence on the sound of west coast rap in particular.  dr. dre’s breakthrough 1992 solo album the chronic, a record that came to define the so-called “g-funk” sound, featured ten different samples from either parliament, funkadelic, or the collective’s leader george clinton, where no other artist was sampled more than once.  kool & the gang, before having smash success with crossover hits like “hollywood swingin’,” released funky instrumental tracks that would later be raided by producers.  their 1969 debut record would be used by pioneers like eric b and rakim, stetsasonic, x-clan, nwa, special ed, a tribe called quest, and more.  while breakbeats were originally used to keep the party going, they came to be much more than that.  they were a way for producers to use the music that was most familiar to them in order to create something exciting and new.  and later, they began to signify themselves -- that is, to represent all of the other times that particular break has been used.  that, ultimately, is the magic of breaks, and their ever-shifting meaning over time is as hip-hop as anything else about them.
