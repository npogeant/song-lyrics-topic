heard\nI wish I had a better voice that sang some better words\nI wish I found some chords in an order that is new\nI wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang\nI was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink\nBut now I'm insecure, and I care what people think\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMy name's Blurryface and I care what you think\nMy name's Blurryface and I care what you think\n[Chorus]\nWish we could turn back time to the good old days\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out\n(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)\nWhen our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out\nWe're stressed out\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young\nHow come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?\nI'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it\nTry to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one\nIt'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose\nSame clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam\nBut it would remind us of when nothing really mattered\nOut of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMy-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think\nMy name's Blurryface and I care what you think\n\n[Chorus]\nWish we could turn back time to the good old days\nWhen our

Monkey\u2019s Head Lyrics[Verse 1: Dennis Hopper]\nOnce upon a time at the foot of a great mountain\nThere was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived\nTheir very existence a mystery to the rest of the world\nObscured as it was by great clouds\nHere, they played out their peaceful lives\nInnocent of the litany of excess and violence\nThat was growing in the world below\nTo live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough\nThen one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town\nThey came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses\nBut no one noticed them, they only saw shadows\nYou see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind\n[Interlude: 2D]\nFalling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes\nWaiting for the sunset to come, people going home\nJump out from behind them and shoot them in the head\nNow everybody dancing, the dance of the dead\nThe dance of the dead, the dance of the dead\n\n[Verse 2: Dennis Hopper]\nIn time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain\nAnd it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty\nBy chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest\nThe Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things\nAnd soon they began to mine the mountain\nIts rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world\nMeanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly\nTheir dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls\nEvery day, people would wake and stare at the mountain\nWhy was it bringing darkness into their lives?\nAnd as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear\nBringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey\nFor the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful\nFor they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep\nAnd then came a sound, distant at first, it grew into castrophany\nSo immense that it could be heard far away in space\nThere were no screams, there was no time\nThe mountain called Monkey had spoken\nThere was only fire, and then... nothing\nSee Gorillaz LiveGet

everything sound worse\nCan't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing\nAnd maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed\nWhich is ironic because when I wasn't honest\nI was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)\nNow we're estranged\n[Chorus]\nThings I once enjoyed\nJust keep me employed now\nThings I'm longing for\nSomeday, I'll be bored of\nIt's so weird\nThat we care so much until we don't\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders\nBut I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong\nI'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor\nTo keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure\n'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise\nWould depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)\n(Wasn't my
