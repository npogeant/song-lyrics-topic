He is considered to have committed, invoking droit d\u2019oreiller, simple infidelities with Felicia, a virgin, and to be practising for unnatural coits with Eugenius and Jere-mias, two or three philadelphians. Honophrius, Felicia, Eugenius and Jeremias are consanguineous to the lowest degree. Anita the wife of Honophrius, has been told by her tirewoman, For-tissa, that Honuphrius has blasphemously confessed under volun \u2014 tary chastisement that he has instructed his slave, Mauritius, to ur;, e Magravius, a commercial, emulous of Honuphrius, to solicit the chastity of Anita. Anita is informed by some illegitimate children of Fortissa with Mauritius (the supposition is Ware\u2019s) that Gillia, the schismatical wife of Magravius, is visited clandes-tinely by Barnabas, the advocate of Honuphrius, an immoral person who has been corrupted by Jeremias. Gillia, (a cooler blend, D\u2019Alton insists) ex equo with Poppea, Arancita, Clara, Marinuzza, Indra and Iodina, has been tenderly debauched (in Halliday\u2019s view), by Honuphrius, and Magravius knows from spies that Anita has formerly committed double sacrilege with Michael, vulgo Cerularius, a perpetual curate, who wishes to seduce Eugenius. Magravius threatens to have Anita molested by Sulla, an orthodox savage (and leader of a band of twelve mercenaries, the Sullivani), who desires to procure Felicia for Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and Macdugalius, four excavators, if she will not yield to him and also deceive Honuphrius by ren-dering conjugal duty when demanded. Anita who claims to have discovered incestuous temptations from Jeremias and Eugenius would yield to the lewdness of Honuphrius to appease the savagery of Sulla and the mercernariness of the twelve Sullivani, and (as Gilbert at first suggested), to save the virginity of Felicia for Magravius when converted by Michael after the death of Gillia, but she fears that, by allowing his marital rights she may cause reprehensible conduct between Eugenius and Jeremias. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, dispen-ses her from yielding to Honuphrius who pretends publicly to possess his conjunct in thirtynine several manners (turpiter! affirm ex cathedris Gerontes Cambronses) for camal hygiene whenever he has rendered himself impotent to consummate by subdolence. Anita is disturbed but Michael comminates that he will reserve her case tomorrow for the ordinary Guglielmus even if she should practise a pious fraud during affrication which, from experience, she knows (according to Wadding), to be leading to nullity. Fortissa, however, is encouraged by Gregorius, Leo, Viteilius, and Magdugalius, reunitedly, to warn Anita by describing the strong chastisements of Honuphrius and the depravities (turpissimas!) of Canicula, the deceased wife of Mauritius, with Sulla, the simoniac, who is abnegand and repents. Has he hegemony and shall she submit?\n\nTranslate a lax, you breed a bradaun. In the goods of Cape and Chattertone, deceased.\n\nThis, lay readers and gentilemen, is perhaps the commonest of all cases arising out of umbrella history in connection with the wood industries in our courts of litigation. D\u2019Oyly Owens holds (though Finn Magnusson of himself holds also) that so long as there is a joint deposit account in the two names a mutual obligation is posited. Owens cites Brerfuchs and Warren, a foreign firm, since disseized, registered as Tangos, Limited, for the sale of certain proprietary articles. The action which was at the instance of the trustee of the heathen church emergency fund, suing by its trustee, a resigned civil servant, for the pay-ment of tithes due was heard by Judge Doyle and also by a com \u2014 mon jury. No question arose as to the debt for which vouchers spoke volumes. The defence alleged that payment had been made effective. The fund trustee, one Jucundus Fecundus Xero Pecun-dus Coppercheap, counterclaimed that payment was invalid having been tendered to creditor under cover of a crossed cheque, signed in the ordinary course, in the name of Wieldhelm, Hurls Cross, voucher copy provided, and drawn by the senior partner only by whom the lodgment of the species had been effected but in their joint names. The bank particularised, the national misery (now almost entirely in the hands of the four chief bondholders for value in Tangos), declined to pay the draft, though there were ample reserves to meet the liability, whereupon the trusty Coppercheap negociated it for and on behalf of the fund of the thing to a client of his, a notary, from whom, on consideration, he received in exchange legal relief as between trusthee and bethrust, with thanks. Since then the cheque, a good washable pink, em-bossed D you D No 11 hundred and thirty 2, good for the figure and face, had been circulating in the country for over thirtynine years among holders of Pango stock, a rival concern, though not one demonetised farthing had ever spun or fluctuated across the counter in the semblance of hard coin or liquid cash. The jury (a sour dozen of stout fellows all of whom were curiously named after doyles) naturally disagreed jointly and severally, and the belligerent judge, disagreeing with the allied jurors\u2019 disagree-ment, went outside his jurisfiction altogether and ordered a gar \u2014 nishee attachment to the neutral firm. No mandamus could lo \u2014 cate the depleted whilom Breyfawkes as he had entered into an ancient moratorium, dating back to the times of the early barters, and only the junior partner Barren could be found, who entered an appearance and turned up, upon a notice of motion and after service of the motion by interlocutory injunction, among the male jurors to be an absolete turfwoman, originally from the proletarian class, with still a good title to her sexname of Ann Doyle, 2 Coppinger\u2019s Cottages, the Doyle\u2019s country. Doyle (Ann), add woman in, having regretfully left the juryboxers, protested cheerfully on the stand in a long jurymiad in re corset checks, delivered in doy-lish, that she had often, in supply to brusk demands rising almost to bollion point, discounted Mr Brakeforth\u2019s first of all in ex-change at nine months from date without issue and, to be strictly literal, unbottled in corrubberation a current account of how she had been made at sight for services rendered the payee-drawee of unwashable blank assignations, sometimes pinkwilliams (laughter) but more often of the cr\u0160me-de-citron, vair \u201amail paon-coque or marshmallow series, which she, as bearer, used to en \u2014 dorse, adhesively, to her various payers-drawers who in most cases were identified by the timber papers as wellknown tetigists of the city and suburban.

"TranslationsPolskiPortugu\u00easNederlandsFire Coming Out of the Monkey\u2019s Head Lyrics[Verse 1: Dennis Hopper]\nOnce upon a time at the foot of a great mountain\nThere was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived\nTheir very existence a mystery to the rest of the world\nObscured as it was by great clouds\nHere, they played out their peaceful lives\nInnocent of the litany of excess and violence\nThat was growing in the world below\nTo live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough\nThen one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town\nThey came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses\nBut no one noticed them, they only saw shadows\nYou see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind\n[Interlude: 2D]\nFalling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes\nWaiting for the sunset to come, people going home\nJump out from behind them and shoot them in the head\nNow everybody dancing, the dance of the dead\nThe dance of the dead, the dance of the dead\n\n[Verse 2: Dennis Hopper]\nIn time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain\nAnd it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty\nBy chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest\nThe Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things\nAnd soon they began to mine the mountain\nIts rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world\nMeanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly\nTheir dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls\nEvery day, people would wake and stare at the mountain\nWhy was it bringing darkness into their lives?\nAnd as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear\nBringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey\nFor the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful\nFor they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep\nAnd then came a sound, distant at first, it grew into castrophany\nSo immense that it could be heard far away in space\nThere were no screams, there was no time\nThe mountain called Monkey had spoken\nThere was only fire, and then... nothing\nSee Gorillaz LiveGet tickets as low as $94You might also like[Outro: 2D]\nOh, little town in the USA, your time has come to see\nThere's nothing you believe you want\nBut where were

Miserable Now - 2011 Remaster", "artist": "The Smiths", "lyrics": "Every Iron Maiden Song Ranked From Worst to Best LyricsIn the 40-plus years since their 1975 formation, Iron Maiden have served as the embodiment\u2005of\u2005all that defines\u2005heavy metal. In this fan-validated genre,\u2005they\u2019ve done everything on their own terms, even back in their earliest days where they refused to conform to punk standards in order to secure a record deal. The unwavering Steve Harris had a vision, compromising nothing (except maybe for the tempo of \u201cFlight of Icarus\u201d) as Iron Maiden\u2019s timeless songs and mythical stage productions won fans over worldwide with little help from the mainstream so many of their peers thrived on.\n\nBoasting, in our estimation, the strongest catalog in metal, ranking every song from Eddie and the boys was a daunting but welcome challenge. Each song a storybook of sorts, Iron Maiden have taken their listeners through the war-torn skies where fighter pilots clashed in World War II, ushered the condemned on the lonely walk to the gallows, traveled back to ancient Egypt where men became gods (not a far cry from their immortal heavy metal status) and through other historic moments and realms of fantastic escape through literature and film.\n\nEven in the 21st century, Iron Maiden\u2019s output has contested their stunning seven album streak in the \u201880s. Not content to resign themselves to being a greatest hits band, they\u2019ve alternated album tours with nods to specific eras in their past, demonstrating the staying power of their entire catalog, even resurrecting two classics from the divisive Blaze Bayley era on their 2018 \u201cLegacy of the Beast\u201d tour.\n\nNo other band has maintained such a level of dominance for so long, a notion that becomes soberingly evident as you scroll through our ranking of Iron Maiden\u2019s songs below, with dozens of fan-favorites appearing well beyond the 75 mark.\n\nUp the irons today, tomorrow and for all eternity \u2014 even if eternity should fail.\n\nEvery Iron Maiden Song Ranked From Worst to Best\nScroll through the gallery to see how we ranked every song Iron Maiden have written.\n\n165. \"The Angel and the Gambler\" - 'Virtual XI' (1998)\nThe Blaze Bayley era of Iron Maiden coincided with a massive downturn in the acceptance of \u201880s heavy metal. The band was clearly struggling, and \u201cThe Angel and the Gambler\u201d is the biggest miss of their career from the chintzy \u201cBaba O\u2019Reilly\u201d ripoff to the cartoon soundboard orchestration to the painstakingly repetitive chorus that goes on for three minutes more than it should have. Now, onto better things...\n\n164. \"Weekend Warrior\" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)\nIf there\u2019s one thing we didn\u2019t want Iron Maiden to write a song about, it was football (they call it \u201cfootball,\u201d we call it \u201csoccer\u201d). Okay, football hooliganism in this case, but \u201cWeekend Warrior\u201d was still a lyrical square peg in a heavy metal world full of dragon and/or spaceship-shaped holes. Just so you know. (DL)\n\n163. \"I Live My Way\" - 'The X Factor' (1995)\nOnly available on the 12-inch vinyl version of the \u201cMan On The Edge\u201d single, \u201cI Live My Way\u201d probably wins an award for being one of the most obscure Maiden songs. Sadly, it\u2019s not one of the most memorable. (DL)\n\n162. \"Burning Ambition\" - \"Running Free\" Single (1980)\nEasily the worst song Maiden recorded with Paul Di\u2019Anno, it doesn\u2019t fit in with the rest of the output from that era. Had they continued down this road, they\u2019d be little more than a mainstream leaning hard rock band. It makes an interesting B-side to \u201cRunning Free,\u201d but we\u2019re glad it didn\u2019t make the cut for the band\u2019s flawless self-titled debut. (BI)\n\n161. \"Nodding Donkey Blues\" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)\nIron Maiden never were a blues band but they definitely know how to have fun with the genre. This B-side to \u201cBe Quick Or Be Dead\u201d is a prime example. Let\u2019s just say that this song is kind of their tongue-in-cheek version of \u201cWhole Lotta Rosie.\u201d Bonus: a boogie-woogie piano solo, during which Bruce deadpans \u201cThere should be some kind of guitar solo here\u2026\u201d (BI)\n\n160. \"Quest for Fire\" - 'Piece of Mind' (1983)\nWelcome to the worst Iron Maiden song of the \u201880s. Films have provided Maiden with rich lyrical inspiration, but on \u201cQuest for Fire,\u201d they tread in the shallowest of waters, nicking the 1981 film of the same name (which was adapted from the 1911 book of the same name) for a source material. It\u2019s a ham-fisted attempt to write about early man\u2019s discovery of fire and the subsequent pursuit for those precious embers, but it comes across as a drunken studio romp rife with hokey riffing and bottom-feeding lyrics. For all the classics Harris gave us, he\u2019s earned at least one pass. He\u2019s lucky \u201cThe Trooper\u201d is also on \u2018Piece of Mind.\u2019 (JD)\n\n159. \"Como Estais Amigos\" - 'Virtual XI' (1998)\nIt turned out to be Blaze Bayley\u2019s swan song, but \u201cComo Estasis Amigos\u201d was one of the few songs on \u2018Virtual XI\u2019 that really put his voice to good use. Unfortunately, the album\u2019s thin sonics and fatal lack of urgency made this a less emotional finale than it could\u2019ve been. (DL)\n\n158. \"Black Bart Blues\" - \"Can I Play With Madness\" Single (1988)\nThe B-side to \u201cCan I Play With Madness?\u201d could have been called \u201cOK, Now I\u2019m Playing With Madness!\u201d It\u2019s easy to imagine that, after working on the heavy and proggy \u2018Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son,\u2019 Maiden wanted to have some light-hearted fun. This Van Halen-like jam definitely is fun, and also pretty bonkers: the lyrics are about \u201cBlack Bart,\u201d allegedly a suit of armor that the band picked up on their adventures. Somehow Bart meets a woman with a mysterious background: \u201cDon't know where she's been/Maybe she's an acrobat/Spends her evenings dancing on a pole.\u201d If that\u2019s not weird enough, Bruce Dickinson argues with a high pitched character during the song, and just when you think that the song is finished, Nicko McBrain takes over and screws around for about two more minutes. It\u2019s too weird to describe, but you can find the track on YouTube and check it out. (BI)\n\n157. \"The Apparition\" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)\nOne of those songs that probably seemed like a good idea at the time, \u201cThe Apparition\u201d brought a staccato funk vibe to the Maiden table. Something like that, anyway. The instrumental and solo sections are great, but the verses verge on a confused mess. (DL)\n156. \"Virus\" - 'Best of the Beast' (1996)\nAs if \u2018The X-Factor\u2019 wasn\u2019t grim and harrowing enough, the stand-alone single that followed it took Maiden into even more hopeless, anguished territory. Blaze Bayley does his best to keep the whole thing cracking along, but it\u2019s essentially a monochrome dirge with no real tune. (DL)\n\n155. \"No Prayer for the Dying\" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)\nEasily the weakest album the band have made with Bruce on board, \u2018No Prayer For The Dying\u2019 was sold to fans as a \u2018back-to-basics\u2019 affair. The reality was that much of it sounded unimaginative and half-baked. The title track, while eminently likable, is almost certainly not on your Maiden Spotify playlist. (DL)\n\n154. \"Don't Look to the Eyes of a Stranger\" - 'Virtual XI' (1998)\nNeedlessly drawn out and powered by some rather pedestrian riffs that surely wouldn\u2019t have made the grade on earlier Maiden albums, \u201cDon\u2019t Look To The Eyes Of A Stranger\u201d stumbles on its own complexity and has an ending that doesn\u2019t work. (DL)\n\n153. \"Roll Over Vic Vella\" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)\nA semi-cover of Chuck Berry\u2019s \u201cRoll Over Beethoven\u201d with new lyrics about the band\u2019s roadie, Vic Vella. Chuck Berry covers, unsurprisingly, aren\u2019t Iron Maiden\u2019s strong suit. On the other hand, it\u2019s better than Judas Priest\u2019s \u201cJohnny B. Goode.\u201d (BI)\n\n152. \"Hooks in You\" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)\nAdrian Smith has written so many songs that are vastly better than \u201cHooks In You\u201d that it seems a bit pointless to mention it at all. But we must, if only to celebrate the phrase \u201cNew ideas for the d\u00e9cor tonight!\u201d Never thought we\u2019d hear Bruce sing that, to be fair. (DL)\n\n151. \"Wasting Love\" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)\nA well-intended but unsatisfying ballad on \u2018Fear Of The Dark,\u2019 an album that had plenty of much more exciting moments, \u201cWasting Love\u201d is both an overlong showcase for Bruce Dickinson\u2019s voice and a good excuse to go and make some tea. (DL)\n\n150. \"The Educated Fool\" - 'Virtual XI' (1998)\nStymied by its anaemic production and a palpable lack of killer material, \u2018Virtual XI\u2019 isn\u2019t without its merits and \u201cThe Educated Fool\u201d boasts at least one great melody to justify its inclusion. Compared to \u201cThe Clansman,\u201d however, it\u2019s not up to scratch. (DL)\n\n149. \"Tears of a Clown\" - 'The Book of Souls (2015)\nBriefly played during Maiden\u2019s \u2018Book Of Souls\u2019 live campaign, this self-explanatory salute to troubled funny men is yet another great example of Adrian Smith\u2019s subtly subversive contributions to the Maiden sound. But a Smokey Robinson cover would have been much funnier, if we\u2019re honest. (DL)\n\n148. \"El Dorado\" - 'The Final Frontier' (2010)\nIt starts with what sounds like an ending: a typically contrary Maiden move, let\u2019s face it. \u201cEl Dorado\u201d is not one of the band\u2019s greatest singles, but it did win a Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 2011. So hooray for that. (DL)\n147. \"Out of the Shadows\" - 'A Matter of Life and Death' (2006)\nBrimming with moments of unashamed prog abandon, this oddity gave \u2018A Matter Of Life And Death\u2019 one of its rare moments of emotional respite, albeit mainly because Steve Harris\u2019 bass-line is so goddamn hypnotic. (DL)\n\n146. \"Fortunes of War\" - 'The X Factor' (1995)\nAfter a relatively exciting opening triumvirate of new songs, \u2018The X-Factor\u2019 slows down for \u201cFortunes Of War\u201d and loses practically all of its momentum. The lyrics are brooding and full of quiet rage, but the music beneath them is not among Maiden\u2019s finest five minutes. (DL)\n\n145. \"The Aftermath\" - 'The X Factor' (1995)\nThe lumbering nadir of \u2018The X-Factor,\u2019 \u201cThe Aftermath\u201d arrives after \u201cFortunes Of War\u201d and \u201cLook For The Truth\u201d have already drained your lifesblood. The longest, darkest and least memorable of the three, it does at least hammer home the point that Steve Harris was in a terrible mood. (DL)\n\n144. \"Mother Russia\" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)\nBy 1990, Maiden fans were used to the band\u2019s albums containing a grandiose epic or two. But after the glories of \u201cRime Of The Ancient Mariner\u201d and \u201cSeventh Son Of A Seventh Son,\u201d \u201cMother Russia\u201d was a slight anti-climax. You can bet Dimmu Borgir liked it, though. (DL)\n\n143. \"Childhood's End\" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)\nThere are more than a few unsung gems lurking on Maiden\u2019s less celebrated albums, and the skewed goth-prog splendour of \u201cChildhood\u2019s End\u201d is firmly among them. By no means a classic, it does give \u2018Fear Of The Dark\u2019 a rare moment of forward-thinking oomph. (DL)\n\n142. \"Look for the Truth\" - 'The X Factor' (1995)\nThe big downfall of \u2018The X-Factor\u2019 is the prolonged period of slow, miserable songs halfway through. \u201cLook For The Truth\u201d is particularly weak, with predictable chord changes serving only to hammer home the lack of a genuinely punchy melody. (DL)\n\n141. \"Listen With Nicko, Part XI\" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)\nNicko McBrain: he\u2019s just ahead of his time. He was a podcaster decades before podcasts (or even iPods). On 1990\u2019s \u2018The First Ten Years\u2019 box set, he recorded a bunch of monologues as bonus tracks. They were so popular (or, at least, someone told Nicko that they were), that he recorded another one as a bonus track for \u2018No Prayer For The Dying.\u2019 Note to Nicko: the world needs to know about your comedic brilliance. Seriously, please start a podcast. (BI)\n\n140. \"Age of Innocence\" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)\n\"Age of Innocence\" finds Iron Maiden returning to the well of film and literature to vent their frustrations with the world and its rocky systems of government. The vitriol here is fairly shallow though, echoing the same tired sentiments of countless citizens of the world and while, yes, its certainly angsty with some aggressive riffing, it's not very inspired. (JD)\n\n139. \"The Man Who Would Be King\" - 'The Final Frontier' (2010)\nWith Dave Murray\u2019s ultra-melodic instincts all over it, the penultimate epic from \u2018The Final Frontier\u2019 veers from swooshing keys and a disembodied Bruce floating in the haze to long stretches of full-on Maiden bombast, replete with what sound like post-In Flames harmonies. That\u2019s a joke for our older readers, by the way. (DL)\n\n138. \"For the Greater Good of God\" - 'A Matter of Life and Death' (2006)\nSteve Harris loves a good epic. He also loves a heart-wrenching war story. This nine-minute sprawl from \u2018A Matter Of Life And Death\u2019 combines the two to chilling and faintly morose effect. Resurrected for the current \u201cLegacy Of The Beast\u201d tour, it\u2019s not a party banger. (DL)\n\n137. \"2 A.M.\" - 'The X Factor' (1995)\nOne slow, sad song too many for most fans, when they reached the end of Maiden\u2019s most emotionally gruelling album, \u201c2 A.M.\u201d works best in isolation. A pretty but spiky ballad, beautifully sung by Blaze, it\u2019s a straightforward outpouring of melancholy and angst. (DL)\n\n136. \"Mission From 'Arry\" - \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" Single (1984)\nAlthough Bruce Dickinson doesn\u2019t appear on this recording, we have him to thank for it. \u201cMission From \u2018Arry\u201d is a recording of a pretty intense (but funny) argument between Steve Harris (a.k.a. \u201c\u2018Arry\u201d) and Nicko McBrain that Bruce was kind enough to record for the rest of us; it reached the public as a b-side to \u201c2 Minutes To Midnight.\u201d Apparently, during a gig, Steve Harris\u2019 bass gear broke down, and he sent a roadie to tell McBrain to extend his drum solo while they were fixing it. The moral of the story is: don\u2019t interrupt a drummer DURING the solo. But if you do, be sure to record the ensuing brawl. (BI)\n\n135. \"The Pilgrim\" - 'A Matter of Life and Death' (2006)\nArguably the runt of the \u2018A Matter Of Life And Death\u2019 litter, \u201cThe Pilgrim\u201d is an essential part of the album but not a song you\u2019re likely to whistle in the shower. Fast-paced and edgy, it\u2019s every bit as progressive as the songs around it, but lacks one truly heart-stopping moment. (DL)\n\n134. \"Dance of Death\" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)\nLauded and loathed in equal measure for being a little bit too close to Spinal Tap\u2019s \u201cStonehenge\u201d routine for comfort, \u201cDance Of Death\u201d wears its prog rock influences with pride and really doesn\u2019t care if you like songs about wizards or not. So there. (DL)\n\n133. \"De\u0301ja\u0300 Vu\" - 'Somewhere in Time' (1986)\nOne of the fastest tracks on \u2018Somewhere In Time,\u2019 \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u201d is much loved by Maiden fans of a certain age, partly because it\u2019s a rare Dave Murray/Steve Harris co-write (we nerds love this shit) and partly because the twin-lead moments are spectacular. The lyrics are a bit daft, however. (DL)\n\n132. \"Chains of Misery\" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)\nUncomfortably close to the kind of one-dimensional metal that Maiden had always avoided, \u201cChains Of Misery\u201d is unusual for the band\u2019s decision to use gang vocals in the chorus. Worth a try, perhaps, but it doesn\u2019t really work. This is more filler than killer. (DL)\n\n131. \"Judgement of Heaven\" - 'The X Factor' (1995)\nA song that just about saves \u2018The X-Factor\u2019 from falling asleep at the wheel, \u201cJudgement Of Heaven\u201d has a killer chorus that is sadly not quite matched by the rest of the tune. A great vocal from Blaze Bayley, however, and a wistfully quasi-spiritual lyric thrown in for free. (DL)\n\n130. \"When the Rivers Runs Deep\" - 'The Book of Souls (2015)\nA strong candidate for the weakest track on \u2018The Book Of Souls,\u2019 \u201cWhen The River Runs Deep\u201d just about earns its place on Maiden\u2019s latest album thanks to a brilliantly off-the-wall Adrian Smith solo four minutes in. (DL)\n\n129. \"Sheriff of Huddersfield\" - 'Somewhere in Time' (1986)\nMaiden\u2019s best B-sides have generally been spirited covers or, very occasionally, the sound of grown men dicking about. A tribute to manager Rod Smallwood that pulls no punches about the great man\u2019s reported miserliness, it\u2019s actually a half-decent song (with stupid lyrics). (DL)\n\n128. \"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" - 'A Matter of Life and Death' (2006)\nThe first song to be released from \u2018A Matter Of Life And Death,\u2019 this dark, heavy and seemingly unlikely single arrived tied to some vague promotional scheme involving a the mysterious identity of the song\u2019s titular hero. No, we don\u2019t know how that worked out either. (DL)\n\n127. \"Journeyman\" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)\nMaiden\u2019s much-vaunted leap into acoustic territory was one of Dance Of Death\u2019s most memorable moments. With a vague hint of Jethro Tull and a large dollop of world-weary resignation, \u201cJourneyman\u201d worked pretty well live, too. (DL)\n\n126. \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" - 'Somewhere in Time' (1986)\nAnother Steve Harris composition reportedly inspired by his voracious movie-watching habits, this rapacious epic may pale beside the better songs on \u2018Somewhere In Time,\u2019 but it\u2019s still a riot of spiralling leads and lithe, rhythmic wallop. (DL)\n\n125. \"Lord of the Flies\" - 'The X Factor' (1995)\nIt\u2019s never been that hard to keep track of Steve Harris\u2019 reading and watching habits. This song\u2019s thematic debt to William Golding\u2019s legendary novel was fully in keeping with the dark aesthetic of \u2018The X-Factor,\u2019 but Maiden have seldom sounded less chirpy. (DL)\n\n124. \"Holy Smoke\" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)\nBelatedly addressing the TV preacher phenomenon with no great subtlety, \u201cHoly Smoke\u201d is not one of Maiden\u2019s best singles, but it is notable for boasting (a) a rare sighting of a curse word in a Maiden song (Bruce says \u2018shit!\u2019) and (b) one of the best/worst videos ever made. (DL)\n\n123. \"Satellite 15... The Final Frontier\" - 'The Final Frontier' (2010)\nOpinion was split on the values of \u201cSatellite 15,\u201d a noisy futuristic intro with jarring programmed drums, and it still sounds like what it was (an Adrian Smith demo), but \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d is a nuts-out, sky-punching Maiden anthem, so it\u2019s not all bad news. (DL)\n\n122. \"Justice of the Peace\" - 'The X Factor' (1995)\nA Murray/Harris co-write confined to the b-side on the second of two CD single versions of \u201cMan On The Edge\u201d (it was a confusing time to be alive, folks), this fair-to-middling rabble-rouser is arguably more exciting than a good third of \u2018The X-Factor.\u2019 Just saying. (DL)\n\n121. \"Fates Warning\" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)\nLiterally no one\u2019s favourite Maiden song, \u201cFates Warning\u201d was probably not named after the iconic progressive metal band, not least because it lacks a single interesting musical idea. A major low point in the first Bruce era, you just can\u2019t whistle it in the shower, can you? (DL)\n\n120. \"The Mercenary\" - 'Brave New World' (2000)\nOn an album full of joyful demonstrations of their renewed prowess, Iron Maiden could probably have left \u201cThe Mercenary\u201d off \u2018Brave New World,\u2019 simply because it\u2019s the kind of song you suspect they can write in their collective sleep. (DL)\n\n119. \"The Unbeliever\" - 'The X Factor' (1995)\nTucked at the back-end of somewhat overlong \u2018The X-Factor,\u2019 \u201cThe Unbeliever\u201d may be a song that many fans never quite got round to listening to. But they should: it\u2019s a scowling, nihilistic affair with some neat proggy touches. (DL)\n\n118. \"Death or Glory\" - 'The Book of Souls (2015)\nCustom built for live performance, \u201cDeath Or Glory\u201d saw Adrian Smith reasserting himself as master of brevity and bombast. Bruce Dickinson\u2019s instruction to \u201cclimb like a monkey\u201d never made a great deal of sense, but this is heavy metal, not chemistry. (DL)\n\n117. \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)\nPerhaps against the odds, this rambling epic has made occasional visits to Maiden\u2019s set lists over the last 25 years. It\u2019s a tense and turbulent war story, the horrors of the Gulf War brought eloquently to life by Steve Harris. (DL)\n\n116. \"Invaders\" - 'The Number of the Beast' (1982)\nFew would argue that \u201cInvaders\u201d is a classic like \u201cRun To The Hills\u201d or \u201cThe Number Of The Beast,\u201d but it\u2019s hard to imagine Maiden\u2019s triumphant 1982 breakthrough album without this mad-eyed, riff-driven ambush as its starting point.\n\n115. \"New Frontier\" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)\nThree decades after joining Iron Maiden, Nicko McBrain earned his first writing credit on the \u2018Frankenstein\u2019-inspired \u201cNew Frontier.\u201d The track\u2019s kicking energy and single-leaning approach is the last bit of joy to be found as darkness looms large over the ensuing four tracks that close out the \u2018Dance of Death\u2019 record. Despite its charm, it doesn\u2019t have as much staying power on the dynamic recording, but it\u2019s always a fun one when it pops up either on shuffle or when cruising through \u2018Dance of Death.\u2019 (JD)\n\n114. \"Man on the Edge\" - 'The X Factor' (1995)\nThe first Blaze Bayley-fronted Maiden song to be released, \u201cMan On The Edge\u201d came as a great relief to many diehards. Spiky and aggressive, its re-imagining of Michael Douglas\u2019 peerless film \u2018Falling Down\u2019 gave \u2018The X-Factor\u2019 some much needed energy. (DL)\n\n113. \"From Here to Eternity\" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)\nA disappointingly prosaic rock and roller from the intermittently great \u2018Fear Of The Dark,\u2019 this mostly unloved single always seemed a bit unimaginative, especially since only four years had passed since \u2018Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son.\u2019 (DL)\n\n112. \"These Colours Don't Run\" - 'A Matter of Life and Death' (2006)\nSharon Osbourne may deserve a songwriting credit on \u201cThese Colours Don\u2019t Run,\u201d since the track wouldn\u2019t exist without her egging of Iron Maiden at Ozzfest 2005. Named after the sentiment Bruce Dickinson aired onstage, \u201cThese Colours Don\u2019t Run\u201d is another solid wartime effort from Maiden worthy of its seven minute run time. (GH)\n\n111. \"The Edge of Darkness\" - 'The X Factor' (1995)\nOne of several moody, predominantly slow-paced epics that Steve Harris wrote to showcase Blaze Bayley\u2019s powerful, gritty voice, this was a highlight of the underrated second half of \u2018The X-Factor,\u2019 albeit not one you\u2019d necessarily play at a party. (DL)\n\n110. \"Wildest Dreams\" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)\nMaiden went through a period where every new album seemed to be preceded by a short, snappy three-to-four-minute sing-along single. \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d isn\u2019t one of the band\u2019s best but it served its purpose perfectly well as a set opener on the \u2018Dance Of Death\u2019 tour. (DL)\n\n109. \"Invasion\" - 'The Soundhouse Tapes' (1979)\nBlustery and na\u00efve it may be, but \u201cInvasion\u201d is an exciting snapshot of early Maiden, when harnessing the energy of punk at least seemed to be part of the band\u2019s modus operandi. Revered for its presence on \u2018The Soundhouse Tapes\u2019 alone, it\u2019s basically impossible to dislike. (DL)\n\n108. \"The Fallen Angel\" - 'Brave New World' (2000)\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with \u2018The Fallen Angel.\u201d It\u2019s a sturdy Maiden anthem with some great riffs and a huge chorus. It\u2019s just nowhere near as life-affirming as \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d or other classics from \u2018Brave New World.\u2019 So there\u2019s that. (DL)\n\n107. \"The Assassin\" - 'No Prayer for the Dying' (1990)\nOne of the most adventurous and distinctive songs on \u2018No Prayer For The Dying,\u2019 \u201cThe Assassin\u201d was a little out of place on an otherwise disappointingly straightforward album. Worth a second glance, it offers faint clues to Maiden\u2019s eventual rebirth as prog metal overlords. (DL)\n\n106. \"Gates of Tomorrow\" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)\nA decent showcase for the occasional Harris/Dickinson/Gers team-up, \u201cGates Of Tomorrow\u201d is a no-nonsense stormer that was perhaps too firmly rooted in trad Maiden territory to stand out amid the gently eclectic menu offered up by \u2018Dance Of Death.\u2019 (DL)\n\n105. \"The Man of Sorrows\" - 'The Book of Souls (2015)\nAll glory to Mr. Dave Murray on this one. The guitarist\u2019s legato technique is flawless and unparalleled as notes elegantly blossom from his smooth, overtly-melodic delivery. He sets the mood on \u201cThe Man of Sorrows\u201d (not to be confused with Bruce\u2019s \u2018Accident of Birth\u2019 solo track, \u201cMan of Sorrows\u201d), with his fluttering lead work and the song quickly takes on a theme of hope enveloped in uncertainty with striding rhythms, bombastic synths and melancholic melodies. (JD)\n\n104. \"Face in the Sand\" - 'Dance of Death' (2003)\n\u2018Dance Of Death\u2019 was a strange combination of classic Maidenisms and unexpected left-turns. \u201cFace In The Sand\u201d takes an age to get going, but its Floyd-esque slow-build suits the darker intent of mature Maiden perfectly. Extra points for Nicko\u2019s thudding double-kicks. (DL)\n\n103. \"The Fugitive\" - 'Fear of the Dark' (1992)\nA song that promises much but delivers slightly less, \u201cThe Fugitive\u201d is a classic Steve Harris anthem: straight-ahead riffs and linear lyrics, with a bonus detour into moderately proggy territory for the song\u2019s actually rather brilliant instrumental mid-section. (DL)\n\n102. \"When Two Worlds Collide\" - 'Virtual XI' (1998)\nContrary to received wisdom, there are lots of cool moments on \u2018Virtual XI\u2019 and the spooky intro to \u201cWhen Two Worlds Collide\u201d is one of them. Unfortunately, the song then lumbers when it should soar, its relatively lively chorus and neat harmonies somehow lacking that essential Maiden spark. (DL)\n\n101. \"Different World\" - 'A Matter of Life and Death' (2006)\nUnashamedly saluting the melodic power of Thin Lizzy, the opening track on \u2018A Matter Of Life And Death\u2019 is a straightforwardly incisive exercise in hard rock songwriting and strong evidence that Bruce Dickinson should sing in a lower register more often. (DL)\n\n100. \"Mother of Mercy\" - 'The Final Frontier' (2010)\nReaffirming Bruce Dickinson\u2019s ability to hit notes that only dogs can hear, \u201cMother Of Mercy\u201d is not an obvious highlight of \u2018The Final Frontier,\u2019 but it boasts a performance from Bruce that will cheerfully take the paint from your walls. The closing riff is enjoyably gnarly, too. (DL)\n\n99. \"Blood on the World's Hands\" - 'The X Factor' (1995)\n\u2018The X-Factor\u2019 is an album of shadowy terrors and slow-motion menace, but it also has its fair share of quirky moments. \u201cBlood On The World\u2019s Hands\u201d starts with one of Steve Harris\u2019 trademark, rough-hewn bass solos and then transforms into a grinding, epic anti-ballad. (DL)\n\n98. \"The Nomad\" - 'Brave New World' (2000)\nOne of several Maiden songs to transport us all to a vast, bleak and sun-ravaged desert, \u201cThe Nomad\u201d gave \u2018Brave New World\u2019 its most sumptuously epic moment. A tribute to \u201cThe rider of the desert sands,\u201d its opulent sprawl deftly matches the subject matter, scorched grain for grain.
