People keep on givin' in\nMakin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends\nNot respectin' each other, deny thy brother\nA war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover\nThe truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug\nIf you never know truth, then you never know love\nWhere's the love, y'all?

two or three nights\nThen I put it on pause until the moment was right\nI went away for months until our paths crossed again\nShe told me, \"I was never looking for a friend\nMaybe you could swing by my room around ten\nBaby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin\nWe'll be in between the sheets till the late AM\"\nBaby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing\n[Chorus]\nDon't

2]\nAnd for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her\nWe drink away the days with a takeaway pizza\nBefore, a text message was the only way to reach her\nNow she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her\nSinging out Aretha, all over the track like a feature\nAnd never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either\nBut, me and her, we make money the same way\nFour cities, two planes, the same day\nAnd those shows have never been what it's about\nBut maybe we'll go together and just figure it out\nI'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch\nBut we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now\nWish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out\nWhen she was kissing him, how I was confused about\nNow she should figure it out, while I'm sat here

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

spent the night getting caned\n\n[Bridge]\nWithout girls like you, there'd be no fun\nWe'd go to the club and not see anyone\nWithout girls like you, there's no night life\nAll those men just go home

with people who don't even care about my well-being\nI don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend\nSo, you can go back, please, enjoy your party\nI'll be here, somewhere in the corner\nUnder

with my people, we can kick it and just listen to\nSome music with a message, like we usually do\nAnd we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet\nSo, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here\nNot there in the kitchen\nWith the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends\nSo, tell them I'll be here\nRight next to the boy who's throwin' up\n'Cause he

people stood up against the system we all call life\nBut toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice\nA voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some

wife said, I can't say no to nobody\nAnd at this rate, we gon' both die broke\nGot friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt\nAnd like my wife said, I still didn't say no\nPeople tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter\nMy friends' best advice was to stay low\nI guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills\nEspecially when you got family members on payroll\nThe media said it was outlandish spendin'\nThe media said he's way out of control\nI just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'\nI'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control\nI know I'm the most influential\nThat TIME cover was just confirmation\nThis generation's closest thing to Einstein\nSo don't worry about me, I'm fine\nI can see a thousand years from now in real life\nSkate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like\nTroll conventional thought, don't need to question\nI know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive\nThank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission\nDid it with no permission, on our own conditions\nMost blacks with money have been beaten to submission\nYeezy with the big house, did it way different\nNever listen to Hollywood producers\nDon't stare at money too long, it's Medusa\nThe ultimate Gemini has survived\nI wasn't supposed to make it past 25\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nYeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come\nA million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums\nI believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro\nIf the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho\nBrother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation\nHe sat back and smiled\nBlack on black lies is worse than black on black crime\nThe Jews share their truth on how to make a dime\nMost black men couldn't balance a checkbook\nBut buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, \"How my neck look?\"\nWell, it all looks great\nFour hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains\nThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard\nReal family stick together and see through the mirage\nThe smokescreens, perceptions of false reality\nWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?\nI am one with the people\nI am one with the people (Real!)\nI've been woken from enlightened man's dream\nCheckin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem\nLet me not say too much or do too much\n'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch\nI'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen\nSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'\nGod, I have humbled myself before the court\nDrop my ego when confidence was my last resort\nI know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I turned on the news and they was buryin' me\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me\nTold Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see\nI would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov\nI heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove\nBut it's better that I stayed at home with my folks\n'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke\nOnly thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go\nWe all go\nNot just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo\nShe got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo\nModern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow\nYou might also like[Bridge: Sampha]\nNightlife, walk all over me\nWalk all over me\nI'm

feel you in my bed\nNear me, touch me, feel me\nAnd even at the bottom of the sea\nI could still hear inside my head\nTellin' me, touch me, feel me\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd all the time, you were tellin' me lies\n\n[Chorus]\nSo tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you\nTonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you\nI'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight\nI'm gonna find a way to make it without you\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nHave you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?\nWell, you could try sleeping in my bed\n\n[Verse 2]\nLonely, only nobody ever shut it down like you\nYou wore the crown\nYou made my body feel heaven bound\nWhy don't you hold me?\nNear me, I thought you told me\nYou'd never leave me\nLooking in the sky, I could see your face\nAnd I know right where I fit in\nTake me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love\nWith you\nRight 'til the end\nOh\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSo tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you\nTonight, I'm

start\nIt's 'bout to fall apart\nSo rather than hold on to a broken dream\nOr just hold on to love\nAnd I could find a way to make it\nDon't hold on too tight\nI'll make it without you tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nSo tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you\nTonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you\nI'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight\nI'm gonna find a

parents' divorce is on me\nMy therapist's voice is making the choices for me\nAnd I always censor myself 'cause no matter what, they reporting on me\nThe pressure is weighin' on me\nCareer is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly\nMy soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me\nMy chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly\nMy heart feel vacant and lonely, but still\nI'm makin' the most of this shit and more\nEvery single move is like rolling dice on the board\nSeen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys\nI'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord\nAnd if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five\nWell, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more\nI'm bigger now than before\nCo-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport\nNo fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour\nHow could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?\nHow the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?\nHow the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?\n**** windows of opportunity, let me go through the doors\nThis the part where I don't ever say \"Pardon me\" anymore\nThis the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore\nThis the part where all my partners know what we in it for\nThis the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war\nAnd if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket\nWell, this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure\nYou owe that shit to the boy, yeah\n[Outro]\n(I need to make you see)\nI love you, I love you, I love you\n(What you mean to
