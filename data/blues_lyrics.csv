shit, i like to think that at every opportunity i've ever been, uh threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance and not only me but, it goes down my family tree you know what i'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like ""we fighting a war, i'm fighting a war i can't win and i wanna lay it all down"" in this country, a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength and that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back 'cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man, in this country and you don't wanna fight no more and if you don't believe me, you can look around you don't see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers that's crazy, because me being one of your offsprings of the legacy you left behind, i can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so, i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today? i think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed for real, i don't think america know that i think america think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing it's gonna be murder, you know what i'm saying? it's gonna be like nat turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker you know what i'm saying, it's gonna happen that's crazy, man, in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lot a people don't understand how important it is, you know sometimes i can like, get behind a mic and i don't know what type of energy i'ma push out or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes because it's spirits, we ain't even really rappin' we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us damn i wanted to read one last thing to you it's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world, it says: “the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly the butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him he can no longer see past his own thoughts he's trapped when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city the result? wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the same"" what's your perspective on that? pac? pac? pac?!

"queen mab lyricsi how wonderful is death, death, and his brother sleep! one, pale as yonder waning moon with lips of lurid blue; the other, rosy as the morn when throned on ocean's wave it blushes o'er the world; yet both so passing wonderful!  hath then the gloomy power whose reign is in the tainted sepulchres 10 seized on her sinless soul? must then that peerless form which love and admiration cannot view without a beating heart, those azure veins which steal like streams along a field of snow, that lovely outline which is fair as breathing marble, perish? must putrefaction's breath leave nothing of this heavenly sight but loathsomeness and ruin? 20 spare nothing but a gloomy theme, on which the lightest heart might moralize? or is it only a sweet slumber stealing o'er sensation, which the breath of roseate morning chaseth into darkness? will ianthe wake again, and give that faithful bosom joy whose sleepless spirit waits to catch light, life and rapture, from her smile? 30 yes! she will wake again, although her glowing limbs are motionless, and silent those sweet lips, once breathing eloquence that might have soothed a tiger's rage or thawed the cold heart of a conqueror. her dewy eyes are closed, and on their lids, whose texture fine scarce hides the dark blue orbs beneath, the baby sleep is pillowed; 40 her golden tresses shade the bosom's stainless pride, curling like tendrils of the parasite around a marble column.  hark! whence that rushing sound? 't is like the wondrous strain that round a lonely ruin swells, which, wandering on the echoing shore, the enthusiast hears at evening; 't is softer than the west wind's sigh; 50 't is wilder than the unmeasured notes of that strange lyre whose strings the genii of the breezes sweep; those lines of rainbow light are like the moonbeams when they fall through some cathedral window, but the tints are such as may not find comparison on earth. behold the chariot of the fairy queen! celestial coursers paw the unyielding air; 60 their filmy pennons at her word they furl, and stop obedient to the reins of light; these the queen of spells drew in; she spread a charm around the spot, and, leaning graceful from the ethereal car, long did she gaze, and silently, upon the slumbering maid.  oh! not the visioned poet in his dreams, when silvery clouds float through the wildered brain, when every sight of lovely, wild and grand 70 astonishes, enraptures, elevates, when fancy at a glance combines the wondrous and the beautiful,-- so bright, so fair, so wild a shape hath ever yet beheld, as that which reined the coursers of the air and poured the magic of her gaze upon the maiden's sleep.  the broad and yellow moon shone dimly through her form-- 80 that form of faultless symmetry; the pearly and pellucid car moved not the moonlight's line. 't was not an earthly pageant. those, who had looked upon the sight passing all human glory, saw not the yellow moon, saw not the mortal scene, heard not the night-wind's rush, heard not an earthly sound, 90 saw but the fairy pageant, heard but the heavenly strains that filled the lonely dwelling. the fairy's frame was slight--yon fibrous cloud, that catches but the palest tinge of even, and which the straining eye can hardly seize when melting into eastern twilight's shadow, were scarce so thin, so slight; but the fair star that gems the glittering coronet of morn, sheds not a light so mild, so powerful, 100 as that which, bursting from the fairy's form, spread a purpureal halo round the scene, yet with an undulating motion, swayed to her outline gracefully.  from her celestial car the fairy queen descended, and thrice she waved her wand circled with wreaths of amaranth; her thin and misty form moved with the moving air, 110 and the clear silver tones, as thus she spoke, were such as are unheard by all but gifted ear.  fairy 'stars! your balmiest influence shed! elements! your wrath suspend! sleep, ocean, in the rocky bounds that circle thy domain! let not a breath be seen to stir around yon grass-grown ruin's height! let even the restless gossamer 120 sleep on the moveless air! soul of ianthe! thou, judged alone worthy of the envied boon that waits the good and the sincere; that waits those who have struggled, and with resolute will vanquished earth's pride and meanness, burst the chains, the icy chains of custom, and have shone the day-stars of their age;--soul of ianthe! awake! arise!'  sudden arose 130 ianthe's soul; it stood all beautiful in naked purity, the perfect semblance of its bodily frame; instinct with inexpressible beauty and grace-- each stain of earthliness had passed away--it reassumed its native dignity and stood immortal amid ruin.  upon the couch the body lay, wrapt in the depth of slumber; 140 its features were fixed and meaningless, yet animal life was there, and every organ yet performed its natural functions; 'twas a sight of wonder to behold the body and the soul. the self-same lineaments, the same marks of identity were there; yet, oh, how different! one aspires to heaven, pants for its sempiternal heritage, and, ever changing, ever rising still, 150 wantons in endless being: the other, for a time the unwilling sport of circumstance and passion, struggles on; fleets through its sad duration rapidly; then like an useless and worn-out machine, rots, perishes, and passes.  fairy 'spirit! who hast dived so deep; spirit! who hast soared so high; thou the fearless, thou the mild, accept the boon thy worth hath earned, 160 ascend the car with me!'  spirit 'do i dream? is this new feeling but a visioned ghost of slumber? if indeed i am a soul, a free, a disembodied soul, speak again to me.'  fairy 'i am the fairy mab: to me 'tis given the wonders of the human world to keep; the secrets of the immeasurable past, in the unfailing consciences of men, 170 those stern, unflattering chroniclers, i find; the future, from the causes which arise in each event, i gather; not the sting which retributive memory implants in the hard bosom of the selfish man, nor that ecstatic and exulting throb which virtue's votary feels when he sums up the thoughts and actions of a well-spent day, are unforeseen, unregistered by me; and it is yet permitted me to rend 180 the veil of mortal frailty, that the spirit, clothed in its changeless purity, may know how soonest to accomplish the great end for which it hath its being, and may taste that peace which in the end all life will share. this is the meed of virtue; happy soul, ascend the car with me!'  the chains of earth's immurement fell from ianthe's spirit; they shrank and brake like bandages of straw 190 beneath a wakened giant's strength. she knew her glorious change, and felt in apprehension uncontrolled new raptures opening round; each day-dream of her mortal life, each frenzied vision of the slumbers that closed each well-spent day, seemed now to meet reality. the fairy and the soul proceeded; the silver clouds disparted; 200 and as the car of magic they ascended, again the speechless music swelled, again the coursers of the air unfurled their azure pennons, and the queen, shaking the beamy reins, bade them pursue their way.  the magic car moved on. the night was fair, and countless stars studded heaven's dark blue vault; just o'er the eastern wave 210 peeped the first faint smile of morn. the magic car moved on-- from the celestial hoofs the atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew, and where the burning wheels eddied above the mountain's loftiest peak, was traced a line of lightning. now it flew far above a rock, the utmost verge of earth, the rival of the andes, whose dark brow 220 lowered o'er the silver sea.  far, far below the chariot's path, calm as a slumbering babe, tremendous ocean lay. the mirror of its stillness showed the pale and waning stars, the chariot's fiery track, and the gray light of morn tinging those fleecy clouds that canopied the dawn. 230  seemed it that the chariot's way lay through the midst of an immense concave radiant with million constellations, tinged with shades of infinite color, and semicircled with a belt flashing incessant meteors.  the magic car moved on. as they approached their goal, the coursers seemed to gather speed; the sea no longer was distinguished; earth 240 appeared a vast and shadowy sphere; the sun's unclouded orb rolled through the black concave; its rays of rapid light parted around the chariot's swifter course, and fell, like ocean's feathery spray dashed from the boiling surge before a vessel's prow.  the magic car moved on. earth's distant orb appeared 250 the smallest light that twinkles in the heaven; whilst round the chariot's way innumerable systems rolled and countless spheres diffused an ever-varying glory. it was a sight of wonder: some were hornèd like the crescent moon; some shed a mild and silver beam like hesperus o'er the western sea; some dashed athwart with trains of flame, 260 like worlds to death and ruin driven; some shone like suns, and as the chariot passed, eclipsed all other light.  spirit of nature! here-- in this interminable wilderness of worlds, at whose immensity even soaring fancy staggers, here is thy fitting temple! yet not the lightest leaf that quivers to the passing breeze 270 is less instinct with thee; yet not the meanest worm that lurks in graves and fattens on the dead, less shares thy eternal breath! spirit of nature! thou, imperishable as this scene-- here is thy fitting temple!  ii if solitude hath ever led thy steps to the wild ocean's echoing shore, and thou hast lingered there, until the sun's broad orb seemed resting on the burnished wave, thou must have marked the lines of purple gold that motionless hung o'er the sinking sphere; thou must have marked the billowy clouds, edged with intolerable radiancy, 10 towering like rocks of jet crowned with a diamond wreath; and yet there is a moment, when the sun's highest point peeps like a star o'er ocean's western edge, when those far clouds of feathery gold, shaded with deepest purple, gleam like islands on a dark blue sea; then has thy fancy soared above the earth and furled its wearied wing 20 within the fairy's fane.  yet not the golden islands gleaming in yon flood of light, nor the feathery curtains stretching o'er the sun's bright couch, nor the burnished ocean-waves paving that gorgeous dome, so fair, so wonderful a sight as mab's ethereal palace could afford. yet likest evening's vault, that faëry hall! 30 as heaven, low resting on the wave, it spread its floors of flashing light, its vast and azure dome, its fertile golden islands floating on a silver sea; whilst suns their mingling beamings darted through clouds of circumambient darkness, and pearly battlements around looked o'er the immense of heaven.  the magic car no longer moved. 40 the fairy and the spirit entered the hall of spells. those golden clouds that rolled in glittering billows beneath the azure canopy, with the ethereal footsteps trembled not; the light and crimson mists, floating to strains of thrilling melody through that unearthly dwelling, yielded to every movement of the will; 50 upon their passive swell the spirit leaned, and, for the varied bliss that pressed around, used not the glorious privilege of virtue and of wisdom.  'spirit!' the fairy said, and pointed to the gorgeous dome, 'this is a wondrous sight and mocks all human grandeur; but, were it virtue's only meed to dwell in a celestial palace, all resigned 60 to pleasurable impulses, immured within the prison of itself, the will of changeless nature would be unfulfilled. learn to make others happy. spirit, come! this is thine high reward:--the past shall rise; thou shalt behold the present; i will teach the secrets of the future.'  the fairy and the spirit approached the overhanging battlement. below lay stretched the universe! 70 there, far as the remotest line that bounds imagination's flight, countless and unending orbs in mazy motion intermingled, yet still fulfilled immutably eternal nature's law. above, below, around, the circling systems formed a wilderness of harmony; each with undeviating aim, 80 in eloquent silence, through the depths of space pursued its wondrous way.  there was a little light that twinkled in the misty distance. none but a spirit's eye might ken that rolling orb. none but a spirit's eye, and in no other place but that celestial dwelling, might behold each action of this earth's inhabitants. 90 but matter, space, and time, in those aërial mansions cease to act; and all-prevailing wisdom, when it reaps the harvest of its excellence, o'erbounds those obstacles of which an earthly soul fears to attempt the conquest.  the fairy pointed to the earth. the spirit's intellectual eye its kindred beings recognized. the thronging thousands, to a passing view, 100 seemed like an ant-hill's citizens. how wonderful! that even the passions, prejudices, interests, that sway the meanest being--the weak touch that moves the finest nerve and in one human brain causes the faintest thought, becomes a link in the great chain of nature!  'behold,' the fairy cried, 'palmyra's ruined palaces! 110 behold where grandeur frowned! behold where pleasure smiled! what now remains?--the memory of senselessness and shame. what is immortal there? nothing--it stands to tell a melancholy tale, to give an awful warning; soon oblivion will steal silently the remnant of its fame. 120 monarchs and conquerors there proud o'er prostrate millions trod-- the earthquakes of the human race; like them, forgotten when the ruin that marks their shock is past.  'beside the eternal nile the pyramids have risen. nile shall pursue his changeless way; those pyramids shall fall. yea! not a stone shall stand to tell 130 the spot whereon they stood; their very site shall be forgotten, as is their builder's name!  'behold yon sterile spot, where now the wandering arab's tent flaps in the desert blast! there once old salem's haughty fane reared high to heaven its thousand golden domes, and in the blushing face of day exposed its shameful glory. 140 oh! many a widow, many an orphan cursed the building of that fane; and many a father, worn out with toil and slavery, implored the poor man's god to sweep it from the earth and spare his children the detested task of piling stone on stone and poisoning the choicest days of life to soothe a dotard's vanity. there an inhuman and uncultured race howled hideous praises to their demon-god; 150 they rushed to war, tore from the mother's womb the unborn child--old age and infancy promiscuous perished; their victorious arms left not a soul to breathe. oh! they were fiends! but what was he who taught them that the god of nature and benevolence had given a special sanction to the trade of blood? his name and theirs are fading, and the tales of this barbarian nation, which imposture recites till terror credits, are pursuing 160 itself into forgetfulness.  'where athens, rome, and sparta stood, there is a moral desert now. the mean and miserable huts, the yet more wretched palaces, contrasted with those ancient fanes now crumbling to oblivion,-- the long and lonely colonnades through which the ghost of freedom stalks,-- seem like a well-known tune, 170 which in some dear scene we have loved to hear, remembered now in sadness. but, oh! how much more changed, how gloomier is the contrast of human nature there! where socrates expired, a tyrant's slave, a coward and a fool, spreads death around-- then, shuddering, meets his own. where cicero and antoninus lived, a cowled and hypocritical monk 180 prays, curses and deceives.  'spirit! ten thousand years have scarcely passed away, since in the waste, where now the savage drinks his enemy's blood, and, aping europe's sons, wakes the unholy song of war, arose a stately city, metropolis of the western continent. there, now, the mossy column-stone, indented by time's unrelaxing grasp, 190 which once appeared to brave all, save its country's ruin,-- there the wide forest scene, rude in the uncultivated loveliness of gardens long run wild,-- seems, to the unwilling sojourner whose steps chance in that desert has delayed, thus to have stood since earth was what it is. yet once it was the busiest haunt, whither, as to a common centre, flocked 200 strangers, and ships, and merchandise; once peace and freedom blest the cultivated plain; but wealth, that curse of man, blighted the bud of its prosperity; virtue and wisdom, truth and liberty, fled, to return not, until man shall know that they alone can give the bliss worthy a soul that claims its kindred with eternity. 210  'there 's not one atom of yon earth but once was living man; nor the minutest drop of rain, that hangeth in its thinnest cloud, but flowed in human veins; and from the burning plains where libyan monsters yell, from the most gloomy glens of greenland's sunless clime, to where the golden fields 220 of fertile england spread their harvest to the day, thou canst not find one spot whereon no city stood.  'how strange is human pride! i tell thee that those living things, to whom the fragile blade of grass that springeth in the morn and perisheth ere noon, is an unbounded world; 230 i tell thee that those viewless beings, whose mansion is the smallest particle of the impassive atmosphere, think, feel and live like man; that their affections and antipathies, like his, produce the laws ruling their moral state; and the minutest throb that through their frame diffuses the slightest, faintest motion, 240 is fixed and indispensable as the majestic laws that rule yon rolling orbs.'  the fairy paused. the spirit, in ecstasy of admiration, felt all knowledge of the past revived; the events of old and wondrous times, which dim tradition interruptedly teaches the credulous vulgar, were unfolded in just perspective to the view; 250 yet dim from their infinitude. the spirit seemed to stand high on an isolated pinnacle; the flood of ages combating below, the depth of the unbounded universe above, and all around nature's unchanging harmony.  iii 'fairy!' the spirit said, and on the queen of spells fixed her ethereal eyes, 'i thank thee. thou hast given a boon which i will not resign, and taught a lesson not to be unlearned. i know the past, and thence i will essay to glean a warning for the future, so that man may profit by his errors and derive experience from his folly; 10 for, when the power of imparting joy is equal to the will, the human soul requires no other heaven.'  mab 'turn thee, surpassing spirit! much yet remains unscanned. thou knowest how great is man, thou knowest his imbecility; yet learn thou what he is; yet learn the lofty destiny which restless time prepares 20 for every living soul.  'behold a gorgeous palace that amid yon populous city rears its thousand towers and seems itself a city. gloomy troops of sentinels in stern and silent ranks encompass it around; the dweller there cannot be free and happy; hearest thou not the curses of the fatherless, the groans of those who have no friend? he passes on-- the king, the wearer of a gilded chain 30 that binds his soul to abjectness, the fool whom courtiers nickname monarch, whilst a slave even to the basest appetites--that man heeds not the shriek of penury; he smiles at the deep curses which the destitute mutter in secret, and a sullen joy pervades his bloodless heart when thousands groan but for those morsels which his wantonness wastes in unjoyous revelry, to save all that they love from famine; when he hears 40 the tale of horror, to some ready-made face of hypocritical assent he turns, smothering the glow of shame, that, spite of him, flushes his bloated cheek.  now to the meal of silence, grandeur and excess he drags his palled unwilling appetite. if gold, gleaming around, and numerous viands culled from every clime could force the loathing sense to overcome satiety,--if wealth the spring it draws from poisons not,--or vice, 50 unfeeling, stubborn vice, converteth not its food to deadliest venom; then that king is happy; and the peasant who fulfils his unforced task, when he returns at even and by the blazing fagot meets again her welcome for whom all his toil is sped, tastes not a sweeter meal.  behold him now stretched on the gorgeous couch; his fevered brain reels dizzily awhile; but ah! too soon the slumber of intemperance subsides, 60 and conscience, that undying serpent, calls her venomous brood to their nocturnal task. listen! he speaks! oh! mark that frenzied eye-- oh! mark that deadly visage!'  king 'no cessation! oh! must this last forever! awful death, i wish, yet fear to clasp thee!--not one moment of dreamless sleep! o dear and blessèd peace, why dost thou shroud thy vestal purity in penury and dungeons? wherefore lurkest with danger, death, and solitude; yet shun'st 70 the palace i have built thee? sacred peace! oh, visit me but once,--but pitying shed one drop of balm upon my withered soul!'  the fairy 'vain man! that palace is the virtuous heart, and peace defileth not her snowy robes in such a shed as thine. hark! yet he mutters; his slumbers are but varied agonies; they prey like scorpions on the springs of life. there needeth not the hell that bigots frame to punish those who err; earth in itself 80 contains at once the evil and the cure; and all-sufficing nature can chastise those who transgress her law; she only knows how justly to proportion to the fault the punishment it merits.  is it strange that this poor wretch should pride him in his woe? take pleasure in his abjectness, and hug the scorpion that consumes him? is it strange that, placed on a conspicuous throne of thorns, grasping an iron sceptre, and immured 90 within a splendid prison whose stern bounds shut him from all that's good or dear on earth, his soul asserts not its humanity? that man's mild nature rises not in war against a king's employ? no--'tis not strange. he, like the vulgar, thinks, feels, acts, and lives just as his father did; the unconquered powers of precedent and custom interpose between a king and virtue. stranger yet, to those who know not nature nor deduce 100 the future from the present, it may seem, that not one slave, who suffers from the crimes of this unnatural being, not one wretch, whose children famish and whose nuptial bed is earth's unpitying bosom, rears an arm to dash him from his throne!  those gilded flies that, basking in the sunshine of a court, fatten on its corruption! what are they?-- the drones of the community; they feed on the mechanic's labor; the starved hind 110 for them compels the stubborn glebe to yield its unshared harvests; and yon squalid form, leaner than fleshless misery, that wastes a sunless life in the unwholesome mine, drags out in labor a protracted death to glut their grandeur; many faint with toil that few may know the cares and woe of sloth.  whence, thinkest thou, kings and parasites arose? whence that unnatural line of drones who heap toil and unvanquishable penury 120 on those who build their palaces and bring their daily bread?--from vice, black loathsome vice; from rapine, madness, treachery, and wrong; from all that genders misery, and makes of earth this thorny wilderness; from lust, revenge, and murder.--and when reason's voice, loud as the voice of nature, shall have waked the nations; and mankind perceive that vice is discord, war and misery; that virtue is peace and happiness and harmony; 130 when man's maturer nature shall disdain the playthings of its childhood;--kingly glare will lose its power to dazzle, its authority will silently pass by; the gorgeous throne shall stand unnoticed in the regal hall, fast falling to decay; whilst falsehood's trade shall be as hateful and unprofitable as that of truth is now.  where is the fame which the vain-glorious mighty of the earth seek to eternize? oh! the faintest sound 140 from time's light footfall, the minutest wave that swells the flood of ages, whelms in nothing the unsubstantial bubble. ay! to-day stern is the tyrant's mandate, red the gaze that flashes desolation, strong the arm that scatters multitudes. to-morrow comes! that mandate is a thunder-peal that died in ages past; that gaze, a transient flash on which the midnight closed; and on that arm the worm has made his meal.  the virtuous man, 150 who, great in his humility as kings are little in their grandeur; he who leads invincibly a life of resolute good and stands amid the silent dungeon-depths more free and fearless than the trembling judge who, clothed in venal power, vainly strove to bind the impassive spirit;--when he falls, his mild eye beams benevolence no more; withered the hand outstretched but to relieve; sunk reason's simple eloquence that rolled 160 but to appall the guilty. yes! the grave hath quenched that eye and death's relentless frost withered that arm; but the unfading fame which virtue hangs upon its votary's tomb, the deathless memory of that man whom kings call to their minds and tremble, the remembrance with which the happy spirit contemplates its well-spent pilgrimage on earth, shall never pass away.  'nature rejects the monarch, not the man; 170 the subject, not the citizen; for kings and subjects, mutual foes, forever play a losing game into each other's hands, whose stakes are vice and misery. the man of virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys. power, like a desolating pestilence, pollutes whate'er it touches; and obedience, bane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth, makes slaves of men, and of the human frame a mechanized automaton.  when nero 180 high over flaming rome with savage joy lowered like a fiend, drank with enraptured ear the shrieks of agonizing death, beheld the frightful desolation spread, and felt a new-created sense within his soul thrill to the sight and vibrate to the sound,-- thinkest thou his grandeur had not overcome the force of human kindness? and when rome with one stern blow hurled not the tyrant down, crushed not the arm red with her dearest blood, 190 had not submissive abjectness destroyed nature's suggestions?  look on yonder earth: the golden harvests spring; the unfailing sun sheds light and life; the fruits, the flowers, the trees, arise in due succession; all things speak peace, harmony and love. the universe, in nature's silent eloquence, declares that all fulfil the works of love and joy,-- all but the outcast, man. he fabricates the sword which stabs his peace; he cherisheth 200 the snakes that gnaw his heart; he raiseth up the tyrant whose delight is in his woe, whose sport is in his agony. yon sun, lights it the great alone? yon silver beams, sleep they less sweetly on the cottage thatch than on the dome of kings? is mother earth a step-dame to her numerous sons who earn her unshared gifts with unremitting toil; a mother only to those puling babes who, nursed in ease and luxury, make men 210 the playthings of their babyhood and mar in self-important childishness that peace which men alone appreciate?  'spirit of nature, no! the pure diffusion of thy essence throbs alike in every human heart. thou aye erectest there thy throne of power unappealable; thou art the judge beneath whose nod man's brief and frail authority 220 is powerless as the wind that passeth idly by; thine the tribunal which surpasseth the show of human justice as god surpasses man!  'spirit of nature! thou life of interminable multitudes; soul of those mighty spheres whose changeless paths through heaven's deep silence lie; soul of that smallest being, 230 the dwelling of whose life is one faint april sun-gleam;-- man, like these passive things, thy will unconsciously fulfilleth; like theirs, his age of endless peace, which time is fast maturing, will swiftly, surely, come; and the unbounded frame which thou pervadest, will be without a flaw marring its perfect symmetry! 240  iv 'how beautiful this night! the balmiest sigh, which vernal zephyrs breathe in evening's ear, were discord to the speaking quietude that wraps this moveless scene. heaven's ebon vault, studded with stars unutterably bright, through which the moon's unclouded grandeur rolls, seems like a canopy which love had spread to curtain her sleeping world. yon gentle hills. robed in a garment of untrodden snow; yon darksome rocks, whence icicles depend 10 so stainless that their white and glittering spires tinge not the moon's pure beam; yon castled steep whose banner hangeth o'er the time-worn tower so idly that rapt fancy deemeth it a metaphor of peace;--all form a scene where musing solitude might love to lift her soul above this sphere of earthliness; where silence undisturbed might watch alone-- so cold, so bright, so still.  the orb of day in southern climes o'er ocean's waveless field 20 sinks sweetly smiling; not the faintest breath steals o'er the unruffled deep; the clouds of eve reflect unmoved the lingering beam of day; and vesper's image on the western main is beautifully still. to-morrow comes: cloud upon cloud, in dark and deepening mass, roll o'er the blackened waters; the deep roar of distant thunder mutters awfully; tempest unfolds its pinion o'er the gloom that shrouds the boiling surge; the pitiless fiend, 30 with all his winds and lightnings, tracks his prey; the torn deep yawns,--the vessel finds a grave beneath its jagged gulf.  ah! whence yon glare that fires the arch of heaven? that dark red smoke blotting the silver moon? the stars are quenched in darkness, and the pure and spangling snow gleams faintly through the gloom that gathers round. hark to that roar whose swift and deafening peals in countless echoes through the mountains ring, startling pale midnight on her starry throne! 40 now swells the intermingling din; the jar frequent and frightful of the bursting bomb; the falling beam, the shriek, the groan, the shout, the ceaseless clangor, and the rush of men inebriate with rage:--loud and more loud the discord grows; till pale death shuts the scene and o'er the conqueror and the conquered draws his cold and bloody shroud.--of all the men whom day's departing beam saw blooming there in proud and vigorous health; of all the hearts 50 that beat with anxious life at sunset there; how few survive, how few are beating now! all is deep silence, like the fearful calm that slumbers in the storm's portentous pause; save when the frantic wail of widowed love comes shuddering on the blast, or the faint moan with which some soul bursts from the frame of clay wrapt round its struggling powers.  the gray morn dawns on the mournful scene; the sulphurous smoke before the icy wind slow rolls away, 60 and the bright beams of frosty morning dance along the spangling snow. there tracks of blood even to the forest's depth, and scattered arms, and lifeless warriors, whose hard lineaments death's self could change not, mark the dreadful path of the outsallying victors; far behind black ashes note where their proud city stood. within yon forest is a gloomy glen-- each tree which guards its darkness from the day, waves o'er a warrior's tomb.  i see thee shrink, 70 surpassing spirit!--wert thou human else? i see a shade of doubt and horror fleet across thy stainless features; yet fear not; this is no unconnected misery, nor stands uncaused and irretrievable. man's evil nature, that apology which kings who rule, and cowards who crouch, set up for their unnumbered crimes, sheds not the blood which desolates the discord-wasted land. from kings and priests and statesmen war arose, 80 whose safety is man's deep unbettered woe, whose grandeur his debasement. let the axe strike at the root, the poison-tree will fall; and where its venomed exhalations spread ruin, and death, and woe, where millions lay quenching the serpent's famine, and their bones bleaching unburied in the putrid blast, a garden shall arise, in loveliness surpassing fabled eden.  hath nature's soul,-- that formed this world so beautiful, that spread 90 earth's lap with plenty, and life's smallest chord strung to unchanging unison, that gave the happy birds their dwelling in the grove, that yielded to the wanderers of the deep the lovely silence of the unfathomed main, and filled the meanest worm that crawls in dust with spirit, thought and love,--on man alone, partial in causeless malice, wantonly heaped ruin, vice, and slavery; his soul blasted with withering curses; placed afar 100 the meteor-happiness, that shuns his grasp, but serving on the frightful gulf to glare rent wide beneath his footsteps?  nature!--no! kings, priests and statesmen blast the human flower even in its tender bud; their influence darts like subtle poison through the bloodless veins of desolate society. the child, ere he can lisp his mother's sacred name, swells with the unnatural pride of crime, and lifts his baby-sword even in a hero's mood. 110 this infant arm becomes the bloodiest scourge of devastated earth; whilst specious names, learnt in soft childhood's unsuspecting hour, serve as the sophisms with which manhood dims bright reason's ray and sanctifies the sword upraised to shed a brother's innocent blood. let priest-led slaves cease to proclaim that man inherits vice and misery, when force and falsehood hang even o'er the cradled babe, stifling with rudest grasp all natural good. 120  'ah! to the stranger-soul, when first it peeps from its new tenement and looks abroad for happiness and sympathy, how stern and desolate a tract is this wide world! how withered all the buds of natural good! no shade, no shelter from the sweeping storms of pitiless power! on its wretched frame poisoned, perchance, by the disease and woe heaped on the wretched parent whence it sprung by morals, law and custom, the pure winds 130 of heaven, that renovate the insect tribes, may breathe not. the untainting light of day may visit not its longings. it is bound ere it has life; yea, all the chains are forged long ere its being; all liberty and love and peace is torn from its defencelessness; cursed from its birth, even from its cradle doomed to abjectness and bondage!  'throughout this varied and eternal world soul is the only element, the block 140 that for uncounted ages has remained. the moveless pillar of a mountain's weight is active living spirit. every grain is sentient both in unity and part, and the minutest atom comprehends a world of loves and hatreds; these beget evil and good; hence truth and falsehood spring; hence will and thought and action, all the germs of pain or pleasure, sympathy or hate, that variegate the eternal universe. 150 soul is not more polluted than the beams of heaven's pure orb ere round their rapid lines the taint of earth-born atmospheres arise.  'man is of soul and body, formed for deeds of high resolve; on fancy's boldest wing to soar unwearied, fearlessly to turn the keenest pangs to peacefulness, and taste the joys which mingled sense and spirit yield; or he is formed for abjectness and woe, to grovel on the dunghill of his fears, 160 to shrink at every sound, to quench the flame of natural love in sensualism, to know that hour as blest when on his worthless days the frozen hand of death shall set its seal, yet fear the cure, though hating the disease. the one is man that shall hereafter be; the other, man as vice has made him now.  'war is the statesman's game, the priest's delight, the lawyer's jest, the hired assassin's trade, and to those royal murderers whose mean thrones 170 are bought by crimes of treachery and gore, the bread they eat, the staff on which they lean. guards, garbed in blood-red livery, surround their palaces, participate the crimes that force defends and from a nation's rage secures the crown, which all the curses reach that famine, frenzy, woe and penury breathe. these are the hired bravos who defend the tyrant's throne--the bullies of his fear; these are the sinks and channels of worst vice, 180 the refuse of society, the dregs of all that is most vile; their cold hearts blend deceit with sternness, ignorance with pride, all that is mean and villainous with rage which hopelessness of good and self-contempt alone might kindle; they are decked in wealth, honor and power, then are sent abroad to do their work. the pestilence that stalks in gloomy triumph through some eastern land is less destroying. they cajole with gold 190 and promises of fame the thoughtless youth already crushed with servitude; he knows his wretchedness too late, and cherishes repentance for his ruin, when his doom is sealed in gold and blood! those too the tyrant serve, who, skilled to snare the feet of justice in the toils of law, stand ready to oppress the weaker still, and right or wrong will vindicate for gold, sneering at public virtue, which beneath 200 their pitiless tread lies torn and trampled where honor sits smiling at the sale of truth.  'then grave and hoary-headed hypocrites, without a hope, a passion or a love, who through a life of luxury and lies have crept by flattery to the seats of power, support the system whence their honors flow. they have three words--well tyrants know their use, well pay them for the loan with usury torn from a bleeding world!--god, hell and heaven: 210 a vengeful, pitiless, and almighty fiend, whose mercy is a nickname for the rage of tameless tigers hungering for blood; hell, a red gulf of everlasting fire, where poisonous and undying worms prolong eternal misery to those hapless slaves whose life has been a penance for its crimes; and heaven, a meed for those who dare belie their human nature, quake, believe and cringe before the mockeries of earthly power. 220  'these tools the tyrant tempers to his work, wields in his wrath, and as he wills destroys, omnipotent in wickedness; the while youth springs, age moulders, manhood tamely does his bidding, bribed by short-lived joys to lend force to the weakness of his trembling arm. they rise, they fall; one generation comes yielding its harvest to destruction's scythe. it fades, another blossoms; yet behold! red glows the tyrant's stamp-mark on its bloom, 230 withering and cankering deep its passive prime. he has invented lying words and modes, empty and vain as his own coreless heart; evasive meanings, nothings of much sound, to lure the heedless victim to the toils spread round the valley of its paradise.  'look to thyself, priest, conqueror or prince! whether thy trade is falsehood, and thy lusts deep wallow in the earnings of the poor, with whom thy master was; or thou delight'st 240 in numbering o'er the myriads of thy slain, all misery weighing nothing in the scale against thy short-lived fame; or thou dost load with cowardice and crime the groaning land, a pomp-fed king. look to thy wretched self! ay, art thou not the veriest slave that e'er crawled on the loathing earth? are not thy days days of unsatisfying listlessness? dost thou not cry, ere night's long rack is o'er, ""when will the morning come?"" is not thy youth 250 a vain and feverish dream of sensualism? thy manhood blighted with unripe disease? are not thy views of unregretted death drear, comfortless and horrible? thy mind, is it not morbid as thy nerveless frame, incapable of judgment, hope or love? and dost thou wish the errors to survive, that bar thee from all sympathies of good, after the miserable interest thou hold'st in their protraction? when the grave 260 has swallowed up thy memory and thyself, dost thou desire the bane that poisons earth to twine its roots around thy coffined clay, spring from thy bones, and blossom on thy tomb, that of its fruit thy babes may eat and die?  v 'thus do the generations of the earth go to the grave and issue from the womb, surviving still the imperishable change that renovates the world; even as the leaves which the keen frost-wind of the waning year has scattered on the forest-soil and heaped for many seasons there--though long they choke, loading with loathsome rottenness the land, all germs of promise, yet when the tall trees from which they fell, shorn of their lovely shapes, 10 lie level with the earth to moulder there, they fertilize the land they long deformed; till from the breathing lawn a forest springs of youth, integrity and loveliness, like that which gave it life, to spring and die. thus suicidal selfishness, that blights the fairest feelings of the opening heart, is destined to decay, whilst from the soil shall spring all virtue, all delight, all love, and judgment cease to wage unnatural war 20 with passion's unsubduable array. twin-sister of religion, selfishness! rival in crime and falsehood, aping all the wanton horrors of her bloody play; yet frozen, unimpassioned, spiritless, shunning the light, and owning not its name, compelled by its deformity to screen with flimsy veil of justice and of right its unattractive lineaments that scare all save the brood of ignorance; at once 30 the cause and the effect of tyranny; unblushing, hardened, sensual and vile; dead to all love but of its abjectness; with heart impassive by more noble powers than unshared pleasure, sordid gain, or fame; despising its own miserable being, which still it longs, yet fears, to disenthrall.  'hence commerce springs, the venal interchange of all that human art or nature yield; which wealth should purchase not, but want demand, 40 and natural kindness hasten to supply from the full fountain of its boundless love, forever stifled, drained and tainted now. commerce! beneath whose poison-breathing shade no solitary virtue dares to spring, but poverty and wealth with equal hand scatter their withering curses, and unfold the doors of premature and violent death to pining famine and full-fed disease, to all that shares the lot of human life, 50 which, poisoned body and soul, scarce drags the chain that lengthens as it goes and clanks behind.  'commerce has set the mark of selfishness, the signet of its all-enslaving power, upon a shining ore, and called it gold; before whose image bow the vulgar great, the vainly rich, the miserable proud, the mob of peasants, nobles, priests and kings, and with blind feelings reverence the power that grinds them to the dust of misery. 60 but in the temple of their hireling hearts gold is a living god and rules in scorn all earthly things but virtue.  'since tyrants by the sale of human life heap luxuries to their sensualism, and fame to their wide-wasting and insatiate pride, success has sanctioned to a credulous world the ruin, the disgrace, the woe of war. his hosts of blind and unresisting dupes the despot numbers; from his cabinet 70 these puppets of his schemes he moves at will, even as the slaves by force or famine driven, beneath a vulgar master, to perform a task of cold and brutal drudgery;-- hardened to hope, insensible to fear, scarce living pulleys of a dead machine, mere wheels of work and articles of trade, that grace the proud and noisy pomp of wealth!  'the harmony and happiness of man yields to the wealth of nations; that which lifts 80 his nature to the heaven of its pride, is bartered for the poison of his soul; the weight that drags to earth his towering hopes, blighting all prospect but of selfish gain, withering all passion but of slavish fear, extinguishing all free and generous love of enterprise and daring, even the pulse that fancy kindles in the beating heart to mingle with sensation, it destroys,-- leaves nothing but the sordid lust of self, 90 the grovelling hope of interest and gold, unqualified, unmingled, unredeemed even by hypocrisy.  and statesmen boast of wealth! the wordy eloquence that lives after the ruin of their hearts, can gild the bitter poison of a nation's woe; can turn the worship of the servile mob to their corrupt and glaring idol, fame, from virtue, trampled by its iron tread,-- although its dazzling pedestal be raised 100 amid the horrors of a limb-strewn field, with desolated dwellings smoking round. the man of ease, who, by his warm fireside, to deeds of charitable intercourse and bare fulfilment of the common laws of decency and prejudice confines the struggling nature of his human heart, is duped by their cold sophistry; he sheds a passing tear perchance upon the wreck of earthly peace, when near his dwelling's door 110 the frightful waves are driven,--when his son is murdered by the tyrant, or religion drives his wife raving mad. but the poor man whose life is misery, and fear and care; whom the morn wakens but to fruitless toil; who ever hears his famished offspring's scream; whom their pale mother's uncomplaining gaze forever meets, and the proud rich man's eye flashing command, and the heart-breaking scene of thousands like himself;--he little heeds 120 the rhetoric of tyranny; his hate is quenchless as his wrongs; he laughs to scorn the vain and bitter mockery of words, feeling the horror of the tyrant's deeds, and unrestrained but by the arm of power, that knows and dreads his enmity.  'the iron rod of penury still compels her wretched slave to bow the knee to wealth, and poison, with unprofitable toil, a life too void of solace to confirm 130 the very chains that bind him to his doom. nature, impartial in munificence, has gifted man with all-subduing will. matter, with all its transitory shapes, lies subjected and plastic at his feet, that, weak from bondage, tremble as they tread. how many a rustic milton has passed by, stifling the speechless longings of his heart, in unremitting drudgery and care! how many a vulgar cato has compelled 140 his energies, no longer tameless then, to mould a pin or fabricate a nail! how many a newton, to whose passive ken those mighty spheres that gem infinity were only specks of tinsel fixed in heaven to light the midnights of his native town!  'yet every heart contains perfection's germ. the wisest of the sages of the earth, that ever from the stores of reason drew science and truth, and virtue's dreadless tone, 150 were but a weak and inexperienced boy, proud, sensual, unimpassioned, unimbued with pure desire and universal love, compared to that high being, of cloudless brain, untainted passion, elevated will, which death (who even would linger long in awe within his noble presence and beneath his changeless eye-beam) might alone subdue. him, every slave now dragging through the filth of some corrupted city his sad life, 160 pining with famine, swoln with luxury, blunting the keenness of his spiritual sense with narrow schemings and unworthy cares, or madly rushing through all violent crime to move the deep stagnation of his soul,-- might imitate and equal.  but mean lust has bound its chains so tight about the earth that all within it but the virtuous man is venal; gold or fame will surely reach the price prefixed by selfishness to all 170 but him of resolute and unchanging will; whom nor the plaudits of a servile crowd, nor the vile joys of tainting luxury, can bribe to yield his elevated soul to tyranny or falsehood, though they wield with blood-red hand the sceptre of the world.  'all things are sold: the very light of heaven is venal; earth's unsparing gifts of love, the smallest and most despicable things that lurk in the abysses of the deep, 180 all objects of our life, even life itself, and the poor pittance which the laws allow of liberty, the fellowship of man, those duties which his heart of human love should urge him to perform instinctively, are bought and sold as in a public mart of undisguising selfishness, that sets on each its price, the stamp-mark of her reign. even love is sold; the solace of all woe is turned to deadliest agony, old age 190 shivers in selfish beauty's loathing arms, and youth's corrupted impulses prepare a life of horror from the blighting bane of commerce; whilst the pestilence that springs from unenjoying sensualism, has filled all human life with hydra-headed woes.  'falsehood demands but gold to pay the pangs of outraged conscience; for the slavish priest sets no great value on his hireling faith; a little passing pomp, some servile souls, 200 whom cowardice itself might safely chain or the spare mite of avarice could bribe to deck the triumph of their languid zeal, can make him minister to tyranny. more daring crime requires a loftier meed. without a shudder the slave-soldier lends his arm to murderous deeds, and steels his heart, when the dread eloquence of dying men, low mingling on the lonely field of fame, assails that nature whose applause he sells 210 for the gross blessings of the patriot mob, for the vile gratitude of heartless kings, and for a cold world's good word,--viler still!  'there is a nobler glory which survives until our being fades, and, solacing all human care, accompanies its change; deserts not virtue in the dungeon's gloom, and in the precincts of the palace guides its footsteps through that labyrinth of crime; imbues his lineaments with dauntlessness, 220 even when from power's avenging hand he takes its sweetest, last and noblest title--death; --the consciousness of good, which neither gold, nor sordid fame, nor hope of heavenly bliss, can purchase; but a life of resolute good, unalterable will, quenchless desire of universal happiness, the heart that beats with it in unison, the brain whose ever-wakeful wisdom toils to change reason's rich stores for its eternal weal. 230  'this commerce of sincerest virtue needs no meditative signs of selfishness, no jealous intercourse of wretched gain, no balancings of prudence, cold and long; in just and equal measure all is weighed, one scale contains the sum of human weal, and one, the good man's heart.  how vainly seek the selfish for that happiness denied to aught but virtue! blind and hardened, they, who hope for peace amid the storms of care, 240 who covet power they know not how to use, and sigh for pleasure they refuse to give,-- madly they frustrate still their own designs; and, where they hope that quiet to enjoy which virtue pictures, bitterness of soul, pining regrets, and vain repentances, disease, disgust and lassitude pervade their valueless and miserable lives.  'but hoary-headed selfishness has felt its death-blow and is tottering to the grave; 250 a brighter morn awaits the human day, when every transfer of earth's natural gifts shall be a commerce of good words and works; when poverty and wealth, the thirst of fame, the fear of infamy, disease and woe, war with its million horrors, and fierce hell, shall live but in the memory of time, who, like a penitent libertine, shall start, look back, and shudder at his younger years.'  vi all touch, all eye, all ear, the spirit felt the fairy's burning speech. o'er the thin texture of its frame the varying periods painted changing glows, as on a summer even, when soul-enfolding music floats around, the stainless mirror of the lake re-images the eastern gloom, mingling convulsively its purple hues with sunset's burnished gold. 10 then thus the spirit spoke: 'it is a wild and miserable world! thorny, and full of care, which every fiend can make his prey at will! o fairy! in the lapse of years, is there no hope in store? will yon vast suns roll on interminably, still illuming the night of so many wretched souls, and see no hope for them? 20 will not the universal spirit e'er revivify this withered limb of heaven?'  the fairy calmly smiled in comfort, and a kindling gleam of hope suffused the spirit's lineaments. 'oh! rest thee tranquil; chase those fearful doubts which ne'er could rack an everlasting soul that sees the chains which bind it to its doom. yes! crime and misery are in yonder earth, falsehood, mistake and lust; 30 but the eternal world contains at once the evil and the cure. some eminent in virtue shall start up, even in perversest time; the truths of their pure lips, that never die, shall bind the scorpion falsehood with a wreath of ever-living flame, until the monster sting itself to death.  'how sweet a scene will earth become! of purest spirits a pure dwelling-place, 40 symphonious with the planetary spheres; when man, with changeless nature coalescing, will undertake regeneration's work, when its ungenial poles no longer point to the red and baleful sun that faintly twinkles there!  'spirit, on yonder earth, falsehood now triumphs; deadly power has fixed its seal upon the lip of truth! madness and misery are there! 50 the happiest is most wretched! yet confide until pure health-drops from the cup of joy fall like a dew of balm upon the world. now, to the scene i show, in silence turn, and read the blood-stained charter of all woe, which nature soon with recreating hand will blot in mercy from the book of earth. how bold the flight of passion's wandering wing, how swift the step of reason's firmer tread, how calm and sweet the victories of life, 60 how terrorless the triumph of the grave! how powerless were the mightiest monarch's arm, vain his loud threat, and impotent his frown! how ludicrous the priest's dogmatic roar! the weight of his exterminating curse how light! and his affected charity, to suit the pressure of the changing times, what palpable deceit!--but for thy aid, religion! but for thee, prolific fiend, who peoplest earth with demons, hell with men, 70 and heaven with slaves!  'thou taintest all thou lookest upon!--the stars, which on thy cradle beamed so brightly sweet, were gods to the distempered playfulness of thy untutored infancy; the trees, the grass, the clouds, the mountains and the sea, all living things that walk, swim, creep or fly, were gods; the sun had homage, and the moon her worshipper. then thou becamest, a boy, more daring in thy frenzies; every shape, 80 monstrous or vast, or beautifully wild, which from sensation's relics fancy culls; the spirits of the air, the shuddering ghost, the genii of the elements, the powers that give a shape to nature's varied works, had life and place in the corrupt belief of thy blind heart; yet still thy youthful hands were pure of human blood. then manhood gave its strength and ardor to thy frenzied brain; thine eager gaze scanned the stupendous scene, 90 whose wonders mocked the knowledge of thy pride; their everlasting and unchanging laws reproached thine ignorance. awhile thou stood'st baffled and gloomy; then thou didst sum up the elements of all that thou didst know; the changing seasons, winter's leafless reign, the budding of the heaven-breathing trees, the eternal orbs that beautify the night, the sunrise, and the setting of the moon, earthquakes and wars, and poisons and disease, 100 and all their causes, to an abstract point converging thou didst bend, and called it god! the self-sufficing, the omnipotent, the merciful, and the avenging god! who, prototype of human misrule, sits high in heaven's realm, upon a golden throne, even like an earthly king; and whose dread work, hell, gapes forever for the unhappy slaves of fate, whom he created in his sport to triumph in their torments when they fell! 110 earth heard the name; earth trembled as the smoke of his revenge ascended up to heaven, blotting the constellations; and the cries of millions butchered in sweet confidence and unsuspecting peace, even when the bonds of safety were confirmed by wordy oaths sworn in his dreadful name, rung through the land; whilst innocent babes writhed on thy stubborn spear, and thou didst laugh to hear the mother's shriek of maniac gladness, as the sacred steel 120 felt cold in her torn entrails!  'religion! thou wert then in manhood's prime; but age crept on; one god would not suffice for senile puerility; thou framedst a tale to suit thy dotage and to glut thy misery-thirsting soul, that the mad fiend thy wickedness had pictured might afford a plea for sating the unnatural thirst for murder, rapine, violence and crime, that still consumed thy being, even when 130 thou heard'st the step of fate; that flames might light thy funeral scene; and the shrill horrent shrieks of parents dying on the pile that burned to light their children to thy paths, the roar of the encircling flames, the exulting cries of thine apostles loud commingling there, might sate thine hungry ear even on the bed of death!  'but now contempt is mocking thy gray hairs; thou art descending to the darksome grave, 140 unhonored and unpitied but by those whose pride is passing by like thine, and sheds, like thine, a glare that fades before the sun of truth, and shines but in the dreadful night that long has lowered above the ruined world.  'throughout these infinite orbs of mingling light of which yon earth is one, is wide diffused a spirit of activity and life, that knows no term, cessation or decay; that fades not when the lamp of earthly life, 150 extinguished in the dampness of the grave, awhile there slumbers, more than when the babe in the dim newness of its being feels the impulses of sublunary things, and all is wonder to unpractised sense; but, active, steadfast and eternal, still guides the fierce whirlwind, in the tempest roars, cheers in the day, breathes in the balmy groves, strengthens in health, and poisons in disease; and in the storm of change, that ceaselessly 160 rolls round the eternal universe and shakes its undecaying battlement, presides, apportioning with irresistible law the place each spring of its machine shall fill; so that, when waves on waves tumultuous heap confusion to the clouds, and fiercely driven heaven's lightnings scorch the uprooted ocean-fords-- whilst, to the eye of shipwrecked mariner, lone sitting on the bare and shuddering rock, all seems unlinked contingency and chance-- 170 no atom of this turbulence fulfils a vague and unnecessitated task or acts but as it must and ought to act. even the minutest molecule of light, that in an april sunbeam's fleeting glow fulfils its destined though invisible work, the universal spirit guides; nor less when merciless ambition, or mad zeal, has led two hosts of dupes to battle-field, that, blind, they there may dig each other's graves 180 and call the sad work glory, does it rule all passions; not a thought, a will, an act, no working of the tyrant's moody mind, nor one misgiving of the slaves who boast their servitude to hide the shame they feel, nor the events enchaining every will, that from the depths of unrecorded time have drawn all-influencing virtue, pass unrecognized or unforeseen by thee, soul of the universe! eternal spring 190 of life and death, of happiness and woe, of all that chequers the phantasmal scene that floats before our eyes in wavering light, which gleams but on the darkness of our prison whose chains and massy walls we feel but cannot see.  'spirit of nature! all-sufficing power, necessity! thou mother of the world! unlike the god of human error, thou requirest no prayers or praises; the caprice 200 of man's weak will belongs no more to thee than do the changeful passions of his breast to thy unvarying harmony; the slave, whose horrible lusts spread misery o'er the world, and the good man, who lifts with virtuous pride his being in the sight of happiness that springs from his own works; the poison-tree, beneath whose shade all life is withered up, and the fair oak, whose leafy dome affords a temple where the vows of happy love 210 are registered, are equal in thy sight; no love, no hate thou cherishest; revenge and favoritism, and worst desire of fame thou knowest not; all that the wide world contains are but thy passive instruments, and thou regard'st them all with an impartial eye, whose joy or pain thy nature cannot feel, because thou hast not human sense, because thou art not human mind.  'yes! when the sweeping storm of time 220 has sung its death-dirge o'er the ruined fanes and broken altars of the almighty fiend, whose name usurps thy honors, and the blood through centuries clotted there has floated down the tainted flood of ages, shalt thou live unchangeable! a shrine is raised to thee, which nor the tempest breath of time, nor the interminable flood over earth's slight pageant rolling, availeth to destroy,-- 230 the sensitive extension of the world; that wondrous and eternal fane, where pain and pleasure, good and evil join, to do the will of strong necessity, and life, in multitudinous shapes, still pressing forward where no term can be, like hungry and unresting flame curls round the eternal columns of its strength.'  vii spirit 'i was an infant when my mother went to see an atheist burned. she took me there. the dark-robed priests were met around the pile; the multitude was gazing silently; and as the culprit passed with dauntless mien, tempered disdain in his unaltering eye, mixed with a quiet smile, shone calmly forth; the thirsty fire crept round his manly limbs; his resolute eyes were scorched to blindness soon; his death-pang rent my heart! the insensate mob 10 uttered a cry of triumph, and i wept. ""weep not, child!"" cried my mother, ""for that man has said, there is no god.""'  fairy 'there is no god! nature confirms the faith his death-groan sealed. let heaven and earth, let man's revolving race, his ceaseless generations, tell their tale; let every part depending on the chain that links it to the whole, point to the hand that grasps its term! let every seed that falls in silent eloquence unfold its store 20 of argument; infinity within, infinity without, belie creation; the exterminable spirit it contains is nature's only god; but human pride is skilful to invent most serious names to hide its ignorance. 'the name of god has fenced about all crime with holiness, himself the creature of his worshippers, whose names and attributes and passions change, seeva, buddh, foh, jehovah, god, or lord, 30 even with the human dupes who build his shrines, still serving o'er the war-polluted world for desolation's watchword; whether hosts stain his death-blushing chariot-wheels, as on triumphantly they roll, whilst brahmins raise a sacred hymn to mingle with the groans; or countless partners of his power divide his tyranny to weakness; or the smoke of burning towns, the cries of female helplessness, unarmed old age, and youth, and infancy, 40 horribly massacred, ascend to heaven in honor of his name; or, last and worst, earth groans beneath religion's iron age, and priests dare babble of a god of peace, even whilst their hands are red with guiltless blood, murdering the while, uprooting every germ of truth, exterminating, spoiling all, making the earth a slaughter-house!  'o spirit! through the sense by which thy inner nature was apprised 50 of outward shows, vague dreams have rolled, and varied reminiscences have waked tablets that never fade; all things have been imprinted there, the stars, the sea, the earth, the sky, even the unshapeliest lineaments of wild and fleeting visions have left a record there to testify of earth.  'these are my empire, for to me is given 60 the wonders of the human world to keep, and fancy's thin creations to endow with manner, being and reality; therefore a wondrous phantom from the dreams of human error's dense and purblind faith i will evoke, to meet thy questioning. ahasuerus, rise!'  a strange and woe-worn wight arose beside the battlement, and stood unmoving there. 70 his inessential figure cast no shade upon the golden floor; his port and mien bore mark of many years, and chronicles of untold ancientness were legible within his beamless eye; yet his cheek bore the mark of youth; freshness and vigor knit his manly frame; the wisdom of old age was mingled there with youth's primeval dauntlessness; and inexpressible woe, 80 chastened by fearless resignation, gave an awful grace to his all-speaking brow.  spirit 'is there a god?'  ahasuerus 'is there a god!--ay, an almighty god, and vengeful as almighty! once his voice was heard on earth; earth shuddered at the sound; the fiery-visaged firmament expressed abhorrence, and the grave of nature yawned to swallow all the dauntless and the good that dared to hurl defiance at his throne, 90 girt as it was with power. none but slaves survived,--cold-blooded slaves, who did the work of tyrannous omnipotence; whose souls no honest indignation ever urged to elevated daring, to one deed which gross and sensual self did not pollute. these slaves built temples for the omnipotent fiend, gorgeous and vast; the costly altars smoked with human blood, and hideous pæans rung through all the long-drawn aisles. a murderer heard 100 his voice in egypt, one whose gifts and arts had raised him to his eminence in power, accomplice of omnipotence in crime and confidant of the all-knowing one. these were jehovah's words.  '""from an eternity of idleness i, god, awoke; in seven days' toil made earth from nothing; rested, and created man; i placed him in a paradise, and there planted the tree of evil, so that he 110 might eat and perish, and my soul procure wherewith to sate its malice and to turn, even like a heartless conqueror of the earth, all misery to my fame. the race of men, chosen to my honor, with impunity may sate the lusts i planted in their heart. here i command thee hence to lead them on, until with hardened feet their conquering troops wade on the promised soil through woman's blood, and make my name be dreaded through the land. 120 yet ever-burning flame and ceaseless woe shall be the doom of their eternal souls, with every soul on this ungrateful earth, virtuous or vicious, weak or strong,--even all shall perish, to fulfil the blind revenge (which you, to men, call justice) of their god.""  'the murderer's brow quivered with horror.  '""god omnipotent, is there no mercy? must our punishment be endless? will long ages roll away, 130 and see no term? oh! wherefore hast thou made in mockery and wrath this evil earth? mercy becomes the powerful--be but just! o god! repent and save!""  '""one way remains: i will beget a son and he shall bear the sins of all the world; he shall arise in an unnoticed corner of the earth, and there shall die upon a cross, and purge the universal crime; so that the few on whom my grace descends, those who are marked 140 as vessels to the honor of their god, may credit this strange sacrifice and save their souls alive. millions shall live and die, who ne'er shall call upon their saviour's name, but, unredeemed, go to the gaping grave, thousands shall deem it an old woman's tale, such as the nurses frighten babes withal; these in a gulf of anguish and of flame shall curse their reprobation endlessly, yet tenfold pangs shall force them to avow, 150 even on their beds of torment where they howl, my honor and the justice of their doom. what then avail their virtuous deeds, their thoughts of purity, with radiant genius bright or lit with human reason's earthly ray? many are called, but few will i elect. do thou my bidding, moses!""  'even the murderer's cheek was blanched with horror, and his quivering lips scarce faintly uttered--""o almighty one, i tremble and obey!"" 160  'o spirit! centuries have set their seal on this heart of many wounds, and loaded brain, since the incarnate came; humbly he came, veiling his horrible godhead in the shape of man, scorned by the world, his name unheard save by the rabble of his native town, even as a parish demagogue. he led the crowd; he taught them justice, truth and peace, in semblance; but he lit within their souls the quenchless flames of zeal, and blessed the sword 170 he brought on earth to satiate with the blood of truth and freedom his malignant soul at length his mortal frame was led to death. i stood beside him; on the torturing cross no pain assailed his unterrestrial sense; and yet he groaned. indignantly i summed the massacres and miseries which his name had sanctioned in my country, and i cried, ""go! go!"" in mockery. a smile of godlike malice reillumined 180 his fading lineaments. ""i go,"" he cried, ""but thou shalt wander o'er the unquiet earth eternally."" the dampness of the grave bathed my imperishable front. i fell, and long lay tranced upon the charmèd soil. when i awoke hell burned within my brain which staggered on its seat; for all around the mouldering relics of my kindred lay, even as the almighty's ire arrested them, and in their various attitudes of death 190 my murdered children's mute and eyeless skulls glared ghastily upon me.  but my soul, from sight and sense of the polluting woe of tyranny, had long learned to prefer hell's freedom to the servitude of heaven. therefore i rose, and dauntlessly began my lonely and unending pilgrimage, resolved to wage unweariable war with my almighty tyrant and to hurl defiance at his impotence to harm 200 beyond the curse i bore. the very hand, that barred my passage to the peaceful grave, has crushed the earth to misery, and given its empire to the chosen of his slaves. these i have seen, even from the earliest dawn of weak, unstable and precarious power, then preaching peace, as now they practise war; so, when they turned but from the massacre of unoffending infidels to quench their thirst for ruin in the very blood 210 that flowed in their own veins, and pitiless zeal froze every human feeling as the wife sheathed in her husband's heart the sacred steel, even whilst its hopes were dreaming of her love; and friends to friends, brothers to brothers stood opposed in bloodiest battle-field, and war, scarce satiable by fate's last death-draught, waged, drunk from the wine-press of the almighty's wrath; whilst the red cross, in mockery of peace, pointed to victory! when the fray was done, 220 no remnant of the exterminated faith survived to tell its ruin, but the flesh, with putrid smoke poisoning the atmosphere, that rotted on the half-extinguished pile.  'yes! i have seen god's worshippers unsheathe the sword of his revenge, when grace descended, confirming all unnatural impulses, to sanctify their desolating deeds; and frantic priests waved the ill-omened cross o'er the unhappy earth; then shone the sun 230 on showers of gore from the upflashing steel of safe assassination, and all crime made stingless by the spirits of the lord, and blood-red rainbows canopied the land.  'spirit! no year of my eventful being has passed unstained by crime and misery, which flows from god's own faith. i 've marked his slaves with tongues, whose lies are venomous, beguile the insensate mob, and, whilst one hand was red with murder, feign to stretch the other out 240 for brotherhood and peace; and that they now babble of love and mercy, whilst their deeds are marked with all the narrowness and crime that freedom's young arm dare not yet chastise, reason may claim our gratitude, who now, establishing the imperishable throne of truth and stubborn virtue, maketh vain the unprevailing malice of my foe, whose bootless rage heaps torments for the brave, adds impotent eternities to pain, 250 whilst keenest disappointment racks his breast to see the smiles of peace around them play, to frustrate or to sanctify their doom.  'thus have i stood,--through a wild waste of years struggling with whirlwinds of mad agony, yet peaceful, and serene, and self-enshrined, mocking my powerless tyrant's horrible curse with stubborn and unalterable will, even as a giant oak, which heaven's fierce flame had scathèd in the wilderness, to stand 260 a monument of fadeless ruin there; yet peacefully and movelessly it braves the midnight conflict of the wintry storm, as in the sunlight's calm it spreads its worn and withered arms on high to meet the quiet of a summer's noon.'  the fairy waved her wand; ahasuerus fled fast as the shapes of mingled shade and mist, that lurk in the glens of a twilight grove, 270 flee from the morning beam;-- the matter of which dreams are made not more endowed with actual life than this phantasmal portraiture of wandering human thought.  viii the fairy 'the present and the past thou hast beheld. it was a desolate sight. now, spirit, learn, the secrets of the future.--time! unfold the brooding pinion of thy gloom, render thou up thy half-devoured babes, and from the cradles of eternity, where millions lie lulled to their portioned sleep by the deep murmuring stream of passing things, tear thou that gloomy shroud.--spirit, behold thy glorious destiny!' 10  joy to the spirit came. through the wide rent in time's eternal veil, hope was seen beaming through the mists of fear; earth was no longer hell; love, freedom, health had given their ripeness to the manhood of its prime, and all its pulses beat symphonious to the planetary spheres; then dulcet music swelled concordant with the life-strings of the soul; 20 it throbbed in sweet and languid beatings there, catching new life from transitory death; like the vague sighings of a wind at even that wakes the wavelets of the slumbering sea and dies on the creation of its breath, and sinks and rises, falls and swells by fits, was the pure stream of feeling that sprung from these sweet notes, and o'er the spirit's human sympathies with mild and gentle motion calmly flowed. 30  joy to the spirit came,-- such joy as when a lover sees the chosen of his soul in happiness and witnesses her peace whose woe to him were bitterer than death; sees her unfaded cheek glow mantling in first luxury of health, thrills with her lovely eyes, which like two stars amid the heaving main sparkle through liquid bliss. 40  then in her triumph spoke the fairy queen: 'i will not call the ghost of ages gone to unfold the frightful secrets of its lore; the present now is past, and those events that desolate the earth have faded from the memory of time, who dares not give reality to that whose being i annul. to me is given the wonders of the human world to keep, space, matter, time and mind. futurity 50 exposes now its treasure; let the sight renew and strengthen all thy failing hope. o human spirit! spur thee to the goal where virtue fixes universal peace, and, 'midst the ebb and flow of human things, show somewhat stable, somewhat certain still, a light-house o'er the wild of dreary waves.  'the habitable earth is full of bliss; those wastes of frozen billows that were hurled by everlasting snow-storms round the poles, 60 where matter dared not vegetate or live, but ceaseless frost round the vast solitude bound its broad zone of stillness, are unloosed; and fragrant zephyrs there from spicy isles ruffle the placid ocean-deep, that rolls its broad, bright surges to the sloping sand, whose roar is wakened into echoings sweet to murmur through the heaven-breathing groves and melodize with man's blest nature there.  'those deserts of immeasurable sand, 70 whose age-collected fervors scarce allowed a bird to live, a blade of grass to spring, where the shrill chirp of the green lizard's love broke on the sultry silentness alone, now teem with countless rills and shady woods, cornfields and pastures and white cottages; and where the startled wilderness beheld a savage conqueror stained in kindred blood, a tigress sating with the flesh of lambs the unnatural famine of her toothless cubs, 80 whilst shouts and howlings through the desert rang,-- sloping and smooth the daisy-spangled lawn, offering sweet incense to the sunrise, smiles to see a babe before his mother's door, sharing his morning's meal with the green and golden basilisk that comes to lick his feet.  'those trackless deeps, where many a weary sail has seen above the illimitable plain morning on night and night on morning rise, 90 whilst still no land to greet the wanderer spread its shadowy mountains on the sun-bright sea, where the loud roarings of the tempest-waves so long have mingled with the gusty wind in melancholy loneliness, and swept the desert of those ocean solitudes but vocal to the sea-bird's harrowing shriek, the bellowing monster, and the rushing storm; now to the sweet and many-mingling sounds of kindliest human impulses respond. 100 those lonely realms bright garden-isles begem, with lightsome clouds and shining seas between, and fertile valleys, resonant with bliss, whilst green woods overcanopy the wave, which like a toil-worn laborer leaps to shore to meet the kisses of the flowrets there.  'all things are recreated, and the flame of consentaneous love inspires all life. the fertile bosom of the earth gives suck to myriads, who still grow beneath her care, 110 rewarding her with their pure perfectness; the balmy breathings of the wind inhale her virtues and diffuse them all abroad; health floats amid the gentle atmosphere, glows in the fruits and mantles on the stream; no storms deform the beaming brow of heaven, nor scatter in the freshness of its pride the foliage of the ever-verdant trees; but fruits are ever ripe, flowers ever fair, and autumn proudly bears her matron grace, 120 kindling a flush on the fair cheek of spring, whose virgin bloom beneath the ruddy fruit reflects its tint and blushes into love.  'the lion now forgets to thirst for blood; there might you see him sporting in the sun beside the dreadless kid; his claws are sheathed, his teeth are harmless, custom's force has made his nature as the nature of a lamb. like passion's fruit, the nightshade's tempting bane poisons no more the pleasure it bestows; 130 all bitterness is past; the cup of joy unmingled mantles to the goblet's brim and courts the thirsty lips it fled before.  but chief, ambiguous man, he that can know more misery, and dream more joy than all; whose keen sensations thrill within his breast to mingle with a loftier instinct there, lending their power to pleasure and to pain, yet raising, sharpening, and refining each; who stands amid the ever-varying world, 140 the burden or the glory of the earth; he chief perceives the change; his being notes the gradual renovation and defines each movement of its progress on his mind.  'man, where the gloom of the long polar night lowers o'er the snow-clad rocks and frozen soil, where scarce the hardiest herb that braves the frost basks in the moonlight's ineffectual glow, shrank with the plants, and darkened with the night; his chilled and narrow energies, his heart 150 insensible to courage, truth or love, his stunted stature and imbecile frame, marked him for some abortion of the earth, fit compeer of the bears that roamed around, whose habits and enjoyments were his own; his life a feverish dream of stagnant woe, whose meagre wants, but scantily fulfilled, apprised him ever of the joyless length which his short being's wretchedness had reached; his death a pang which famine, cold and toil 160 long on the mind, whilst yet the vital spark clung to the body stubbornly, had brought: all was inflicted here that earth's revenge could wreak on the infringers of her law; one curse alone was spared--the name of god.  'nor, where the tropics bound the realms of day with a broad belt of mingling cloud and flame, where blue mists through the unmoving atmosphere scattered the seeds of pestilence and fed unnatural vegetation, where the land 170 teemed with all earthquake, tempest and disease, was man a nobler being; slavery had crushed him to his country's blood-stained dust; or he was bartered for the fame of power, which, all internal impulses destroying, makes human will an article of trade; or he was changed with christians for their gold and dragged to distant isles, where to the sound of the flesh-mangling scourge he does the work of all-polluting luxury and wealth, 180 which doubly visits on the tyrants' heads the long-protracted fulness of their woe; or he was led to legal butchery, to turn to worms beneath that burning sun where kings first leagued against the rights of men and priests first traded with the name of god.  'even where the milder zone afforded man a seeming shelter, yet contagion there, blighting his being with unnumbered ills, spread like a quenchless fire; nor truth till late 190 availed to arrest its progress or create that peace which first in bloodless victory waved her snowy standard o'er this favored clime; there man was long the train-bearer of slaves, the mimic of surrounding misery, the jackal of ambition's lion-rage, the bloodhound of religion's hungry zeal.  'here now the human being stands adorning this loveliest earth with taintless body and mind; blest from his birth with all bland impulses, 200 which gently in his noble bosom wake all kindly passions and all pure desires. him, still from hope to hope the bliss pursuing which from the exhaustless store of human weal draws on the virtuous mind, the thoughts that rise in time-destroying infiniteness gift with self-enshrined eternity, that mocks the unprevailing hoariness of age; and man, once fleeting o'er the transient scene swift as an unremembered vision, stands 210 immortal upon earth; no longer now he slays the lamb that looks him in the face, and horribly devours his mangled flesh, which, still avenging nature's broken law, kindled all putrid humors in his frame, all evil passions and all vain belief, hatred, despair and loathing in his mind, the germs of misery, death, disease and crime. no longer now the wingèd habitants, that in the woods their sweet lives sing away, 220 flee from the form of man; but gather round, and prune their sunny feathers on the hands which little children stretch in friendly sport towards these dreadless partners of their play. all things are void of terror; man has lost his terrible prerogative, and stands an equal amidst equals; happiness and science dawn, though late, upon the earth; peace cheers the mind, health renovates the frame; disease and pleasure cease to mingle here, 230 reason and passion cease to combat there; whilst each unfettered o'er the earth extend their all-subduing energies, and wield the sceptre of a vast dominion there; whilst every shape and mode of matter lends its force to the omnipotence of mind, which from its dark mine drags the gem of truth to decorate its paradise of peace.'  ix 'o happy earth, reality of heaven! to which those restless souls that ceaselessly throng through the human universe, aspire! thou consummation of all mortal hope! thou glorious prize of blindly working will, whose rays, diffused throughout all space and time, verge to one point and blend forever there! of purest spirits thou pure dwelling-place where care and sorrow, impotence and crime, languor, disease and ignorance dare not come! 10 o happy earth, reality of heaven!  'genius has seen thee in her passionate dreams; and dim forebodings of thy loveliness, haunting the human heart, have there entwined those rooted hopes of some sweet place of bliss, where friends and lovers meet to part no more. thou art the end of all desire and will, the product of all action; and the souls, that by the paths of an aspiring change have reached thy haven of perpetual peace, 20 there rest from the eternity of toil that framed the fabric of thy perfectness.  'even time, the conqueror, fled thee in his fear; that hoary giant, who in lonely pride so long had ruled the world that nations fell beneath his silent footstep. pyramids, that for millenniums had withstood the tide of human things, his storm-breath drove in sand across that desert where their stones survived the name of him whose pride had heaped them there. 30 yon monarch, in his solitary pomp, was but the mushroom of a summer day, that his light-wingèd footstep pressed to dust; time was the king of earth; all things gave way before him but the fixed and virtuous will, the sacred sympathies of soul and sense, that mocked his fury and prepared his fall.  'yet slow and gradual dawned the morn of love; long lay the clouds of darkness o'er the scene, till from its native heaven they rolled away: 40 first, crime triumphant o'er all hope careered unblushing, undisguising, bold and strong, whilst falsehood, tricked in virtue's attributes, long sanctified all deeds of vice and woe, till, done by her own venomous sting to death, she left the moral world without a law, no longer fettering passion's fearless wing, nor searing reason with the brand of god. then steadily the happy ferment worked; reason was free; and wild though passion went 50 through tangled glens and wood-embosomed meads, gathering a garland of the strangest flowers, yet, like the bee returning to her queen, she bound the sweetest on her sister's brow, who meek and sober kissed the sportive child, no longer trembling at the broken rod.  'mild was the slow necessity of death. the tranquil spirit failed beneath its grasp, without a groan, almost without a fear, calm as a voyager to some distant land, 60 and full of wonder, full of hope as he. the deadly germs of languor and disease died in the human frame, and purity blessed with all gifts her earthly worshippers. how vigorous then the athletic form of age! how clear its open and unwrinkled brow! where neither avarice, cunning, pride or care had stamped the seal of gray deformity on all the mingling lineaments of time. how lovely the intrepid front of youth, 70 which meek-eyed courage decked with freshest grace; courage of soul, that dreaded not a name, and elevated will, that journeyed on through life's phantasmal scene in fearlessness, with virtue, love and pleasure, hand in hand!  'then, that sweet bondage which is freedom's self, and rivets with sensation's softest tie the kindred sympathies of human souls, needed no fetters of tyrannic law. those delicate and timid impulses 80 in nature's primal modesty arose, and with undoubting confidence disclosed the growing longings of its dawning love, unchecked by dull and selfish chastity, that virtue of the cheaply virtuous, who pride themselves in senselessness and frost. no longer prostitution's venomed bane poisoned the springs of happiness and life; woman and man, in confidence and love, equal and free and pure together trod 90 the mountain-paths of virtue, which no more were stained with blood from many a pilgrim's feet.  'then, where, through distant ages, long in pride the palace of the monarch-slave had mocked famine's faint groan and penury's silent tear, a heap of crumbling ruins stood, and threw year after year their stones upon the field, wakening a lonely echo; and the leaves of the old thorn, that on the topmost tower usurped the royal ensign's grandeur, shook 100 in the stern storm that swayed the topmost tower, and whispered strange tales in the whirlwind's ear.  'low through the lone cathedral's roofless aisles the melancholy winds a death-dirge sung. it were a sight of awfulness to see the works of faith and slavery, so vast, so sumptuous, yet so perishing withal, even as the corpse that rests beneath its wall! a thousand mourners deck the pomp of death to-day, the breathing marble glows above 110 to decorate its memory, and tongues are busy of its life; to-morrow, worms in silence and in darkness seize their prey.  'within the massy prison's mouldering courts, fearless and free the ruddy children played, weaving gay chaplets for their innocent brows with the green ivy and the red wall-flower that mock the dungeon's unavailing gloom; the ponderous chains and gratings of strong iron there rusted amid heaps of broken stone 120 that mingled slowly with their native earth; there the broad beam of day, which feebly once lighted the cheek of lean captivity with a pale and sickly glare, then freely shone on the pure smiles of infant playfulness; no more the shuddering voice of hoarse despair pealed through the echoing vaults, but soothing notes of ivy-fingered winds and gladsome birds and merriment were resonant around.  'these ruins soon left not a wreck behind; 130 their elements, wide-scattered o'er the globe, to happier shapes were moulded, and became ministrant to all blissful impulses; thus human things were perfected, and earth, even as a child beneath its mother's love, was strengthened in all excellence, and grew fairer and nobler with each passing year.  'now time his dusky pennons o'er the scene closes in steadfast darkness, and the past fades from our charmèd sight. my task is done; 140 thy lore is learned. earth's wonders are thine own with all the fear and all the hope they bring. my spells are passed; the present now recurs. ah me! a pathless wilderness remains yet unsubdued by man's reclaiming hand.  'yet, human spirit! bravely hold thy course; let virtue teach thee firmly to pursue the gradual paths of an aspiring change; for birth and life and death, and that strange state before the naked soul has found its home, 150 all tend to perfect happiness, and urge the restless wheels of being on their way, whose flashing spokes, instinct with infinite life, bicker and burn to gain their destined goal; for birth but wakes the spirit to the sense of outward shows, whose unexperienced shape new modes of passion to its frame may lend; life is its state of action, and the store of all events is aggregated there that variegate the eternal universe; 160 death is a gate of dreariness and gloom, that leads to azure isles and beaming skies and happy regions of eternal hope. therefore, o spirit! fearlessly bear on. though storms may break the primrose on its stalk, though frosts may blight the freshness of its bloom, yet spring's awakening breath will woo the earth to feed with kindliest dews its favorite flower, that blooms in mossy bank and darksome glens, lighting the greenwood with its sunny smile. 170  'fear not then, spirit, death's disrobing hand, so welcome when the tyrant is awake, so welcome when the bigot's hell-torch burns; 't is but the voyage of a darksome hour, the transient gulf-dream of a startling sleep. death is no foe to virtue; earth has seen love's brightest roses on the scaffold bloom, mingling with freedom's fadeless laurels there, and presaging the truth of visioned bliss. are there not hopes within thee, which this scene 180 of linked and gradual being has confirmed? whose stingings bade thy heart look further still, when, to the moonlight walk by henry led, sweetly and sadly thou didst talk of death? and wilt thou rudely tear them from thy breast, listening supinely to a bigot's creed, or tamely crouching to the tyrant's rod, whose iron thongs are red with human gore? never: but bravely bearing on, thy will is destined an eternal war to wage 190 with tyranny and falsehood, and uproot the germs of misery from the human heart. thine is the hand whose piety would soothe the thorny pillow of unhappy crime, whose impotence an easy pardon gains, watching its wanderings as a friend's disease; thine is the brow whose mildness would defy its fiercest rage, and brave its sternest will, when fenced by power and master of the world. thou art sincere and good; of resolute mind, 200 free from heart-withering custom's cold control, of passion lofty, pure and unsubdued. earth's pride and meanness could not vanquish thee, and therefore art thou worthy of the boon which thou hast now received; virtue shall keep thy footsteps in the path that thou hast trod, and many days of beaming hope shall bless thy spotless life of sweet and sacred love. go, happy one, and give that bosom joy, whose sleepless spirit waits to catch 210 light, life and rapture from thy smile!'  the fairy waves her wand of charm. speechless with bliss the spirit mounts the car, that rolled beside the battlement, bending her beamy eyes in thankfulness. again the enchanted steeds were yoked; again the burning wheels inflame the steep descent of heaven's untrodden way. fast and far the chariot flew; the vast and fiery globes that rolled 220 around the fairy's palace-gate lessened by slow degrees, and soon appeared such tiny twinklers as the planet orbs that there attendant on the solar power with borrowed light pursued their narrower way.  earth floated then below; the chariot paused a moment there; the spirit then descended; the restless coursers pawed the ungenial soil, snuffed the gross air, and then, their errand done, 230 unfurled their pinions to the winds of heaven.  the body and the soul united then. a gentle start convulsed ianthe's frame; her veiny eyelids quietly unclosed; moveless awhile the dark blue orbs remained. she looked around in wonder, and beheld henry, who kneeled in silence by her couch, watching her sleep with looks of speechless love, and the bright beaming stars that through the casement shone.

"the verdurins quarrel(chap. 2) lyrics                                             chapter two                    the verdurins quarrel with m. de charlus     after dinner, i told albertine that, since i was out of bed, i might as well take the opportunity to go and see some of my friends, mme. de villeparisis, mme. de guermantes, the cambremers, anyone in short whom i might find at home. i omitted to mention only the people whom i did intend to see, the verdurins. i asked her if she would not come with me. she pleaded that she had no suitable clothes. “besides, my hair is so awful. do you really wish me to go on doing it like this?” and by way of farewell she held out her hand to me in that abrupt fashion, the arm outstretched, the shoulders thrust back, which she used to adopt on the beach at balbec and had since then entirely abandoned. this forgotten gesture retransformed the body which it animated into that of the albertine who as yet scarcely knew me. it restored to albertine, ceremonious beneath an air of rudeness, her first novelty, her strangeness, even her setting. i saw the sea behind this girl whom i had never seen shake hands with me in this fashion since i was at the seaside. “my aunt thinks it makes me older,” she added with a sullen air. “oh that her aunt may be right!” thought i. “that albertine by looking like a child should make mme. bontemps appear younger than she is, is all that her aunt would ask, and also that albertine shall cost her nothing between now and the day when, by marrying me, she will repay what has been spent on her.” but that albertine should appear less young, less pretty, should turn fewer heads in the street, that is what i, on the contrary, hoped. for the age of a duenna is less reassuring to a jealous lover than the age of the woman’s face whom he loves. i regretted only that the style in which i had asked her to do her hair should appear to albertine an additional bolt on the door of her prison. and it was henceforward this new domestic sentiment that never ceased, even when i was parted from albertine, to form a bond attaching me to her     i said to albertine, who was not dressed, or so she told me, to accompany me to the guermantes’ or the cambremers’, that i could not be certain where i should go, and set off for the verdurins’. at the moment when the thought of the concert that i was going to hear brought back to my mind the scene that afternoon: “grand pied de grue, grand pied de grue,”— a scene of disappointed love, of jealous love perhaps, but if so as bestial as the scene to which a woman might be subjected by, so to speak, an orang-outang that was, if one may use the expression, in love with her — at the moment when, having reached the street, i was just going to hail a cab, i heard the sound of sobs which a man who was sitting upon a curbstone was endeavouring to stifle. i came nearer; the man, who had buried his face in his hands, appeared to be quite young, and i was surprised to see, from the gleam of white in the opening of his cloak, that he was wearing evening clothes and a white tie. as he heard my step he uncovered a face bathed in tears, but at once, having recognised me, turned away. it was morel. he guessed that i had recognised him and, checking his tears with an effort, told me that he had stopped to rest for a moment, he was in such pain. “i have grossly insulted, only to-day,” he said, “a person for whom i had the very highest regard. it was a cowardly thing to do, for she loves me.” “she will forget perhaps, as time goes on,” i replied, without realising that by speaking thus i made it apparent that i had overheard the scene that afternoon. but he was so much absorbed in his own grief that it never even occurred to him that i might know something about the affair. “she may forget, perhaps,” he said. “but i myself can never forget. i am too conscious of my degradation, i am disgusted with myself! however, what i have said i have said, and nothing can unsay it. when people make me lose my temper, i don’t know what i am doing. and it is so bad for me, my nerves are all on edge,” for, like all neurasthenics, he was keenly interested in his own health. if, during the afternoon, i had witnessed the amorous rage of an infuriated animal, this evening, within a few hours, centuries had elapsed and a fresh sentiment, a sentiment of shame, regret, grief, shewed that a great stage had been passed in the evolution of the beast destined to be transformed into a human being. nevertheless, i still heard ringing in my ears his ‘grand pied de grue‘ and dreaded an imminent return to the savage state. i had only a very vague impression, however, of what had been happening, and this was but natural, for m. de charlus himself was totally unaware that for some days past, and especially that day, even before the shameful episode which was not a direct consequence of the violinist’s condition, morel had been suffering from a recurrence of his neurasthenia. as a matter of fact, he had, in the previous month, proceeded as rapidly as he had been able, a great deal less rapidly than he would have liked, towards the seduction of jupien’s niece with whom he was at liberty, now that they were engaged, to go out whenever he chose. but whenever he had gone a trifle far in his attempts at violation, and especially when he suggested to his betrothed that she might make friends with other girls whom she would then procure for himself, he had met with a resistance that made him furious. all at once (whether she would have proved too chaste, or on the contrary would have surrendered herself) his desire had subsided. he had decided to break with her, but feeling that the baron, vicious as he might be, was far more moral than himself, he was afraid lest, in the event of a rupture, m. de charlus might turn him out of the house. and so he had decided, a fortnight ago, that he would not see the girl again, would leave m. de charlus and jupien to clean up the mess (he employed a more realistic term) by themselves, and, before announcing the rupture, to ‘b ——-off’ to an unknown destination     for all that his conduct towards jupien’s niece coincided exactly, in its minutest details, with the plan of conduct which he had outlined to the baron as they were dining together at saint-mars le vêtu, it is probable that his intention was entirely different, and that sentiments of a less atrocious nature, which he had not foreseen in his theory of conduct, had improved, had tinged it with sentiment in practice. the sole point in which, on the contrary, the practice was worse than the theory is this, that in theory it had not appeared to him possible that he could remain in paris after such an act of betrayal. now, on the contrary, actually to ‘b ——— off’ for so small a matter seemed to him quite unnecessary. it meant leaving the baron who would probably be furious, and forfeiting his own position. he would lose all the money that the baron was now giving him. the thought that this was inevitable made his nerves give away altogether, he cried for hours on end, and in order not to think about it any more dosed himself cautiously with morphine. then suddenly he hit upon an idea which no doubt had gradually been taking shape in his mind and gaining strength there for some time, and this was that a rupture with the girl would not inevitably mean a complete break with m. de charlus. to lose all the baron’s money was a serious thing in itself. morel in his uncertainty remained for some days a prey to dark thoughts, such as came to him at the sight of bloch. then he decided that jupien and his niece had been trying to set a trap for him, that they might consider themselves lucky to be rid of him so cheaply. he found in short that the girl had been in the wrong in being so clumsy, in not having managed to keep him attached to her by a sensual attraction. not only did the sacrifice of his position with m. de charlus seem to him absurd, he even regretted the expensive dinners he had given the girl since they became engaged, the exact cost of which he knew by heart, being a true son of the valet who used to bring his ‘book’ every month for my uncle’s inspection. for the word book, in the singular, which means a printed volume to humanity in general, loses that meaning among royal princes and servants. to the latter it means their housekeeping book, to the former the register in which we inscribe our names. (at balbec one day when the princesse de luxembourg told me that she had not brought a book with her, i was about to offer her le pêcheur d’islande and tartarîn de tarascon, when i realised that she had meant not that she would pass the time less agreeably, but that i should find it more difficult to pay a call upon her.)     notwithstanding the change in morel’s point of view with regard to the consequences of his behaviour, albeit that behaviour would have seemed to him abominable two months earlier, when he was passionately in love with jupien’s niece, whereas during the last fortnight he had never ceased to assure himself that the same behaviour was natural, praiseworthy, it continued to intensify the state of nervous unrest in which, finally, he had announced the rupture that afternoon. and he was quite prepared to vent his anger, if not (save in a momentary outburst) upon the girl, for whom he still felt that lingering fear, the last trace of love, at any rate upon the baron. he took care, however, not to say anything to him before dinner, for, valuing his own professional skill above everything, whenever he had any difficult music to play (as this evening at the verdurins’) he avoided (as far as possible, and the scene that afternoon was already more than ample) anything that might impair the flexibility of his wrists. similarly a surgeon who is an enthusiastic motorist, does not drive when he has an operation to perform. this accounts to me for the fact that, while he was speaking to me, he kept bending his fingers gently one after another to see whether they had regained their suppleness. a slight frown seemed to indicate that there was still a trace of nervous stiffness. but, so as not to increase it, he relaxed his features, as we forbid ourself to grow irritated at not being able to sleep or to prevail upon a woman, for fear lest our rage itself may retard the moment of sleep or of satisfaction. and so, anxious to regain his serenity so that he might, as was his habit, absorb himself entirely in what he was going to play at the verdurins’, and anxious, so long as i was watching him, to let me see how unhappy he was, he decided that the simplest course was to beg me to leave him immediately. his request was superfluous, and it was a relief to me to get away from him. i had trembled lest, as we were due at the same house, within a few minutes, he might ask me to take him with me, my memory of the scene that afternoon being too vivid not to give me a certain distaste for the idea of having morel by my side during the drive. it is quite possible that the love, and afterwards the indifference or hatred felt by morel for jupien’s niece had been sincere. unfortunately, it was not the first time that he had behaved thus, that he had suddenly ‘dropped’ a girl to whom he had sworn undying love, going so far as to produce a loaded revolver, telling her that he would blow out his brains if ever he was mean enough to desert her. he did nevertheless desert her in time, and felt instead of remorse, a sort of rancour against her. it was not the first time that he had behaved thus, it was not to be the last, with the result that the heads of many girls — girls less forgetful of him than he was of them — suffered — as jupien’s niece’s head continued long afterwards to suffer, still in love with morel although she despised him — suffered, ready to burst with the shooting of an internal pain because in each of them — like a fragment of a greek carving — an aspect of morel’s face, hard as marble and beautiful as an antique sculpture, was embedded in her brain, with his blossoming hair, his fine eyes, his straight nose, forming a protuberance in a cranium not shaped to receive it, upon which no operation was possible. but in the fulness of time these stony fragments end by slipping into a place where they cause no undue discomfort, from which they never stir again; we are no longer conscious of their presence: i mean forgetfulness, or an indifferent memory    meanwhile i had gained two things in the course of the day. on the one hand, thanks to the calm that was produced in me by albertine’s docility, i found it possible, and therefore made up my mind, to break with her. there was on the other hand, the fruit of my reflexions during the interval that i had spent waiting for her, at the piano, the idea that art, to which i would try to devote my reconquered liberty, was not a thing that justified one in making a sacrifice, a thing above and beyond life, that did not share in its fatuity and futility; the appearance of real individuality obtained in works of art being due merely to the illusion created by the artist’s technical skill. if my afternoon had left behind it other deposits, possibly more profound, they were not to come to my knowledge until much later. as for the two which i was able thus to weigh, they were not to be permanent; for, from this very evening my ideas about art were to rise above the depression to which they had been subjected in the afternoon, while on the other hand my calm, and consequently the freedom that would enable me to devote myself to it, was once again to be withdrawn from me     as my cab, following the line of the embankment, was coming near the verdurins’ house, i made the driver pull up. i had just seen brichot alighting from the tram at the foot of the rue bonaparte, after which he dusted his shoes with an old newspaper and put on a pair of pearl grey gloves. i went up to him on foot. for some time past, his sight having grown steadily weaker, he had been endowed — as richly as an observatory — with new spectacles of a powerful and complicated kind, which, like astronomical instruments, seemed to be screwed into his eyes; he focussed their exaggerated blaze upon myself and recognised me. they — the spectacles — were in marvellous condition. but behind them i could see, minute, pallid, convulsive, expiring, a remote gaze placed under this powerful apparatus, as, in a laboratory equipped out of all proportion to the work that is done in it, you may watch the last throes of some insignificant animalcule through the latest and most perfect type of microscope. i offered him my arm to guide him on his way. “this time it is not by great cherbourg that we meet,” he said to me, “but by little dunkerque,” a remark which i found extremely tiresome, as i failed to understand what he meant; and yet i dared not ask brichot, dreading not so much his scorn as his explanations. i replied that i was longing to see the room in which swann used to meet odette every evening. “what, so you know that old story, do you?” he said. “and yet from those days to the death of swann is what the poet rightly calls: ‘grande spatium mortalis aevi.’”     the death of swann had been a crushing blow to me at the time. the death of swann! swann, in this phrase, is something more than a noun in the possessive case. i mean by it his own particular death, the death allotted by destiny to the service of swann. for we talk of ‘death’ for convenience, but there are almost as many different deaths as there are people. we are not equipped with a sense that would enable us to see, moving at every speed in every direction, these deaths, the active deaths aimed by destiny at this person or that. often there are deaths that will not be entirely relieved of their duties until two or even three years later. they come in haste to plant a tumour in the side of a swann, then depart to attend to their other duties, returning only when, the surgeons having performed their operation, it is necessary to plant the tumour there afresh. then comes the moment when we read in the gaulois that swann’s health has been causing anxiety but that he is now making an excellent recovery. then, a few minutes before the breath leaves our body, death, like a sister of charity who has come to nurse, rather than to destroy us, enters to preside over our last moments, crowns with a supreme halo the cold and stiffening creature whose heart has ceased to beat. and it is this diversity among deaths, the mystery of their circuits, the colour of their fatal badge, that makes so impressive a paragraph in the newspapers such as this:      “we regret to learn that m. charles swann passed away yesterday at his residence in paris, after a long and painful illness. a parisian whose intellectual gifts were widely appreciated, a discriminating but steadfastly loyal friend, he will be universally regretted, in those literary and artistic circles where the soundness and refinement of his taste made him a willing and a welcome guest, as well as at the jockey club of which he was one of the oldest and most respected members. he belonged also to the union and agricole. he had recently resigned his membership of the rue royale. his personal appearance and eminently distinguished bearing never failed to arouse public interest at all the great events of the musical and artistic seasons, especially at private views, at which he was a regular attendant until, during the last years of his life, he became almost entirely confined to the house. the funeral will take place, etc.”     from this point of view, if one is not ‘somebody,’ the absence of a well known title makes the process of decomposition even more rapid. no doubt it is more or less anonymously, without any personal identity, that a man still remains duc d’uzès. but the ducal coronet does for some time hold the elements together, as their moulds keep together those artistically designed ices which albertine admired, whereas the names of ultra-fashionable commoners, as soon as they are dead, dissolve and lose their shape. we have seen m. de bréauté speak of cartier as the most intimate friend of the duc de la trémoïlle, as a man greatly in demand in aristocratic circles. to a later generation, cartier has become something so formless that it would almost be adding to his importance to make him out as related to the jeweller cartier, with whom he would have smiled to think that anybody could be so ignorant as to confuse him! swann on the contrary was a remarkable personality, in both the intellectual and the artistic worlds; and even although he had ‘produced’ nothing, still he had a chance of surviving a little longer. and yet, my dear charles ——-, whom i used to know when i was still so young and you were nearing your grave, it is because he whom you must have regarded as a little fool has made you the hero of one of his volumes that people are beginning to speak of you again and that your name will perhaps live. if in tissot’s picture representing the balcony of the rue royale club, where you figure with galliffet, edmond polignac and saint-maurice, people are always drawing attention to yourself, it is because they know that there are some traces of you in the character of swann     to return to more general realities, it was of this foretold and yet unforeseen death of swann that i had heard him speak himself to the duchesse de guermantes, on the evening of her cousin’s party. it was the same death whose striking and specific strangeness had recurred to me one evening when, as i ran my eye over the newspaper, my attention was suddenly arrested by the announcement of it, as though traced in mysterious lines interpolated there out of place. they had sufficed to make of a living man some one who can never again respond to what you say to him, to reduce him to a mere name, a written name, that has passed in a moment from the real world to the realm of silence. it was they that even now made me anxious to make myself familiar with the house in which the verdurins had lived, and where swann, who at that time was not merely a row of five letters printed in a newspaper, had dined so often with odette. i must add also (and this is what for a long time made swann’s death more painful than any other, albeit these reasons bore no relation to the individual strangeness of his death) that i had never gone to see gilberte, as i promised him at the princesse de guermantes’s, that he had never told me what the ‘other reason’ was, to which he alluded that evening, for his selecting me as the recipient of his conversation with the prince, that a thousand questions occurred to me (as bubbles rise from the bottom of a pond) which i longed to ask him about the most different subjects: vermeer, m. de mouchy, swann himself, a boucher tapestry, combray, questions that doubtless were not very vital since i had put off asking them from day to day, but which seemed to me of capital importance now that, his lips being sealed, no answer would ever come      “no,” brichot went on, “it was not here that swann met his future wife, or rather it was here only in the very latest period, after the disaster that partially destroyed mme. verdurin’s former home.”     unfortunately, in my fear of displaying before the eyes of brichot an extravagance which seemed to me out of place, since the professor had no share in its enjoyment, i had alighted too hastily from the carriage and the driver had not understood the words i had flung at him over my shoulder in order that i might be well clear of the carriage before brichot caught sight of me. the consequence was that the driver followed us and asked me whether he was to call for me later; i answered hurriedly in the affirmative, and was regarded with a vastly increased respect by the professor who had come by omnibus      “ah! so you were in a carriage,” he said in solemn tones. “only by the purest accident. i never take one as a rule. i always travel by omnibus or on foot. however, it may perhaps entitle me to the great honour of taking you home to-night if you will oblige me by consenting to enter that rattletrap; we shall be packed rather tight. but you are always so considerate to me.” alas, in making him this offer, i am depriving myself of nothing (i reflected) since in any case i shall be obliged to go home for albertine’s sake. her presence in my house, at an hour when nobody could possibly call to see her, allowed me to dispose as freely of my time as i had that afternoon, when, seated at the piano, i knew that she was on her way back from the trocadéro and that i was in no hurry to see her again. but furthermore, as also in the afternoon, i felt that i had a woman in the house and that on returning home i should not taste the fortifying thrill of solitude. “i accept with great good will,” replied brichot. “at the period to which you allude, our friends occupied in the rue montalivet a magnificent ground floor apartment with an upper landing, and a garden behind, less sumptuous of course, and yet to my mind preferable to the old venetian embassy.” brichot informed me that this evening there was to be at ‘quai conti’ (thus it was that the faithful spoke of the verdurin drawing-room since it had been transferred to that address) a great musical ‘tow-row-row’ got up by m. de charlus. he went on to say that in the old days to which i had referred, the little nucleus had been different, and its tone not at all the same, not only because the faithful had then been younger. he told me of elaborate jokes played by elstir (what he called ‘pure buffooneries’), as for instance one day when the painter, having pretended to fail at the last moment, had come disguised as an extra waiter and, as he handed round the dishes, whispered gallant speeches in the ear of the extremely proper baroness putbus, crimson with anger and alarm; then disappearing before the end of dinner he had had a hip-bath carried into the drawing-room, out of which, when the party left the table, he had emerged stark naked uttering fearful oaths; and also of supper parties to which the guests came in paper costumes, designed, cut out and coloured by elstir, which were masterpieces in themselves, brichot having worn on one occasion that of a great nobleman of the court of charles vii, with long turned-up points to his shoes, and another time that of napoleon i, for which elstir had fashioned a grand cordon of the legion of honour out of sealing-wax. in short brichot, seeing again with the eyes of memory the drawing-room of those days with its high windows, its low sofas devoured by the midday sun which had had to be replaced, declared that he preferred it to the drawing-room of to-day. of course, i quite understood that by ‘drawing-room’ brichot meant — as the word church implies not merely the religious edifice but the congregation of worshippers — not merely the apartment, but the people who visited it, the special pleasures that they came to enjoy there, to which, in his memory, those sofas had imparted their form upon which, when you called to see mme. verdurin in the afternoon, you waited until she was ready, while the blossom on the horse chestnuts outside, and on the mantelpiece carnations in vases seemed, with a charming and kindly thought for the visitor expressed in the smiling welcome of their rosy hues, to be watching anxiously for the tardy appearance of the lady of the house. but if the drawing-room seemed to him superior to what it was now, it was perhaps because our mind is the old proteus who cannot remain the slave of any one shape and, even in the social world, suddenly abandons a house which has slowly and with difficulty risen to the pitch of perfection to prefer another which is less brilliant, just as the ‘touched-up’ photographs which odette had had taken at otto’s, in which she queened it in a ‘princess’ gown, her hair waved by lenthéric, did not appeal to swann so much as a little ‘cabinet picture’ taken at nice, in which, in a cloth cape, her loosely dressed hair protruding beneath a straw hat trimmed with pansies and a bow of black ribbon, instead of being twenty years younger (for women as a rule look all the older in a photograph, the earlier it is), she looked like a little servant girl twenty years older than she now was. perhaps too he derived some pleasure from praising to me what i myself had never known, from shewing me that he had tasted delights that i could never enjoy. if so, he was successful, for merely by mentioning the names of two or three people who were no longer alive and to each of whom he imparted something mysterious by his way of referring to them, to that delicious intimacy, he made me ask myself what it could have been like; i felt that everything that had been told me about the verdurins was far too coarse; and indeed, in the case of swann whom i had known, i reproached myself with not having paid him sufficient attention, with not having paid attention to him in a sufficiently disinterested spirit, with not having listened to him properly when he used to entertain me while we waited for his wife to come home for luncheon and he shewed me his treasures, now that i knew that he was to be classed with the most brilliant talkers of the past. just as we were coming to mme. verdurin’s doorstep, i caught sight of m. de charlus, steering towards us the bulk of his huge body, drawing unwillingly in his wake one of those blackmailers or mendicants who nowadays, whenever he appeared, sprang up without fail even in what were to all appearance the most deserted corners, by whom this powerful monster was, evidently against his will, invariably escorted, although at a certain distance, as is the shark by its pilot, in short contrasting so markedly with the haughty stranger of my first visit to balbec, with his stern aspect, his affectation of virility, that i seemed to be discovering, accompanied by its satellite, a planet at a wholly different period of its revolution, when one begins to see it full, or a sick man now devoured by the malady which a few years ago was but a tiny spot which was easily concealed and the gravity of which was never suspected. although the operation that brichot had undergone had restored a tiny portion of the sight which he had thought to be lost for ever, i do not think he had observed the ruffian following in the baron’s steps. not that this mattered, for, ever since la raspelière, and notwithstanding the professor’s friendly regard for m. de charlus, the sight of the latter always made him feel ill at ease. no doubt to every man the life of every other extends along shadowy paths which he does not suspect. falsehood, however, so often treacherous, upon which all conversation is based, conceals less perfectly a feeling of hostility, or of sordid interest, or a visit which we wish to look as though we had not paid, or an escapade with the mistress of a day which we are anxious to keep from our wife, than a good reputation covers up — so as not to let their existence be guessed — evil habits. they may remain unknown to us for a lifetime; an accidental encounter upon a pier, at night, will disclose them; even then this accidental discovery is frequently misunderstood and we require a third person, who is in the secret, to supply the unimaginable clue of which everyone is unaware. but, once we know about them, they alarm us because we feel that that way madness lies, far more than by their immorality. mme. de surgis did not possess the slightest trace of any moral feeling, and would have admitted anything of her sons that could be degraded and explained by material interest, which is comprehensible to all mankind! but she forbade them to go on visiting m. de charlus when she learned that, by a sort of internal clockwork, he was inevitably drawn upon each of their visits, to pinch their chins and to make each of them pinch his brother’s. she felt that uneasy sense of a physical mystery which makes us ask ourself whether the neighbour with whom we have been on friendly terms is not tainted with cannibalism, and to the baron’s repeated inquiry: “when am i going to see your sons again?” she would reply, conscious of the thunderbolts that she was attracting to her defenceless head, that they were very busy working for examinations, preparing to go abroad, and so forth. irresponsibility aggravates faults, and even crimes, whatever anyone may say. landru (assuming that he really did kill his wives) if he did so from a financial motive, which it is possible to resist, may be pardoned, but not if his crime was due to an irresistible sadism     brichot’s coarse pleasantries, in the early days of his friendship with the baron, had given place, as soon as it was a question, not of uttering commonplaces, but of understanding, to an awkward feeling which concealed a certain merriment. he reassured himself by recalling pages of plato, lines of virgil, because, being mentally as well as physically blind, he did not understand that in those days to fall in love with a young man was like, in our day (socrates’s jokes reveal this more clearly than plato’s theories), keeping a dancing girl before one marries and settles down. m. de charlus himself would not have understood, he who confused his mania with friendship, which does not resemble it in the least, and the athletes of praxiteles with obliging boxers. he refused to see that for the last nineteen hundred years (“a pious courtier under a pious prince would have been an atheist under an atheist prince,” as labruyère reminds us) all conventional homosexuality — that of plato’s young friends as well as that of virgil’s shepherds — has disappeared, that what survives and increases is only the involuntary, the neurotic kind, which we conceal from other people and disguise to ourselves. and m. de charlus would have been wrong in not denying frankly the pagan genealogy. in exchange for a little plastic beauty, how vast the moral superiority! the shepherd in theocritus who sighs for love of a boy, later on will have no reason to be less hard of heart, less dull of wit than the other shepherd whose flute sounds for amaryllis. for the former is not suffering from a malady, he is conforming to the customs of his time. it is the homosexuality that survives in spite of obstacles, a thing of scorn and loathing, that is the only true form, the only form that can be found conjoined in a person with an enhancement of his moral qualities. we are appalled at the apparently close relation between these and our bodily attributes, when we think of the slight dislocation of a purely physical taste, the slight blemish in one of the senses, which explain why the world of poets and musicians, so firmly barred against the duc de guermantes, opens its portals to m. de charlus. that the latter should shew taste in the furnishing of his home, which is that of an eclectic housewife, need not surprise us; but the narrow loophole that opens upon beethoven and veronese! this does not exempt the sane from a feeling of alarm when a madman who has composed a sublime poem, after explaining to them in the most logical fashion that he has been shut up by mistake, through his wife’s machinations, imploring them to intercede for him with the governor of the asylum, complaining of the promiscuous company that is forced upon him, concludes as follows: “you see that man who is waiting to speak to me on the lawn, whom i am obliged to put up with; he thinks that he is jesus christ. that alone will shew you the sort of lunatics that i have to live among; he cannot be christ, for i am christ myself!” a moment earlier, you were on the point of going to assure the governor that a mistake had been made. at this final speech, even if you bear in mind the admirable poem at which this same man is working every day, you shrink from him, as mme. de surgis’s sons shrank from m. de charlus, not that he would have done them any harm, but because of his ceaseless invitations, the ultimate purpose of which was to pinch their chins. the poet is to be pitied, who must, with no virgil to guide him, pass through the circles of an inferno of sulphur and brimstone, to cast himself into the fire that falls from heaven, in order to rescue a few of the inhabitants of sodom! no charm in his work; the same severity in his life as in those of the unfrocked priests who follow the strictest rule of celibacy so that no one may be able to ascribe to anything but loss of faith their discarding of the cassock     making a pretence of not seeing the seedy individual who was following in his wake (whenever the baron ventured into the boulevards or crossed the waiting-room in saint-lazarre station, these followers might be counted by the dozen who, in the hope of ‘touching him for a dollar,’ never let him out of their sight), and afraid at the same time that the other might have the audacity to accost him, the baron had devoutly lowered his darkened eyelids which, in contrast to his rice-powdered cheeks, gave him the appearance of a grand inquisitor painted by el greco. but this priestly expression caused alarm, and he looked like an unfrocked priest, various compromises to which he had been driven by the need to apologise for his taste and to keep it secret having had the effect of bringing to the surface of his face precisely what the baron sought to conceal, a debauched life indicated by moral decay. this last, indeed, whatever be its cause, is easily detected, for it is never slow in taking bodily form and proliferates upon a face, especially on the cheeks and round the eyes, as physically as the ochreous yellows accumulate there in a case of jaundice or repulsive reds in a case of skin disease. nor was it merely in the cheeks, or rather the chaps of this painted face, in the mammiferous chest, the aggressive rump of this body allowed to deteriorate and invaded by obesity, upon which there now floated iridescent as a film of oil, the vice at one time so jealously confined by m. de charlus in the most secret chamber of his heart. now it overflowed in all his speech      “so this is how you prowl the streets at night, brichot, with a good-looking young man,” he said as he joined us, while the disappointed ruffian made off. “a fine example. we must tell your young pupils at the sorbonne that this is how you behave. but, i must say, the society of youth seems to be good for you, monsieur le professeur, you are as fresh as a rosebud. i have interrupted you, you looked as though you were enjoying yourselves like a pair of giddy girls, and had no need of an old granny killjoy like myself. i shan’t take it to the confessional, since you are almost at your destination.” the baron’s mood was all the more blithe since he knew nothing whatever about the scene that afternoon, jupien having decided that it was better to protect his niece against a repetition of the onslaught than to inform m. de charlus. and so the baron was still looking forward to the marriage, and delighting in the thought of it. one would suppose that it is a consolation to these great solitaries to give their tragic celibacy the relief of a fictitious fatherhood. “but, upon my word, brichot,” he went on, turning with a laugh to gaze at us, “i feel quite awkward when i see you in such gallant company. you were like a pair of lovers. going along arm in arm, i say, brichot, you do go the pace!” ought one to ascribe this speech to the senility of a particular state of mind, less capable than in the past of controlling its reflexes, which in moments of automatism lets out a secret that has been so carefully hidden for forty years? or rather to that contempt for plebeian opinion which all the guermantes felt in their hearts, and of which m. de charlus’s brother, the duke, was displaying a variant form when, regardless of the fact that my mother could see him, he used to shave standing by his bedroom window in his unbuttoned nightshirt. had m. de charlus contracted, during the roasting journeys between doncières and douville, the dangerous habit of making himself at ease, and, just as he would push back his straw hat in order to cool his huge forehead, of unfastening — at first, for a few moments only — the mask that for too long had been rigorously imposed upon his true face? his conjugal attitude towards morel might well have astonished anyone who had observed it in its full extent. but m. de charlus had reached the stage when the monotony of the pleasures that his vice has to offer became wearying. he had sought instinctively for novel displays, and, growing tired of the strangers whom he picked up, had passed to the opposite pole, to what he used to imagine that he would always loathe, the imitation of family life, or of fatherhood. sometimes even this did not suffice him, he required novelty, and would go and spend the night with a woman, just as a normal man may, once in his life, have wished to go to bed with a boy, from a curiosity similar though inverse, and in either case equally unhealthy. the baron’s existence as one of the ‘faithful,’ living, for charlie’s sake, entirely among the little clan, had had, in stultifying the efforts that he had been making for years to keep up lying appearances, the same influence that a voyage of exploration or residence in the colonies has upon certain europeans who discard the ruling principles by which they were guided at home. and yet, the internal revolution of a mind, ignorant at first of the anomaly contained in its body, then appalled at it after the discovery, and finally growing so used to it as to fail to perceive that it is not safe to confess to other people what the sinner has come in time to confess without shame to himself, had been even more effective in liberating m. de charlus from the last vestiges of social constraint than the time that he spent at the verdurins’. no banishment, indeed, to the south pole, or to the summit of mont blanc, can separate us so entirely from our fellow creatures as a prolonged residence in the seclusion of a secret vice, that is to say of a state of mind that is different from theirs. a vice (so m. de charlus used at one time to style it) to which the baron now gave the genial aspect of a mere failing, extremely common, attractive on the whole and almost amusing, like laziness, absent-mindedness or greed. conscious of the curiosity that his own striking personality aroused, m. de charlus derived a certain pleasure from satisfying, whetting, sustaining it. just as a jewish journalist will come forward day after day as the champion of catholicism, not, probably, with any hope of being taken seriously, but simply in order not to disappoint the good-natured amusement of his readers, m. de charlus would genially denounce evil habits among the little clan, as he would have mimicked a person speaking english or imitated mounet-sully, without waiting to be asked, so as to pay his scot with a good grace, by displaying an amateur talent in society; so that m. de charlus now threatened brichot that he would report to the sorbonne that he was in the habit of walking about with young men, exactly as the circumcised scribe keeps referring in and out of season to the ‘eldest daughter of the church’ and the ‘sacred heart of jesus,’ that is to say without the least trace of hypocrisy, but with a distinctly histrionic effect. it was not only the change in the words themselves, so different from those that he allowed himself to use in the past, that seemed to require some explanation, there was also the change that had occurred in his intonations, his gestures, all of which now singularly resembled the type m. de charlus used most fiercely to castigate; he would now utter unconsciously almost the same little cries (unconscious in him, and all the more deep-rooted) as are uttered consciously by the inverts who refer to one another as ‘she’; as though this deliberate ‘camping,’ against which m. de charlus had for so long set his face, were after all merely a brilliant and faithful imitation of the manner that men of the charlus type, whatever they may say, are compelled to adopt when they have reached a certain stage in their malady, just as sufferers from general paralysis or locomotor ataxia inevitably end by displaying certain symptoms. as a matter of fact — and this is what this purely unconscious ‘camping’ revealed — the difference between the stern charlus, dressed all in black, with his stiffly brushed hair, whom i had known, and the painted young men, loaded with rings, was no more than the purely imaginary difference that exists between an excited person who talks fast, keeps moving all the time, and a neurotic who talks slowly, preserves a perpetual phlegm, but is tainted with the same neurasthenia in the eyes of the physician who knows that each of the two is devoured by the same anguish and marred by the same defects. at the same time one could tell that m. de charlus had aged from wholly different signs, such as the extraordinary frequency in his conversation of certain expressions that had taken root in it and used now to crop up at every moment (for instance: ‘the chain of circumstances’) upon which the baron’s speech leaned in sentence after sentence as upon a necessary prop. “is charlie here yet?” brichot asked m. de charlus as we came in sight of the door. “oh, i don’t know,” said the baron, raising his arms and half-shutting his eyes with the air of a person who does not wish anyone to accuse him of being indiscreet, all the more so as he had probably been reproached by morel for things which he had said and which the other, as timorous as he was vain, and as ready to deny m. de charlus as he was to boast of his friendship, had considered serious albeit they were quite unimportant. “you know, he never tells me what he’s going to do.” if the conversations of two people bound by a tie of intimacy are full of falsehood, this occurs no less spontaneously in the conversations that a third person holds with a lover on the subject of the person with whom the latter is in love, whatever be the sex of that person      “have you seen him lately?” i asked m. de charlus, with the object of seeming at once not to be afraid of mentioning morel to him and not to believe that they were actually living together. “he came in, as it happened, for five minutes this morning while i was still half asleep, and sat down on the side of my bed, as though he wanted to ravish me.” i guessed at once that m. de charlus had seen charlie within the last hour, for if we ask a woman when she last saw the man whom we know to be — and whom she may perhaps suppose that we suspect of being — her lover, if she has just taken tea with him, she replies: “i saw him for an instant before luncheon.” between these two incidents the only difference is that one is false and the other true, but both are equally innocent, or, if you prefer it, equally culpable. and so we should be unable to understand why the mistress (in this case, m. de charlus) always chooses the false version, did we not know that such replies are determined, unknown to the person who utters them, by a number of factors which appear so out of proportion to the triviality of the incident that we do not take the trouble to consider them. but to a physicist the space occupied by the tiniest ball of pith is explained by the harmony of action, the conflict or equilibrium, of laws of attraction or repulsion which govern far greater worlds. just as many different laws acting in opposite directions dictate the more general responses with regard to the innocence, the ‘platonism,’ or on the contrary the carnal reality of the relations that one has with the person whom one says one saw in the morning when one has seen him or her in the evening. here we need merely record, without pausing to consider them, the desire to appear natural and fearless, the instinctive impulse to conceal a secret assignation, a blend of modesty and ostentation, the need to confess what one finds so delightful and to shew that one is loved, a divination of what the other person knows or guesses — but does not say — a divination which, exceeding or falling short of the other person’s, makes one now exaggerate, now under-estimate it, the spontaneous longing to play with fire and the determination to rescue something from the blaze. at the same time, speaking generally, let us say that m. de charlus, notwithstanding the aggravation of his malady which perpetually urged him to reveal, to insinuate, sometimes boldly to invent compromising details, did intend, during this period in his life, to make it known that charlie was not a man of the same sort as himself and that they were friends and nothing more. this did not prevent him (even though it may quite possibly have been true) from contradicting himself at times (as with regard to the hour at which they had last met), whether he forgot himself at such moments and told the truth, or invented a lie, boastingly or from a sentimental affectation or because he thought it amusing to baffle his questioner. “you know that he is to me,” the baron went on, “the best of comrades, for whom i have the greatest affection, as i am certain” (was he uncertain of it, then, that he felt the need to say that he was certain?) “he has for me, but there is nothing at all between us, nothing of that sort, you understand, nothing of that sort,” said the baron, as naturally as though he had been speaking of a woman. “yes, he came in this morning to pull me out of bed. though he knows that i hate anybody to    it is possible that the baron was in earnest when he spoke of morel as a good comrade, and that he was being even more truthful than he supposed when he said: “i never know what he’s doing; he tells me nothing about his life.”     indeed we may mention (interrupting for a few moments our narrative, which shall be resumed immediately after the closure of this parenthesis which opens at the moment when m. de charlus, brichot and myself are arriving at mme. verdurin’s front door), we may mention that shortly before this evening the baron had been plunged in grief and stupefaction by a letter which he had opened by mistake and which was addressed to morel. this letter, which by a repercussion was to cause intense misery to myself also, was written by the actress léa, notorious for her exclusive interest in women. and yet her letter to morel (whom m. de charlus had never suspected of knowing her, even) was written in the most impassioned tone. its indelicacy prevents us from reproducing it here, but we may mention that léa addressed him throughout in the feminine gender, with such expressions as: “go on, you bad woman!” or “of course you are so, my pretty, you know you are.” and in this letter reference was made to various other women who seemed to be no less morel’s friends than léa’s. on the other hand, morel’s sarcasm at the baron’s expense and léa’s at that of an officer who was keeping her, and of whom she said: “he keeps writing me letters begging me to be careful! what do you say to that, my little white puss,” revealed to m. de charlus a state of things no less unsuspected by him than were morel’s peculiar and intimate relations with léa. what most disturbed the baron was the word ‘so.’ ignorant at first of its application, he had eventually, at a time already remote in the past, learned that he himself was ‘so.’ and now the notion that he had acquired of this word was again put to the challenge. when he had discovered that he was ‘so,’ he had supposed this to mean that his tastes, as saint-simon says, did not lie in the direction of women. and here was this word ‘so’ applied to morel with an extension of meaning of which m. de charlus was unaware, so much so that morel gave proof, according to this letter, of his being ‘so’ by having the same taste as certain women for other women. from that moment the baron’s jealousy had no longer any reason to confine itself to the men of morel’s acquaintance, but began to extend to the women also. so that the people who were ‘so’ were not merely those that he had supposed to be ‘so,’ but a whole and vast section of the inhabitants of the planet, consisting of women as well as of men, loving not merely men but women also, and the baron, in the face of this novel meaning of a word that was so familiar to him, felt himself tormented by an anxiety of the mind as well as of the heart, born of this twofold mystery which combined an extension of the field of his jealousy with the sudden inadequacy of a definition     m. de charlus had never in his life been anything but an amateur. that is to say, incidents of this sort could never be of any use to him. he worked off the painful impression that they might make upon him in violent scenes in which he was a past-master of eloquence, or in crafty intrigues. but to a person endowed with the qualities of a bergotte, for instance, they might have been of inestimable value. this may indeed explain, to a certain extent (since we have to grope blindfold, but choose, like the lower animals, the herb that is good for us), why men like bergotte have generally lived in the company of persons who were ordinary, false and malicious. their beauty is sufficient for the writer’s imagination, enhances his generosity, but does not in any way alter the nature of his companion, whose life, situated thousands of feet below the level of his own, her incredible stories, her lies carried farther, and, what is more, in another direction than what might have been expected, appear in occasional flashes. the lie, the perfect lie, about people whom we know, about the relations that we have had with them, about our motive for some action, a motive which we express in totally different terms, the lie as to what we are, whom we love, what we feel with regard to the person who loves us and believes that she has fashioned us in her own image because she keeps on kissing us morning, noon and night, that lie is one of the only things in the world that can open a window for us upon what is novel, unknown, that can awaken in us sleeping senses to the contemplation of universes that otherwise we should never have known. we are bound to say, in so far as m. de charlus is concerned, that, if he was stupefied to learn with regard to morel a certain number of things which the latter had carefully concealed from him, he was not justified in concluding from this that it was a mistake to associate too closely with the lower orders. we shall indeed see, in the concluding section of this work, m. de charlus himself engaged in doing things which would have stupefied the members of his family and his friends far more than he could possibly have been stupefied by the revelations of léa. (the revelation that he had found most painful had been that of a tour which morel had made with léa, whereas at the time he had assured m. de charlus that he was studying music in germany. he had found support for this falsehood in obliging friends in germany to whom he had sent his letters, to be forwarded from there to m. de charlus, who, as it happened, was so positive that morel was there that he had not even looked at the postmark.) but it is time to rejoin the baron as he advances with brichot and myself towards the verdurins’ door      “and what,” he went on, turning to myself, “has become of your young hebrew friend, whom we met at douville? it occurred to me that, if you liked, one might perhaps invite him to the house one evening.” for m. de charlus, who did not shrink from employing a private detective to spy upon every word and action of morel, for all the world like a husband or a lover, had not ceased to pay attention to other young men. the vigilance which he made one of his old servants maintain, through an agency, upon morel, was so indiscreet that his footmen thought they were being watched, and one of the housemaids could not endure the suspense, never ventured into the street, always expecting to find a policeman at her heels. “she can do whatever she likes! it would be a waste of time and money to follow her! as if her goings on mattered to us!” the old servant ironically exclaimed, for he was so passionately devoted to his master that, albeit he in no way shared the baron’s tastes, he had come in time, with such ardour did he employ himself in their service, to speak of them as though they were his own. “he is the very best of good fellows,” m. de charlus would say of this old servant, for we never appreciate anyone so much as those who combine with other great virtues that of placing themselves unconditionally at the disposal of our vices. it was moreover of men alone that m. de charlus was capable of feeling any jealousy so far as morel was concerned. women inspired in him no jealousy whatever. this is indeed an almost universal rule with the charlus type. the love of the man with whom they are in love for women is something different, which occurs in another animal species (a lion does not interfere with tigers); does not distress them; if anything, reassures them. sometimes, it is true, in the case of those who exalt their inversion to the level of a priesthood, this love creates disgust. these men resent their friends’ having succumbed to it, not as a betrayal but as a lapse from virtue. a charlus, of a different variety from the baron, would have been as indignant at the discovery of morel’s relations with a woman as upon reading in a newspaper that he, the interpreter of bach and handel, was going to play puccini. it is, by the way, for this reason that the young men who, with an eye to their own personal advantage, condescend to the love of men like charlus, assure them that women inspire them only with disgust, just as they would tell a doctor that they never touch alcohol, and care only for spring water. but m. de charlus, in this respect, departed to some extent from the general rule. since he admired everything about morel, the latter’s successes with women caused him no annoyance, gave him the same joy as his successes on the platform, or at écarté. “but do you know, my dear fellow, he has women,” he would say, with an air of disclosure, of scandal, possibly of envy, above all of admiration. “he is extraordinary,” he would continue. “everywhere, the most famous whores can look at nobody but him. they stare at him everywhere, whether, it’s on the underground or in the theatre. it’s becoming a nuisance! i can’t go out with him to a restaurant without the waiter bringing him notes from at least three women. and always pretty women too. not that there’s anything surprising in that. i was watching him yesterday, i can quite understand it, he has become so beautiful, he looks just like a bronzino, he is really marvellous.” but m. de charlus liked to shew that he was in love with morel, to persuade other people, possibly to persuade himself, that morel was in love with him. he applied to the purpose of having morel always with him (notwithstanding the harm that the young fellow might do to the baron’s social position) a sort of self-esteem. for (and this is frequent among men of good position, who are snobs, and, in their vanity, sever all their social ties in order to be seen everywhere with a mistress, a person of doubtful or a lady of tarnished reputation, whom nobody will invite, and with whom nevertheless it seems to them flattering to be associated) he had arrived at that stage at which self-esteem devotes all its energy to destroying the goals to which it has attained, whether because, under the influence of love, a man finds a prestige which he is alone in perceiving in ostentatious relations with the beloved object, or because, by the waning of social ambitions that have been gratified, and the rising of a tide of subsidiary curiosities all the more absorbing the more platonic they are, the latter have not only reached but have passed the level at which the former found it difficult to remain     as for young men in general, m. de charlus found that to his fondness for them morel’s existence was not an obstacle, and that indeed his brilliant reputation as a violinist or his growing fame as a composer and journalist might in certain instances prove an attraction. did anyone introduce to the baron a young composer of an agreeable type, it was in morel’s talents that he sought an opportunity of doing the stranger a favour. “you must,” he would tell him, “bring me some of your work so that morel can play it at a concert or on tour. there is hardly any decent music written, now, for the violin. it is a godsend to find anything new. and abroad they appreciate that sort of thing enormously. even in the provinces there are little musical societies where they love music with a fervour and intelligence that are quite admirable.” without any greater sincerity (for all this could serve only as a bait and it was seldom that morel condescended to fulfil these promises), bloch having confessed that he was something of a poet (when he was ‘in the mood,’ he had added with the sarcastic laugh with which he would accompany a platitude, when he could think of nothing original), m. de charlus said to me: “you must tell your young israelite, since he writes verses, that he must really bring me some for morel. for a composer, that is always the stumbling block, to find something decent to set to music. one might even consider a libretto. it would not be without interest, and would acquire a certain value from the distinction of the poet, from my patronage, from a whole chain of auxiliary circumstances, among which morel’s talent would take the chief place, for he is composing a lot just now, and writing too, and very pleasantly, i must talk to you about it. as for his talent as a performer (there, as you know, he is already a past-master), you shall see this evening how well the lad plays vinteuil’s music; he overwhelms me; at his age, to have such an understanding while he is still such a boy, such a kid! oh, this evening is only to be a little rehearsal. the big affair is to come off in two or three days. but it will be much more distinguished this evening. and so we are delighted that you have come,” he went on, employing the plural pronoun doubtless because a king says: “it is our wish.” “the programme is so magnificent that i have advised mme. verdurin to give two parties. one in a few days’ time, at which she will have all her own friends, the other to-night at which the hostess is, to use a legal expression, ‘disseized.’ it is i who have issued the invitations, and i have collected a few people from another sphere, who may be useful to charlie, and whom it will be nice for the verdurins to meet. don’t you agree, it is all very well to have the finest music played by the greatest artists, the effect of the performance remains muffled in cotton-wool, if the audience is composed of the milliner from across the way and the grocer from round the corner. you know what i think of the intellectual level of people in society, still they can play certain quite important parts, among others that which in public events devolves upon the press, and which is that of being an organ of publicity. you know what i mean; i have for instance invited my sister-in-law oriane; it is not certain that she will come, but it is on the other hand certain that, if she does come, she will understand absolutely nothing. but one does not ask her to understand, which is beyond her capacity, but to talk, a task which is admirably suited to her, and which she never fails to perform. what is the result? to-morrow as ever is, instead of the silence of the milliner and the grocer, an animated conversation at the mortemarts’ with oriane telling everyone that she has heard the most marvellous music, that a certain morel, and so forth; unspeakable rage of the people not invited, who will say: ‘palamède thought, no doubt, that we were unworthy; anyhow, who are these people who were giving the party?’ a counterblast quite as useful as oriane’s praises, because morel’s name keeps cropping up all the time and is finally engraved in the memory like a lesson that one has read over a dozen times. all this forms a chain of circumstances which may be of value to the artist, to the hostess, may serve as a sort of megaphone for a performance which will thus be made audible to a remote public. really, it is worth the trouble; you shall see what progress charlie has made. and what is more, we have discovered a new talent in him, my dear fellow, he writes like an angel. like an angel, i tell you.” m. de charlus omitted to say that for some time past he had been employing morel, like those great noblemen of the seventeenth century who scorned to sign and even to write their own slanderous attacks, to compose certain vilely calumnious little paragraphs at the expense of comtesse mole. their insolence apparent even to those who merely glanced at them, how much more cruel were they to the young woman herself, who found in them, so skilfully introduced that nobody but herself saw the point, certain passages from her own correspondence, textually quoted, but interpreted in a sense which made them as deadly as the cruellest revenge. they killed the lady. but there is edited every day in paris, balzac would tell us, a sort of spoken newspaper, more terrible than its printed rivals. we shall see later on that this verbal press reduced to nothing the power of a charlus who had fallen out of fashion, and exalted far above him a morel who was not worth the millionth part of his former patron. is this intellectual fashion really so simple, and does it sincerely believe in the nullity of a charlus of genius, in the incontestable authority of a crass morel? the baron was not so innocent in his implacable vengeance. whence, no doubt, that bitter venom on his tongue, the spreading of which seemed to dye his cheeks with jaundice when he was in a rage. “you who knew bergotte,” m. de charlus went on, “i thought at one time that you might, perhaps, by refreshing his memory with regard to the youngster’s writings, collaborate in short with myself, help me to assist a twofold talent, that of a musician and a writer, which may one day acquire the prestige of that of berlioz. as you know, the illustrious have often other things to think about, they are smothered in flattery, they take little interest except in themselves. but bergotte, who was genuinely unpretentious and obliging, promised me that he would get into the gaulois, or some such paper, those little articles, a blend of the humourist and the musician, which he really does quite charmingly now, and i am really very glad that charlie should combine with his violin this little stroke of ingres’s pen. i know that i am prone to exaggeration, when he is concerned, like all the old fairy godmothers of the conservatoire. what, my dear fellow, didn’t you know that? you have never observed my little weakness. i pace up and down for hours on end outside the examination hall. i’m as happy as a queen. as for charlie’s prose, bergotte assured me that it was really very good indeed.”     m. de charlus, who had long been acquainted with bergotte through swann, had indeed gone to see him a few days before his death, to ask him to find an opening for morel in some newspaper for a sort of commentary, half humorous, upon the music of the day. in doing so, m. de charlus had felt some remorse, for, himself a great admirer of bergotte, he was conscious that he never went to see him for his own sake, but in order, thanks to the respect, partly intellectual, partly social, that bergotte felt for him, to be able to do a great service to morel, or to some other of his friends. that he no longer made use of people in society for any other purpose did not shock m. de charlus, but to treat bergotte thus had appeared to him more offensive, for he felt that bergotte had not the calculating nature of people in society, and deserved better treatment. only, his was a busy life, and he could never find time for anything except when he was greatly interested in something, when, for instance, it affected morel. what was more, as he was himself extremely intelligent, the conversation of an intelligent man left him comparatively cold, especially that of bergotte who was too much the man of letters for his liking and belonged to another clan, did not share his point of view. as for bergotte, he had observed the calculated motive of m. de charlus’s visits, but had felt no resentment, for he had been incapable, throughout his life, of any consecutive generosity, but anxious to give pleasure, broadminded, insensitive to the pleasure of administering a rebuke. as for m. de charlus’s vice, he had never partaken of it to the smallest extent, but had found in it rather an element of colour in the person affected, fas et nefas, for an artist, consisting not in moral examples but in memories of plato or of sodom. “but you, fair youth, we never see you at quai conti. you don’t abuse their hospitality!” i explained that i went out as a rule with my cousin. “do you hear that! he goes out with his cousin! what a most particularly pure young man!” said m. de charlus to brichot. then, turning again to myself: “but we are not asking you to give an account of your life, my boy. you are free to do anything that amuses you. we merely regret that we have no share in it. besides, you shew very good taste, your cousin is charming, ask brichot, she quite turned his head at douville. we shall regret her absence this evening. but you did just as well, perhaps, not to bring her with you. vinteuil’s music is delightful. but i have heard that we are to meet the composer’s daughter and her friend, who have a terrible reputation. that sort of thing is always awkward for a girl. they are sure to be there, unless the ladies have been detained in the country, for they were to have been present without fail all afternoon at a rehearsal which mme. verdurin was giving to-day, to which she had invited only the bores, her family, the people whom she could not very well have this evening. but a moment ago, before dinner, charlie told us that the sisters vinteuil. as we call them, for whom they were all waiting, never came.” notwithstanding the intense pain that i had felt at the sudden association with its effect, of which alone i had been aware, of the cause, at length discovered, of albertine’s anxiety to be there that afternoon, the presence publicly announced (but of which i had been ignorant) of mlle. vinteuil and her friend, my mind was still sufficiently detached to remark that m. de charlus, who had told us, a few minutes earlier, that he had not seen charlie since the morning, was now brazenly admitting that he had seen him before dinner. my pain became visible. “why, what is the matter with you?” said the baron. “you are quite green; come, let us go in, you will catch cold, you don’t look at all well.” it was not any doubt as to albertine’s virtue that m. de charlus’s words had awakened in me. many other doubts had penetrated my mind already; at each fresh doubt we feel that the measure is heaped full, that we cannot cope with it, then we manage to find room for it all the same, and once it is introduced into our vital essence it enters into competition there with so many longings to believe, so many reasons to forget, that we speedily become accustomed to it, and end by ceasing to pay it any attention. there remains only, like a partly healed pain, the menace of possible suffering, which, the counterpart of desire, a feeling of the same order, and like it become the centre of our thoughts, radiates through them to an infinite circumference a wistful melancholy, as desire radiates pleasures whose origin we fail to perceive, wherever anything may suggest the idea of the person with whom we are in love. but pain revives as soon as a fresh doubt enters our mind complete; even if we assure ourself almost immediately: “i shall deal with this, there must be some method by which i need not suffer, it cannot be true,” nevertheless there has been a first moment in which we suffered as though we believed it. if we had merely members, such as legs and arms, life would be endurable; unfortunately we carry inside us that little organ which we call the heart, which is subject to certain maladies in the course of which it is infinitely impressionable by everything that concerns the life of a certain person, so that a lie — that most harmless of things, in the midst of which we live so unconcernedly, if the lie be told by ourselves or by strangers — coming from that person, causes the little heart, which surgeons ought really to be able to excise from us, intolerable anguish. let us not speak of the brain, for our mind may go on reasoning interminably in the course of this ansuish, it does no more to mitigate it than by taking thought can we soothe an aching tooth. it is true that this person is to blame for having lied to us, for she had sworn to us that she would always tell us the truth. but we know from our own shortcomings, towards other people, how little an oath is worth. and we have deliberately believed them when they came from her, the very person to whose interest it has always been to lie to us, and whom, moreover, we did not select for her virtues. it is true that, later on, she would almost cease to have any need to lie to us — at the moment when our heart will have grown indifferent to her falsehood — because then we shall not feel any interest in her life. we know this, and, notwithstanding, we deliberately sacrifice our own lives, either by killing ourselves for her sake, or by letting ourselves be sentenced to death for having murdered her, or simply by spending, in the course of a few evenings, our whole fortune upon her, which will oblige us presently to commit suicide because we have not a penny in the world. besides, however calm we may imagine ourselves when we are in love, we always have love in our heart in a state of unstable equilibrium. a trifle is sufficient to exalt it to the position of happiness, we radiate happiness, we smother in our affection not her whom we love, but those who have given us merit in her eyes, who have protected her from every evil temptation; we think that our mind is at ease, and a word is sufficient: ‘gilberte is not coming,’ ‘mademoiselle vinteuil is expected,’ to make all the preconceived happiness towards which we were rising collapse, to make the sun hide his face, to open the bag of the winds and let loose the internal tempest which one day we shall be incapable of resisting. that day, the day upon which the heart has become so frail, our friends who respect us are pained that such trifles, that certain persons, can so affect us, can bring us to death’s door. but what are they to do? if a poet is dying of septic pneumonia, can one imagine his friends explaining to the pneumococcus that the poet is a man of talent and that it ought to let him recover? my doubt, in so far as it referred to mlle. vinteuil, was not entirely novel. but to a certain extent, my jealousy of the afternoon, inspired by léa and her friends, had abolished it. once that peril of the trocadéro was removed, i had felt that i had recaptured for all time complete peace of mind. but what was entirely novel to me was a certain excursion as to which andrée had told me: “we went to this place and that, we didn’t meet anyone,” and during which, on the contrary, mlle. vinteuil had evidently arranged to meet albertine at mme. verdurin’s. at this moment i would gladly have allowed albertine to go out by herself, to go wherever she might choose, provided that i might lock up mlle. vinteuil and her friend somewhere and be certain that albertine would not meet them. the fact is that jealousy is, as a rule, partial, of intermittent application, whether because it is the painful extension of an anxiety which is provoked now by one person, now by another with whom our mistress may be in love, or because of the exiguity of our thought which is able to realise only what it can represent to itself and leaves everything else in an obscurity which can cause us only a proportionately modified anguish     just as we were about to ring the bell we were overtaken by saniette who informed us that princess sherbatoff had died at six o’clock, and added that he had not at first recognised us. “i envisaged you, however, for some time,” he told us in a breathless voice. “is it aught but curious that i should have hesitated?” to say “is it not curious” would have seemed to him wrong, and he had acquired a familiarity with obsolete forms of speech that was becoming exasperating. “not but what you are people whom one may acknowledge as friends.” his grey complexion seemed to be illuminated by the livid glow of a storm. his breathlessness, which had been noticeable, as recently as last summer, only when m. verdurin ‘jumped down his throat,’ was now continuous. “i understand that an unknown work of vinteuil is to be performed by excellent artists, and singularly by morel.” “why singularly?” inquired the baron who detected a criticism in the adverb. “our friend saniette,” brichot made haste to exclaim, acting as interpreter, “is prone to speak, like the excellent scholar that he is, the language of an age in which ‘singularly’ was equivalent to our ‘especially.’”     as we entered the verdurins’ hall, m. de charlus asked me whether i was engaged upon any work and as i told him that i was not, but that i was greatly interested at the moment in old dinner-services of plate and porcelain, he assured me that i could not see any finer than those that the verdurins had; that moreover i might have seen them at la raspelière, since, on the pretext that one’s possessions are also one’s friends, they were so silly as to cart everything down there with them; it would be less convenient to bring everything out for my benefit on the evening of a party; still, he would tell them to shew me anything that i wished to see. i begged him not to do anything of the sort. m. de charlus unbuttoned his greatcoat, took off his hat, and i saw that the top of his head had now turned silver in patches. but like a precious shrub which is not only coloured with autumn tints but certain leaves of which are protected by bandages of wadding or incrustations of plaster, m. de charlus received from these few white hairs at his crest only a further variegation added to those of his face. and yet, even beneath the layers of different expressions, paint and hypocrisy which formed such a bad ‘make-up,’ his face continued to hide from almost everyone the secret that it seemed to me to be crying aloud. i was almost put to shame by his eyes in which i was afraid of his surprising me in the act of reading it, as from an open book, by his voice which seemed to me to be repeating it in every tone, with an untiring indecency. but secrets are well kept by such people, for everyone who comes in contact with them is deaf and blind. the people who learned the truth from some one else, from the verdurins for instance, believed it, but only for so long as they had not met m. de charlus. his face, so far from spreading, dissipated every scandalous rumour. for we form so extravagant an idea of certain characters that we would be incapable of identifying one of them with the familiar features of a person of our acquaintance. and we find it difficult to believe in such a person’s vices, just as we can never believe in the genius of a person with whom we went to the opera last night     m. de charlus was engaged in handing over his greatcoat with the instructions of a familiar guest. but the footman to whom he was handing it was a newcomer, and quite young. now m. de charlus had by this time begun, as people say, to ‘lose his bearings’ and did not always remember what might and what might not be done. the praiseworthy desire that he had felt at balbec to shew that certain topics did not alarm him, that he was not afraid to declare with regard to some one or other: “he is a nice-looking boy,” to utter, in short, the same words as might have been uttered by somebody who was not like himself, this desire he had now begun to express by saying on the contrary things which nobody could ever have said who was not like him, things upon which his mind was so constantly fixed that he forgot that they do not form part of the habitual preoccupation of people in general. and so, as he gazed at the new footman, he raised his forefinger in the air in a menacing fashion and, thinking that he was making an excellent joke: “you are not to make eyes at me like that, do you hear?” said the baron, and, turning to brichot: “he has a quaint little face, that boy, his nose is rather fun,” and, completing his joke, or yielding to a desire, he lowered his forefinger horizontally, hesitated for an instant, then, unable to control himself any longer, thrust it irresistibly forwards at the footman and touched the tip of his nose, saying “pif!” “that’s a rum card,” the footman said to himself, and inquired of his companions whether it was a joke or what it was. “it is just a way he has,” said the butler (who regarded the baron as slightly ‘touched,’ ‘a bit balmy’), “but he is one of madame’s friends for whom i have always had the greatest respect, he has a good heart.”      “are you coming back this year to incarville?” brichot asked me. “i believe that our hostess has taken la raspelière again, for all that she has had a crow to pick with her landlords. but that is nothing, it is a cloud that passes,” he added in the optimistic tone of the newspapers that say: “mistakes have been made, it is true, but who does not make mistakes at times?” but i remembered the state of anguish in which i had left balbec, and felt no desire to return there. i kept putting off to the morrow my plans for albertine. “why, of course he is coming back, we need him, he is indispensable to us,” declared m. de charlus with the authoritative and uncomprehending egoism of friendliness     at this moment m. verdurin appeared to welcome us. when we expressed our sympathy over princess sherbatoff, he said: “yes, i believe she is rather ill.” “no, no, she died at six o’clock,” exclaimed saniette. “oh, you exaggerate everything,” was m. verdurin’s brutal retort, for, since he had not cancelled his party, he preferred the hypothesis of illness, imitating unconsciously the duc de guermantes. saniette, not without fear of catching cold, for the outer door was continually being opened, stood waiting resignedly for some one to take his hat and coat. “what are you hanging about there for, like a whipped dog?” m. verdurin asked him. “i am waiting until one of the persons who are charged with the cloakroom can take my coat and give me a number.” “what is that you say?” demanded m. verdurin with a stern expression. “‘charged with the cloakroom?’ are you going off your head? ‘in charge of the cloakroom,’ is what we say, if we’ve got to teach you to speak your own language, like a man who has had a stroke.” “charged with a thing is the correct form,” murmured saniette in a stifled tone; “the abbé le batteux. . . . ” “you make me tired, you do,” cried m. verdurin in a voice of thunder. “how you do wheezel have you been running upstairs to an attic?” the effect of m. verdurin’s rudeness was that the servants in the cloakroom allowed other guests to take precedence of saniette and, when he tried to hand over his things, replied: “wait for your turn, sir, don’t be in such a hurry.” “there’s system for you, competent fellows, that’s right, my lads,” said m. verdurin with an approving smile, in order to encourage them in their tendency to keep saniette waiting till the end. “come along,” he said to us, “the creature wants us all to catch our death hanging about in his beloved draught. come and get warm in the drawing-room. ‘charged with the cloakroom,’ indeed, what an idiot!” “he is inclined to be a little precious, but he’s not a bad fellow,” said brichot. “i never said that he was a bad fellow, i said that he was an idiot,” was m. verdurin’s harsh retort     meanwhile mme. verdurin was busily engaged with cottard and ski. morel had just declined (because m. de charlus could not be present) an invitation from some friends of hers to whom she had promised the services of the violinist. the reason for morel’s refusal to perform at the party which the verdurins’ friends were giving, a reason which we shall presently see reinforced by others of a far more serious kind, might have found its justification in a habit common to the leisured classes in general but specially distinctive of the little nucleus. to be sure, if mme. verdurin intercepted between a newcomer and one of the faithful a whispered speech which might let it be supposed that they were already acquainted, or wished to become more intimate (“on friday, then, at so-and-so’s,” or “come to the studio any day you like; i am always there until five o’clock, i shall look forward to seeing you”), agitated, supposing the newcomer to occupy a ‘position’ which would make him a brilliant recruit to the little clan, the mistress, while pretending not to have heard anything, and preserving in her fine eyes, shadowed by the habit of listening to debussy more than they would have been by that of sniffing cocaine, the extenuated expression that they derived from musical intoxication alone, revolved nevertheless behind her splendid brow, inflated by all those quartets and the headaches that were their consequence, thoughts which were not exclusively polyphonic, and unable to contain herself any longer, unable to postpone the injection for another instant, flung herself upon the speakers, drew them apart, and said to the newcomer, pointing to the ‘faithful’ one: “you wouldn’t care to come and dine to meet him, next saturday, shall we say, or any day you like, with some really nice people! don’t speak too loud, as i don’t want to invite all this mob” (a word used to denote for five minutes the little nucleus, disdained for the moment in favour of the newcomer in whom so many hqpes were placed)     but this infatuated impulse, this need to make friendly overtures, had its counterpart. assiduous attendance at their wednesdays aroused in the verdurins an opposite tendency. this was the desire to quarrel, to hold aloof. it had been strengthened, had almost been wrought to a frenzy during the months spent at la raspelière, where they were all together morning, noon and night. m. verdurin went out of his way to prove one of his guests in the wrong, to spin webs in which he might hand over to his comrade spider some innocent fly. failing a grievance, he would invent some absurdity. as soon as one of the faithful had been out of the house for half an hour, they would make fun of him in front of the others, would feign surprise that their guests had not noticed how his teeth were never clean, or how on the contrary he had a mania for brushing them twenty times a day. if any one took the liberty of opening a window, this want of breeding would cause a glance of disgust to pass between host and hostess. a moment later mme. verdurin would ask for a shawl, which gave m. verdurin an excuse for saying in a tone of fury: “no, i shall close the window, i wonder who had the impertinence to open it,” in the hearing of the guilty wretch who blushed to the roots of his hair. you were rebuked indirectly for the quantity of wine that you had drunk. “it won’t do you any harm. navvies thrive on it!” if two of the faithful went out together without first obtaining permission from the mistress, their excursions led to endless comments, however innocent they might be. those of m. de charlus with morel were not innocent. it was only the fact that m. de charlus was not staying at la raspelière (because morel was obliged to live near his barracks) that retarded the hour of satiety, disgust, retching. that hour was, however, about to strike    mme. verdurin was furious and determined to ‘enlighten’ morel as to the ridiculous and detestable part that m. de charlus was making him play. “i must add,” she went on (mme. verdurin, when she felt that she owed anyone a debt of gratitude which would be a burden to him, and was unable to rid herself of it by killing him, would discover a serious defect in him which would honourably dispense her from shewing her gratitude), “i must add that he gives himself airs in my house which i do not at all like.” the truth was that mme. verdurin had another more serious reason than morel’s refusal to play at her friends’ party for picking a quarrel with m. de charlus. the latter, overcome by the honour he was doing the mistress in bringing to quai conti people who after all would never have come there for her sake, had, on hearing the first names that mme. verdurin had suggested as those of people who ought to be invited, pronounced the most categorical ban upon them in a peremptory tone which blended the rancorous pride of a crotchety nobleman with the dogmatism of the expert artist in questions of entertainment who would cancel his programme and withhold his collaboration sooner than agree to concessions which, in his opinion, would endanger the success of the whole. m. de charlus had given his approval, hedging it round with reservations, to saintine alone, with whom, in order not to be bothered with his wife, mme. de guermantes had passed, from a daily intimacy, to a complete severance of relations, but whom m. de charlus, finding him intelligent, continued to see. true, it was among a middle-class set, with a cross-breeding of the minor nobility, where people are merely very rich and connected with an aristocracy whom the true aristocracy does not know, that saintine, at one time the flower of the guermantes set, had gone to seek his fortune and, he imagined, a social foothold. but mme. verdurin, knowing the blue-blooded pretensions of the wife’s circle, and failing to take into account the husband’s position (for it is what is immediately over our head that gives us the impression of altitude and not what is almost invisible to us, so far is it lost in the clouds), felt that she ought to justify an invitation of saintine by pointing out that he knew a great many people, “having married mlle. ——-.” the ignorance which this assertion, the direct opposite of the truth, revealed in mme. verdurin caused the baron’s painted lips to part in a smile of indulgent scorn and wide comprehension. he disdained a direct answer, but as he was always ready to express in social examples theories which shewed the fertility of his mind and the arrogance of his pride, with the inherited frivolity of his occupations: “saintine ought to have come to me before marrying,” he said, “there is such a thing as social as well as physiological eugenics, and i am perhaps the only specialist in existence. saintine’s case aroused no discussion, it was clear that, in making the marriage that he made, he was tying a stone to his neck, and hiding his light under a bushel. his social career was at an end. i should have explained this to him, and he would have understood me, for he is quite intelligent. on the other hand, there was a person who had everything that he required to make his position exalted, predominant, world-wide, only a terrible cable bound him to the earth. i helped him, partly by pressure, partly by force, to break his bonds and now he has won, with a triumphant joy, the freedom, the omnipotence that he owes to me; it required, perhaps, a little determination on his part, but what a reward! thus a man can himself, when he has the sense to listen to me, become the midwife of his destiny.” it was only too clear that m. de charlus had not been able to influence his own; action is a different thing from speech, even eloquent speech, and from thought, even the thoughts of genius. “but, so far as i am concerned, i live the life of a philosopher who looks on with interest at the social reactions which i have foretold, but who does not assist them. and so i have continued to visit saintine, who has always received me with the whole-hearted deference which is my due. i have even dined with him in his new abode, where one is heavily bored, in the midst of the most sumptuous splendour, as one used to be amused in the old days when, living from hand to mouth, he used to assemble the best society in a wretched attic. him, then, you may invite, i give you leave, but i rule out with my veto all the other names that you have mentioned. and you will thank me for it, for, if i am an expert in arranging marriages, i am no less an expert in arranging parties. i know the rising people who give tone to a gathering, make it go; and i know also the names that will bring it down to the ground, make it fall flat.” these exclusions were not always founded upon the baron’s personal resentments nor upon his artistic refinements, but upon his skill as an actor. when he had perfected, at the expense of somebody or something, an entirely successful epigram, he was anxious to let it be heard by the largest possible audience, but took care not to admit to the second performance the audience of the first who could have borne witness that the novelty was not novel. he would then rearrange his drawing-room, simply because he did not alter his programme, and, when he had scored a success in conversation, would, if need be, have organised a tour, and given exhibitions in the provinces. whatever may have been the various motives for these exclusions, they did not merely annoy mme. verdurin, who felt her authority as a hostess impaired, they also did her great damage socially, and for two reasons. the first was that m. de charlus, even more susceptible than jupien, used to quarrel, without anyone’s ever knowing why, with the people who were most suited to be his friends. naturally, one of the first punishments that he could inflict upon them was that of not allowing them to be invited to a party which he was giving at the verdurins’. now these pariahs were often people who are in the habit of ruling the roost, as the saying is, but who in m. de charlus’s eyes had ceased to rule it from the day on which he had quarrelled with them. for his imagination, in addition to finding people in the wrong in order to quarrel with them, was no less ingenious in stripping them of all importance as soon as they ceased to be his friends. if, for instance, the guilty person came of an extremely old family, whose dukedom, however, dates only from the nineteenth century, such a family as the montesquieu, from that moment all that counted for m. de charlus was the precedence of the dukedom, the family becoming nothing. “they are not even dukes,” he would exclaim. “it is the title of the abbé de montesquieu which passed most irregularly to a collateral, less than eighty years ago. the present duke, if duke he can be called, is the third. you may talk to me if you like of people like the uzès, the la trémoïlîe, the luynes, who are tenth or fourteenth dukes, or my brother who is twelfth duc de guermantes and seventeenth prince of cordova. the montesquieu are descended from an old family, what would that prove, supposing that it were proved? they have descended so far that they have reached the fourteenth storey below stairs.” had he on the contrary quarrelled with a gentleman who possessed an ancient dukedom, who boasted the most magnificent connexions, was related to ruling princes, but to whose line this distinction had come quite suddenly without any length of pedigree, a luynes for instance, the case was altered, pedigree alone counted. “i ask you — m. alberti, who does not emerge from the mire until louis xiii. what can it matter to us that favouritism at court allowed them to pick up dukedoms to which they have no right?” what was more, with m. de charlus, the fall came immediately after the exaltation because of that tendency peculiar to the guermantes to expect from conversation, from friendship, something that these are incapable of giving, as well as the symptomatic fear of becoming the objects of slander. and the fall was all the greater, the higher the exaltation had been. now nobody had ever found such favour with the baron as he had markedly shewn for comtesse mole. by what sign of indifference did she reveal, one fine day, that she had been unworthy of it? the comtesse always maintained that she had never been able to solve the problem. the fact remains that the mere sound of her name aroused in the baron the most violent rage, provoked the most eloquent but the most terrible philippics. mme. verdurin, to whom mme. molé had been very kind, and who was founding, as we shall see, great hopes upon her and had rejoiced in anticipation at the thought that the comtesse would meet in her house all the noblest names, as the mistress said, “of france and navarre,” at once proposed to invite “madame de molé.” “oh, my god! everyone has his own taste,” m. de charlus had replied, “and if you, madame, feel a desire to converse with mme. pipelet, mme. gibout and mme. joseph prudhomme, i ask nothing better, but let it be on an evening when i am not present. i could see as soon as you opened your mouth that we do not speak the same language, since i was mentioning the names of the nobility, and you retort with the most obscure names of professional and tradespeople, dirty scandalmongering little bounders, little women who imagine themselves patronesses of the arts because they repeat, an octave lower, the manners of my guermantes sister-in-law, like a jay that thinks it is imitating a peacock. i must add that it would be positively indecent to admit to a party which i am pleased to give at mme. verdurin’s a person whom i have with good reason excluded from my society, a sheep devoid of birth, loyalty, intelligence, who is so idiotic as to suppose that she is capable of playing the duchesse de guermantes and the princesse de guermantes, a combination which is in itself idiotic, since the duchesse de guermantes and the princesse de guermantes are poles apart. it is as though a person should pretend to be at once reichenberg and sarah bernhardt. in any case, even if it were not impossible, it would be extremely ridiculous. even though i may, myself, smile at times at the exaggeration of one and regret the limitations of the other, that is my right. but that upstart little frog trying to blow herself out to the magnitude of two great ladies who, at all events, always reveal the incomparable distinction of blood, it is enough, as the saying is, to make a cat laugh. the molé! that is a name which must not be uttered in my hearing, or else i must simply withdraw,” he concluded with a smile, in the tone of a doctor, who, thinking of his patient’s interests in spite of that same patient’s opposition, lets it be understood that he will not tolerate the collaboration of a homoeopath. on the other hand, certain persons whom m. de charlus regarded as negligible might indeed be so for him but not for mme. verdurin. m. de charlus, with his exalted birth, could afford to dispense with people in the height of fashion, the assemblage of whom would have made mme. verdurin’s drawing-room one of the first in paris. she, at the same time, was beginning to feel that she had already on more than one occasion missed the coach, not to mention the enormous retardation that the social error of the dreyfus case had inflicted upon her, not without doing her a service all the same. i forget whether i have mentioned the disapproval with which the duchesse de guermantes had observed certain persons of her world who, subordinating everything else to the case, excluded fashionable women from their drawing-rooms and admitted others who were not fashionable, because they were for or against the fresh trial, and had then been criticised in her turn by those same ladies, as lukewarm, unsound in her views, and guilty of placing social distinctions above the national interests; may i appeal to the reader, as to a friend with regard to whom one completely forgets, at the end of a conversation, whether one has remembered, or had an opportunity to tell him something important? whether i have done so or not, the attitude of the duchesse de guermantes can easily be imagined, and indeed if we look at it in the light of subsequent history may appear, from the social point of view, perfectly correct. m. de cambremer regarded the dreyfus case as a foreign machination intended to destroy the intelligence service, to undermine discipline, to weaken the army, to divide the french people, to pave the way for invasion. literature being, apart from a few of la fontaine’s fables, a sealed book to the marquis, he left it to his wife to prove that the cruelly introspective writers of the day had, by creating a spirit of irreverence, arrived by a parallel course at a similar result. “m. reinach and m. hervieu are in the plot,” she would say. nobody will accuse the dreyfus case of having premeditated such dark designs upon society. but there it certainly has broken down the hedges. the social leaders who refuse to allow politics into society are as foreseeing as the soldiers who refuse to allow politics to permeate the army. society is like the sexual appetite; one does not know at what forms of perversion it may not arrive, once we have allowed our choice to be dictated by aesthetic considerations. the reason that they were nationalists gave the faubourg saint-germain the habit of entertaining ladies from another class of society; the reason vanished with nationalism, the habit remained. mme. verdurin, by the bond of dreyfusism, had attracted to her house certain writers of distinction who for the moment were of no advantage to her socially, because they were dreyfusards. but political passions are like all the rest, they do not last. fresh generations arise which are incapable of understanding them. even the generation that felt them changes, feels political passions which, not being modelled exactly upon their predecessors, make it rehabilitate some of the excluded, the reason for exclusion having altered. monarchists no longer cared, at the time of the dreyfus case, whether a man had been a republican, that is to say a radical, that is to say anticlerical, provided that he was an anti-semite and a nationalist. should a war ever come, patriotism would assume another form and if a writer was chauvinistic nobody would stop to think whether he had or had not been a dreyfusard. it was thus that, at each political crisis, at each artistic revival, mme. verdurin had collected one by one, like a bird building its nest, the several items, useless for the moment, of what would one day be her salon. the dreyfus case had passed, anatole france remained. mme. verdurin’s strength lay in her genuine love of art, the trouble that she used to take for her faithful, the marvellous dinners that she gave for them alone, without inviting anyone from the world of fashion. each of the faithful was treated at her table as bergotte had been treated at mme. swann’s. when a boon companion of this sort had turned into an illustrious man whom everybody was longing to meet, his presence at mme. verdurin’s had none of the artificial, composite effect of a dish at an official or farewell banquet, cooked by potel or chabot, but was merely a delicious ‘ordinary’ which you would have found there in the same perfection on a day when there was no party at all. at mme. verdurin’s the cast was trained to perfection, the repertory most select, all that was lacking was an audience. and now that the public taste had begun to turn from the rational and french art of a bergotte, and to go in, above all things, for exotic forms of music, mme. verdurin, a sort of official representative in paris of all foreign artists, was not long in making her appearance, by the side of the exquisite princess yourbeletief, an aged fairy godmother, grim but all-powerful, to the russian dancers. this charming invasion, against whose seductions only the stupidest of critics protested, infected paris, as we know, with a fever of curiosity less burning, more purely aesthetic, but quite as intense perhaps as that aroused by the dreyfus case. there again mme. verdurin, but with a very different result socially, was to take her place in the front row. just as she had been seen by the side of mme. zola, immediately under the bench, during the trial in the assize court, so when the new generation of humanity, in their enthusiasm for the russian ballet, thronged to the opera, crowned with the latest novelty in aigrettes, they invariably saw in a stage box mme. verdurin by the side of princess yourbeletief. and just as, after the emotions of the law courts, people used to go in the evening to mme. verdurin’s, to meet picquart or labori in the flesh and what was more to hear the latest news of the case, to learn what hopes might be placed in zurlinden, loubet, colonel jouaust, the regulations, so now, little inclined for sleep after the enthusiasm aroused by the scheherazade or prince igor, they repaired to mme. verdurin’s, where under the auspices of princess yourbeletief and their hostess an exquisite supper brought together every night the dancers themselves, who had abstained from dinner so as to be more resilient, their director, their designers, the great composers igor stravinski and richard strauss, a permanent little nucleus, around which, as round the supper-table of m. and mme. helvétius, the greatest ladies in paris and foreign royalties were not too proud to gather. even those people in society who professed to be endowed with taste and drew unnecessary distinctions between the various russian ballets, regarding the setting of the sylphides as somehow ‘purer’ than that of scheherazade, which they were almost prepared to attribute to negro inspiration, were enchanted to meet face to face the great revivers of theatrical taste, who in an art that is perhaps a little more artificial than that of the easel had created a revolution as profound as impressionism itself     to revert to m. de charlus, mme. verdurin would not have minded so much if he had placed on his index only comtesse molé and mme. bontemps, whom she had picked out at odette’s on the strength of her love of the fine arts, and who during the dreyfus case had come to dinner occasionally bringing her husband, whom mme. verdurin called ‘lukewarm,’ because he was not making any move for a fresh trial, but who, being extremely intelligent, and glad to form relations in every camp, was delighted to shew his independence by dining at the same table as labori, to whom he listened without uttering a word that might compromise himself, but managed to slip in at the right moment a tribute to the loyalty, recognised by all parties, of jaurès. but the baron had similarly proscribed several ladies of the aristocracy whose acquaintance mme. verdurin, on the occasion of some musical festivity or a collection for charity, had recently formed and who, whatever m. de charlus might think of them, would have been, far more than himself, essential to the formation of a fresh nucleus at mme. verdurin’s, this time aristocratic. mme. verdurin had indeed been reckoning upon this party, to which m. de charlus would be bringing her women of the same set, to mix her new friends with them, and had been relishing in anticipation the surprise that the latter would feel upon meeting at quai conti their own friends or relatives invited there by the baron. she was disappointed and furious at his veto. it remained to be seen whether the evening, in these conditions, would result in profit or loss to herself. the loss would not be too serious if only m. de charlus’s guests came with so friendly a feeling for mme. verdurin that they would become her friends in the future. in this case the mischief would be only half done, these two sections of the fashionable world, which the baron had insisted upon keeping apart, would be united later on, he himself being excluded, of course, when the time came. and so mme. verdurin was awaiting the baron’s guests with a certain emotion. she would not be slow in discovering the state of mind in which they came, and the degree of intimacy to which she might hope to attain. while she waited, mme. verdurin took counsel with the faithful, but, upon seeing m. de charlus enter the room with brichot and myself, stopped short. greatly to our astonishment, when brichot told her how sorry he was to learn that her dear friend was so seriously ill, mme. verdurin replied: “listen, i am obliged to confess that i am not at all sorry. it is useless to pretend to feel what one does not feel.” no doubt she spoke thus from want of energy, because she shrank from the idea of wearing a long face throughout her party, from pride, in order not to appear to be seeking excuses for not having cancelled her invitations, from self-respect also and social aptitude, because the absence of grief which she displayed was more honourable if it could be attributed to a peculiar antipathy, suddenly revealed, to the princess, rather than to a universal insensibility, and because her hearers could not fail to be disarmed by a sincerity as to which there could be no doubt. if mme. verdurin had not been genuinely unaffected by the death of the princess, would she have gone on to excuse herself for giving the party, by accusing herself of a far more serious fault? besides, one was apt to forget that mme. verdurin would thus have admitted, while confessing her grief, that she had not had the strength of mind to forego a pleasure; whereas the indifference of the friend was something more shocking, more immoral, but less humiliating, and consequently easier to confess than the frivolity of the hostess. in matters of crime, where the culprit is in danger, it is his material interest that prompts the confession. where the fault incurs no penalty, it is self-esteem. whether it was that, doubtless feeling the pretext to be too hackneyed of the people who, so as not to allow a bereavement to interrupt their life of pleasure, go about saying that it seems to them useless to display the outward signs of a grief which they feel in their hearts, mme. verdurin preferred to imitate those intelligent culprits who are revolted by the commonplaces of innocence and whose defence — a partial admission, though they do not know it — consists in saying that they would see no harm in doing what they are accused of doing, although, as it happens, they have had no occasion to do it; or that, having adopted, to explain her conduct, the theory of indifference, she found, once she had started upon the downward slope of her unnatural feeling, that it was distinctly original to have felt it, that she displayed a rare perspicacity in having managed to diagnose her own symptoms, and a certain ‘nerve’ in proclaiming them; anyhow, mme. verdurin kept dwelling upon her want of grief, not without a certain proud satisfaction, as of a paradoxical psychologist and daring dramatist. “yes, it is very funny,” she said, “i hardly felt it. of course, i don’t mean to say that i wouldn’t rather she were still alive, she was not a bad person.” “yes, she was,” put in m. verdurin. “ah! he doesn’t approve of her because he thought that i was doing myself harm by having her here, but he is quite pig-headed about that.” “do me the justice to admit,” said m. verdurin, “that i never approved of your having her. i always told you that she had a bad reputation.” “but i have never heard a thing against her,” protested saniette. “what!” exclaimed mme. verdurin, “everybody knew; bad isn’t the word, it was scandalous, appalling. no, it has nothing to do with that. i couldn’t explain, myself, what i felt; i didn’t dislike her, but i took so little interest in her that, when we heard that she was seriously ill, my husband himself was quite surprised, and said: ‘anyone would think that you didn’t mind.’ why, this evening, he offered to put off the party, and i insisted upon having it, because i should have thought it a farce to shew a grief which i do not feel.” she said this because she felt that it had a curious smack of the ‘independent theatre,’ and was at the same time singularly convenient; for an admitted insensibility or immorality simplifies life as much as does easy virtue; it converts reproachable actions, for which one no longer need seek any excuse, into a duty imposed by sincerity. and the faithful listened to mme. verdurin’s speech with the blend of admiration and misgiving which certain cruelly realistic plays, that shewed a profound observation, used at one time to cause, and, while they marvelled to see their beloved mistress display a novel aspect of her rectitude and independence, more than one of them, albeit he assured himself that after all it would not be the same thing, thought of his own death, and asked himself whether, on the day when death came to him, they would draw the blinds or give a party at quai conti. “i am very glad that the party has not been put off, for my guests’ sake,” said m. de charlus, not realising that in expressing himself thus he was offending mme. verdurin. meanwhile i was struck, as was everybody who approached mme. verdurin that evening, by a far from pleasant odour of rhinogomenol. the reason was as follows. we know that mme. verdurin never expressed her artistic feelings in a moral, but always in a physical fashion, so that they might appear more inevitable and more profound. so, if one spoke to her of vinteuil’s music, her favourite, she remained unmoved, as though she expected to derive no emotion from it. but after a few minutes of a fixed, almost abstracted gaze, in a sharp, matter of fact, scarcely civil tone (as though she had said to you: “i don’t in the least mind your smoking, it’s because of the carpet; it’s a very fine one  , but it’s highly inflammable, i’m dreadfully afraid of fire, and i shouldn’t like to see you all roasted because some one had carelessly dropped a cigarette end on it”), she replied: “i have no fault to find with vinteuil; to my mind, he is the greatest composer of the age, only i can never listen to that sort of stuff without weeping all the time” (she did not apply any pathos to the word ‘weeping,’ she would have used precisely the same tone for ‘sleeping’; certain slandermongers used indeed to insist that the latter verb would have been more applicable, though no one could ever be certain, for she listened to the music with her face buried in her hands, and certain snoring sounds might after all have been sobs). “i don’t mind weeping, not in the least; only i get the most appalling colds afterwards. it stuffs up my mucous membrane, and the day after i look like nothing on earth. i have to inhale for days on end before i can utter. however, one of cottard’s pupils, a charming person, has been treating me for it. he goes by quite an original rule: ‘prevention is better than cure.’ and he greases my nose before the music begins. it is radical. i can weep like all the mothers who ever lost a child, not a trace of a cold. sometimes a little conjunctivitis, that’s all. it is absolutely efficacious. otherwise i could never have gone on listening to vinteuil. i was just going from one bronchitis to another.” i could not refrain from alluding to mlle. vinteuil. “isn’t the composer’s daughter to be here,” i asked mme. verdurin, “with one of her friends?” “no, i have just had a telegram,” mme. verdurin said evasively, “they have been obliged to remain in the country.” i felt a momentary hope that there might never have been any question of their leaving it and that mme. verdurin had announced the presence of these representatives of the composer only in order to make a favourable impression upon the performers and their audience. “what, didn’t they come, then, to the rehearsal this afternoon?” came with a feigned curiosity from the baron who was anxious to let it appear that he had not seen charlie. the latter came up to greet me. i whispered a question in his ear about mlle. vinteuil; he seemed to me to know little or nothing about her. i signalled to him not to let himself be heard and told him that we should discuss the question later on. he bowed, and assured me that he would be delighted to place himself entirely at my disposal. i observed that he was far more polite, more respectful, than he had been in the past. i spoke warmly of him — who might perhaps be able to help me to clear up my suspicions — to m. de charlus who replied: “he only does what is natural, there would be no point in his living among respectable people if he didn’t learn good manners.” these, according to m. de charlus, were the old manners of france, untainted by any british bluntness. thus when charlie, returning from a tour in the provinces or abroad, arrived in his travelling suit at the baron’s, the latter, if there were not too many people present, would kiss him without ceremony upon both cheeks, perhaps a little in order to banish by so ostentatious a display of his affection any idea of its being criminal, perhaps because he could not deny himself a pleasure, but still more, doubtless, from a literary sense, as upholding and illustrating the traditional manners of france, and, just as he would have countered the munich or modern style of furniture by keeping in his rooms old armchairs that had come to him from a great-grandmother, countering the british phlegm with the affection of a warm-hearted father of the eighteenth century, unable to conceal his joy at beholding his son once more. was there indeed a trace of incest in this paternal affection? it is more probable that the way in which m. de charlus habitually appeased his vicious cravings, as to which we shall learn something in due course, was not sufficient for the need of affection, which had remained unsatisfied since the death of his wife; the fact remains that after having thought more than once of a second marriage, he was now devoured by a maniacal desire to adopt an heir. people said that he was going to adopt morel, and there was nothing extraordinary in that. the invert who has been unable to feed his passion save on a literature written for women-loving men, who used to think of men when he read mussel’snuits, feels the need to partake, nevertheless, in all the social activities of the man who is not an invert, to keep a lover, as the old frequenter of the opera keeps ballet-girls, to settle down, to marry or form a permanent tie, to become a father     m. de charlus took morel aside on the pretext of making him tell him what was going to be played, but above all finding a great consolation, while charlie shewed him his music, in displaying thus publicly their secret intimacy. in the meantime i myself felt a certain charm. for albeit the little clan included few girls, on the other hand girls were abundantly invited on the big evenings. there were a number present, and very pretty girls too, whom i knew. they wafted smiles of greeting to me across the room. the air was thus decorated at every moment with the charming smile of some girl. that is the manifold, occasional ornament of evening parties, as it is of days. we remember an atmosphere because girls were smiling in it     many people might have been greatly surprised had they overheard the furtive remarks which m. de charlus exchanged with a number of important gentlemen at this party. these were two dukes, a distinguished general, a great writer, a great physician, a great barrister. and the remarks in question were: “by the way, did you notice the footman, i mean the little fellow they take on the carriage? at our cousin guermantes’, you don’t know of anyone?” “at the moment, no.” “i say, though, outside the door, where the carriages stop, there used to be a fair little person, in breeches, who seemed to me most attractive. she called my carriage most charmingly, i would gladly have prolonged the conversation.” “yes, but i believe she’s altogether against it, besides, she puts on airs, you like to get to business at once, you would loathe her. anyhow, i know there’s nothing doing, a friend of mine tried.” “that is a pity, i thought the profile very fine, and the hair superb.” “really, as much as that? i think, if you had seen a little more of her, you would have been disillusioned. no, in the supper-room, only two months ago you would have seen a real marvel, a great fellow six foot six, a perfect skin, and loves it, too. but he’s gone off to poland.” “ah, that is rather a long way.” “you never know, he may come back, perhaps. one always meets again somewhere.” there is no great social function that does not, if, in taking a section of it, we contrive to cut sufficiently deep, resemble those parties to which doctors invite their patients, who utter the most intelligent remarks, have perfect manners, and would never shew that they were mad did they not whisper in our ear, pointing to some old gentleman who goes past: “that’s joan of arc.”      “i feel that it is our duty to enlighten him,” mme. verdurin said to brichot. “not that i have anything against charlus, far from it. he is a pleasant fellow and as for his reputation, i don’t mind saying that it is not of a sort that can do me any harm! as far as i’m concerned, in our little clan, in our table-talk, as i detest flirts, the men who talk nonsense to a woman in a corner instead of discussing interesting topics, i’ve never had any fear with charlus of what happened to me with swann, and elstir, and lots of them. with him i was quite safe, he would come to my dinners, all the women in the world might be there, you could be certain that the general conversation would not be disturbed by flirtations and whisperings. charlus is in a class of his own, one doesn’t worry, he might be a priest. only, he must not be allowed to take it upon himself to order about the young men who come to the house and make a nuisance of himself in our little nucleus, or he’ll be worse than a man who runs after women.” and mme. verdurin was sincere in thus proclaiming her indulgence towards charlism. like every ecclesiastical power she regarded human frailties as less dangerous than anything that might undermine the principle of authority, impair the orthodoxy, modify the ancient creed of her little church. “if he does, then i shall bare my teeth. what do you say to a gentleman who tried to prevent charlie from coming to a rehearsal because he himself was not invited? so he’s going to be taught a lesson, i hope he’ll profit by it, otherwise he can simply take his hat and go. he keeps the boy under lock and key, upon my word he does.” and, using exactly the same expressions that almost anyone else might have used, for there are certain not in common currency which some particular subject, some given circumstance recalls almost inevitably to the mind of the speaker, who imagines that he is giving free expression to his thought when he is merely repeating mechanically the universal lesson, she went on: “it’s impossible to see morel nowadays without that great lout hanging round him, like an armed escort.” m. verdurin offered to take charlie out of the room for a minute to explain things to him, on the pretext of asking him a question. mme. verdurin was afraid that this might upset him, and that he would play badly in consequence. it would be better to postpone this performance until after the other. perhaps even until a later occasion. for however mme. verdurin might look forward to the delicious emotion that she would feel when she knew that her husband was engaged in enlightening charlie in the next room, she was afraid, if the shot missed fire, that he would lose his temper and would fail to reappear on the sixteenth     what ruined m. de charlus that evening was the ill-breeding — so common in their class — of the people whom he had invited and who were now beginning to arrive. having come there partly out of friendship for m. de charlus and also out of curiosity to explore these novel surroundings, each duchess made straight for the baron as though it were he who was giving the party and said, within a yard of the verdurins, who could hear every word: “shew me which is mother verdurin; do you think i really need speak to her? i do hope at least, that she won’t put my name in the paper to-morrow, nobody would ever speak to me again. what! that woman with the white hair, but she looks quite presentable.” hearing some mention of mlle. vinteuil, who, however, was not in the room, more than one of them said: “ah! the sonata-man’s daughter? shew me her” and, each finding a number of her friends, they formed a group by themselves, watched, sparkling with ironical curiosity, the arrival of the faithful, able at the most to point a finger at the odd way in which a person had done her hair, who, a few years later, was to make this the fashion in the very best society, and, in short, regretted that they did not find this house as different from the houses that they knew, as they had hoped to find it, feeling the disappointment of people in society who, having gone to the boîte à bruant in the hope that the singer would make a butt of them, find themselves greeted on their arrival with a polite bow instead of the expected:                              ah! voyez c’te gueule, c’te binette                             ah! voyez c’te gueule qu’elle a  m. de charlus had, at balbec, given me a perspicacious criticism of mme. de vaugoubert who, notwithstanding her keen intellect, had brought about, after his unexpected prosperity, the irremediable disgrace of her husband. the rulers to whose court m. de vaugoubert was accredited, king theodosius and queen eudoxia, having returned to paris, but this time for a prolonged visit, daily festivities had been held in their honour, in the course of which the queen, on the friendliest terms with mme. de vaugoubert, whom she had seen for the last ten years in her own capital, and knowing neither the wife of the president of the republic nor those of his ministers, had neglected these ladies and kept entirely aloof with the ambassadress. this lady, believing her own position to be unassailable — m. de vaugoubert having been responsible for the alliance between king theodosius and france — had derived from the preference that the queen shewed for her society a proud satisfaction but no anxiety at the peril that threatened her, which took shape a few months later in the fact, wrongly considered impossible by the too confident couple, of the brutal dismissal from the service of m. de vaugoubert. m. de charlus, remarking in the ‘crawler’ upon the downfall of his lifelong friend, expressed his astonishment that an intelligent woman had not, in such circumstances, brought all her influence with the king and queen to bear, so as to secure that she might not seem to possess any influence, and to make them transfer to the wives of the president and his ministers a civility by which those ladies would have been all the more flattered, that is to say which would have made them more inclined, in their satisfaction, to be grateful to the vaugouberts, inasmuch as they would have supposed that civility to be spontaneous, and not dictated by them. but the man who can see the mistakes of others need only be exhilarated by circumstances in order to succumb to them himself. and m, de charlus, while his guests fought their way towards him, to come and congratulate him, thank him, as though he were the master of the house, never thought of asking them to say a few words to mme. verdurin. only the queen of naples, in whom survived the same noble blood that had flowed in the veins of her sisters the empress elisabeth and the duchesse d’alençon, made a point of talking to mme. verdurin as though she had come for the pleasure of meeting her rather than for the music and for m. de charlus, made endless pretty speeches to her hostess, could not cease from telling her for how long she had been wishing to make her acquaintance, expressed her admiration for the house and spoke to her of all manner of subjects as though she were paying a call. she would so much have liked to bring her niece elisabeth, she said (the niece who shortly afterwards was to marry prince albert of belgium), who would be so sorry. she stopped talking when she saw the musicians mount the platform, asking which of them was morel. she can scarcely have been under any illusion as to the motives that led m. de charlus to desire that the young virtuoso should be surrounded with so much glory. but the venerable wisdom of a sovereign in whose veins flowed the blood of one of the noblest races in history, one of the richest in experience, scepticism and pride, made her merely regard the inevitable defects of the people whom she loved best, such as her cousin charlus (whose mother had been, like herself, a ‘duchess in bavaria’), as misfortunes that rendered more precious to them the support that they might find in herself and consequently made it even more pleasant to her to provide that support. she knew that m. de charlus would be doubly touched by her having taken the trouble to come, in the circumstances. only, being as good as she had long ago shewn herself brave, this heroic woman who, a soldier-queen, had herself fired her musket from the ramparts of gaeta, always ready to take her place chivalrously by the weaker side, seeing mme. verdurin alone and abandoned, and unaware (for that matter) that she ought not to leave the queen, had sought to pretend that for her, the queen of naples, the centre of this party, the lodestone that had made her come was mme. verdurin. she expressed her regret that she would not be able to remain until the end, as she had, although she never went anywhere, to go on to another party, and begged that on no account, when she had to go, should any fuss be made for her, thus discharging mme. verdurin of the honours which the latter did not even know that she ought to render     one must, however, do m. de charlus the justice of saying that, if he entirely forgot mme. verdurin and allowed her to be ignored, to a scandalous extent, by the people ‘of his own world’ whom he had invited, he did, on the other hand, realise that he must not allow these people to display, during the ‘symphonic recital’ itself, the bad manners which they were exhibiting towards the mistress. morel had already mounted the platform, the musicians were assembling, and one could still hear conversations, not to say laughter, speeches such as “it appears, one has to be initiated to understand it.” immediately m. de charlus, drawing himself erect, as though he had entered a different body from that which i had seen, not an hour ago, crawling towards mme. verdurin’s door, assumed a prophetic expression and regarded the assembly with an earnestness which indicated that this was not the moment for laughter, whereupon one saw a rapid blush tinge the cheeks of more than one lady thus publicly rebuked, like a schoolgirl scolded by her teacher in front of the whole class. to my mind, m. de charlus’s attitude, noble as it was, was somehow slightly comic; for at one moment he pulverised his guests with a flaming glare, at another, in order to indicate to them as with a vade mecum the religious silence that ought to be observed, the detachment from every worldly consideration, he furnished in himself, as he raised to his fine brow his white-gloved hands, a model (to which they must conform) of gravity, already almost of ecstasy, without acknowledging the greetings of late-comers so indelicate as not to understand that it was now the time for high art. they were all hypnotised; no one dared utter a sound, move a chair; respect for music — by virtue of palamède’s prestige — had been instantaneously inculcated in a crowd as ill-bred as it was exclusive     when i saw appear on the little platform, not only morel and a pianist, but performers upon other instruments as well, i supposed that the programme was to begin with works of composers other than vinteuil. for i imagined that the only work of his in existence was his sonata for piano and violin     mme. verdurin sat in a place apart, the twin hemispheres of her pale, slightly roseate brow magnificently curved, her hair drawn back, partly in imitation of an eighteenth century portrait, partly from the desire for coolness of a fever-stricken patient whom modesty forbids to reveal her condition, aloof, a deity presiding over musical rites, patron saint of wagnerism and sick-headaches, a sort of almost tragic norn, evoked by the spell of genius in the midst of all these bores, in whose presence she would more than ordinarily scorn to express her feelings upon hearing a piece of music which she knew better than they. the concert began, i did not know what they were playing, i found myself in a strange land. where was i to locate it? into what composer’s country had i come? i should have been glad to know, and, seeing nobody near me whom i might question, i should have liked to be a character in those arabian nights which i never tired of reading and in which, in moments of uncertainty, there arose a genie or a maiden of ravishing beauty, invisible to everyone else but not to the embarrassed hero to whom she reveals exactly what he wishes to learn. well, at this very moment i was favoured with precisely such a magical apparition. as, in a stretch of country which we suppose to be strange to us and which as a matter of fact we have approached from a new angle, when after turning out of one road we find ourself emerging suddenly upon another every inch of which is familiar only we have not been in the habit of entering it from that end, we say to ourself immediately: “why, this is the lane that leads to the garden gate of my friends the x—— i shall be there in a minute,” and there, indeed, is their daughter at the gate, come out to greet us as we pass; so, all of a sudden, i found myself, in the midst of this music that was novel to me, right in the heart of vinteuil’s sonata; and, more marvellous than any maiden, the little phrase, enveloped, harnessed in silver, glittering with brilliant effects of sound, as light and soft as silken scarves, came towards me, recognisable in this new guise. my joy at having found it again was enhanced by the accent, so friendlily familiar, which it adopted in addressing me, so persuasive, so simple, albeit without dimming the shimmering beauty with which it was resplendent. its intention, however, was, this time, merely to shew me the way, which was not the way of the sonata, for this was an unpublished work of vinteuil in which he had merely amused himself, by an allusion which was explained at this point by a sentence in the programme which one ought to have been reading simultaneously, in making the little phrase reappear for a moment. no sooner was it thus recalled than it vanished, and i found myself once more in an unknown world, but i knew now, and everything that followed only confirmed my knowledge, that this world was one of those which i had never even been capable of imagining that vinteuil could have created, for when, weary of the sonata which was to me a universe thoroughly explored, i tried to imagine others equally beautiful but different, i was merely doing what those poets do who fill their artificial paradise with meadows, flowers and streams which duplicate those existing already upon earth. what was now before me made me feel as keen a joy as the sonata would have given me if i had not already known it, and consequently, while no less beautiful, was different. whereas the sonata opened upon a dawn of lilied meadows, parting its slender whiteness to suspend itself over the frail and yet consistent mingling of a rustic bower of honeysuckle with white geraniums, it was upon continuous, level surfaces like those of the sea that, in the midst of a stormy morning beneath an already lurid sky, there began, in an eery silence, in an infinite void, this hew masterpiece, and it was into a roseate dawn that, in order to construct itself progressively before me, this unknown universe was drawn from silence and from night. this so novel redness, so absent from the tender, rustic, pale sonata, tinged all the sky, as dawn does, with a mysterious hope. and a song already thrilled the air, a song on seven notes, but the strangest, the most different from any that i had ever imagined, from any that i could ever have been able to imagine, at once ineffable and piercing, no longer the cooing of a dove as in the sonata, but rending the air, as vivid as the scarlet tinge in which the opening bars had been bathed, something like the mystical crow of a cock, an ineffable but over-shrill appeal of the eternal morning. the cold atmosphere, soaked in rain, electric — of a quality so different, feeling wholly other pressures, in a world so remote from that, virginal and endowed only with vegetable life, of the sonata — changed at every moment, obliterating the empurpled promise of the dawn. at noon, however, beneath a scorching though transitory sun, it seemed to fulfil itself in a dull, almost rustic bliss in which the peal of clanging, racing bells (like those which kindled the blaze of the square outside the church of combray, which vinteuil, who must often have heard them, had perhaps discovered at that moment in his memory like a colour which the painter’s hand has conveyed to his palette) seemed to materialise the coarsest joy. to be honest, from the aesthetic point of view, this joyous motive did not appeal to me, i found it almost ugly, its rhythm dragged so laboriously along the ground that one might have succeeded in imitating almost everything that was essential to it by merely making a noise, sounds, by the tapping of drumsticks upon a table. it seemed to me that vinteuil had been lacking, here, in inspiration, and consequently i was a little lacking also in the power of attention     i looked at the mistress, whose sullen immobility seemed to be protesting against the noddings — in time with the music — of the empty heads of the ladies of the faubourg. she did not say: “you understand that i know something about this music, and more than a little! if i had to express all that i feel, you would never hear the end of it!” she did not say this. but her upright, motionless body, her expressionless eyes, her straying locks said it for her. they spoke also of her courage, said that the musicians might go on, need not spare her nerves, that she would not flinch at the andante, would not cry out at the allegro. i looked at the musicians. the violoncellist dominated the instrument which he clutched between his knees, bowing his head to which its coarse features gave, in moments of mannerism, an involuntary expression of disgust; he leaned over it, fingered it with the same domestic patience with which he might have plucked a cabbage, while by his side the harpist (a mere girl) in a short skirt, bounded on either side by the lines of her golden quadrilateral like those which, in the magic chamber of a sibyl, would arbitrarily denote the ether, according to the consecrated rules, seemed to be going in quest, here and there, at the point required, of an exquisite sound, just as though, a little allegorical deity, placed in front of the golden trellis of the heavenly vault, she were gathering, one by one, its stars. as for morel, a lock, hitherto invisible and lost in the rest of his hair, had fallen loose and formed a curl upon his brow. i turned my head slightly towards the audience to discover what m. de charlus might be feeling at the sight of this curl. but my eyes encountered only the face, or rather the hands of mme. verdurin, for the former was entirely buried in the latter     but very soon, the triumphant motive of the bells having been banished, dispersed by others, i succumbed once again to the music; and i began to realise that if, in the body of this septet, different elements presented themselves in turn, to combine at the close, so also vinteuil’s sonata, and, as i was to find later on, his other works as well, had been no more than timid essays, exquisite but very slight, towards the triumphant and complete masterpiece which was revealed to me at this moment. and so too, i could not help recalling how i had thought of the other worlds which vinteuil might have created as of so many universes as hermetically sealed as each of my own love-affairs, whereas in reality i was obliged to admit that in the volume of my latest love — that is to say, my love for albertine — my first inklings of love for her (at balbec at the very beginning, then after the game of ferret, then on the night when she slept at the hotel, then in paris on the foggy afternoon, then on the night of the guermantes’ party, then at balbec again, and finally in paris where my life was now closely linked to her own) had been nothing more than experiments; indeed, if i were to consider, not my love for albertine, but my life as a whole, my earlier love-affairs had themselves been but slight and timid essays, experiments, which paved the way to this vaster love: my love for albertine. and i ceased to follow the music, in order to ask myself once again whether albertine had or had not seen mlle. vinteuil during the last few days, as we interrogate afresh an internal pain, from which we have been distracted for a moment. for it was in myself that albertine’s possible actions were performed. of each of the people whom we know we possess a double, but it is generally situated on the horizon of our imagination, of our memory; it remains more or less external to ourselves, and what it has done or may have done has no greater capacity to cause us pain than an object situated at a certain distance, which provides us with only the painless sensations of vision. the things that affect these people we perceive in a contemplative fashion, we are able to deplore them in appropriate language which gives other people a sense of our kindness of heart, we do not feel them; but since the wound inflicted on me at balbec, it was in my heart, at a great depth, difficult to extract, that albertine’s double was lodged. what i saw of her hurt me, as a sick man would be hurt whose senses were so seriously deranged that the sight of a colour would be felt by him internally like a knife-thrust in his living flesh. it was fortunate that i had not already yielded to the temptation to break with albertine; the boring thought that i should have to see her again presently, when i went home, was a trifling matter compared with the anxiety that i should have felt if the separation had been permanent at this moment when i felt a doubt about her before she had had time to become immaterial to me. at the moment when i pictured her thus to myself waiting for me at home, like a beloved wife who found the time of waiting long, and had perhaps fallen asleep for a moment in her room, i was caressed by the passage of a tender phrase, homely and domestic, of the septet. perhaps — everything is so interwoven and superimposed in our inward life — it had been inspired in vinteuil by his daughter’s sleep — his daughter, the cause to-day of all my troubles — when it enveloped in its quiet, on peaceful evenings, the work of the composer, this phrase which calmed me so, by the same soft background of silence which pacifies certain of schumann’s reveries, during which, even when ‘the poet is speaking,’ one can tell that ‘the child is asleep.’ asleep, awake, i should find her again this evening, when i chose to return home, albertine, my little child. and yet, i said to myself, something more mysterious than albertine’s love seemed to be promised at the outset of this work, in those first cries of dawn. i endeavoured to banish the thought of my mistress, so as to think only of the composer. indeed, he seemed to be present. one would have said that, reincarnate, the composer lived for all time in his music; one could feel the joy with which he was choosing the colour of some sound, harmonising it with the rest. for with other and more profound gifts vinteuil combined that which few composers, and indeed few painters have possessed, of using colours not merely so lasting but so personal that, just as time has been powerless to fade them, so the disciples who imitate him who discovered them, and even the masters who surpass him do not pale their originality. the revolution that their apparition has effected does not live to see its results merge unacknowledged in the work of subsequent generations; it is liberated, it breaks out again, and alone, whenever the innovator’s works are performed in all time to come. each note underlined itself in a colour which all the rules in the world could not have taught the most learned composers to imitate, with the result that vinteuil, albeit he had appeared at his hour and was fixed in his place in the evolution of music, would always leave that place to stand in the forefront, whenever any of his compositions was performed, which would owe its appearance of having blossomed after the works of other more recent composers to this quality, apparently paradoxical and actually deceiving, of permanent novelty. a page of symphonic music by vinteuil, familiar already on the piano, when one heard it rendered by an orchestra, like a ray of summer sunlight which the prism of the window disintegrates before it enters a dark dining-room, revealed like an unsuspected, myriad-hued treasure all the jewels of the arabian nights. but how can one compare to that motionless brilliance of light what was life, perpetual and blissful motion? this vinteuil, whom i had known so timid and sad, had been capable — when he had to select a tone, to blend another with it — of audacities, had enjoyed a good fortune, in the full sense of the word, as to which the hearing of any of his works left one in no doubt. the joy that such chords had aroused in him, the increase of strength that it had given him wherewith to discover others led the listener on also from one discovery to another, or rather it was the composer himself who guided him, deriving from the colours that he had invented a wild joy which gave him the strength to discover, to fling himself upon the others which they seemed to evoke, enraptured, quivering, as though from the shock of an electric spark, when the sublime came spontaneously to life at the clang of the brass, panting, drunken, maddened, dizzy, while he painted his great musical fresco, like michelangelo strapped to his scaffold and dashing, from his supine position, tumultuous brush-strokes upon the ceiling of the sistine chapel. vinteuil had been dead for many years; but in the sound of these instruments which he had animated, it had been given him to prolong, for an unlimited time, a part at least of his life. of his life as a man merely? if art was indeed but a prolongation of life, was it worth while to sacrifice anything to it, was it not as unreal as life itself? if i was to listen properly to this septet, i could not pause to consider the question. no doubt the glowing septet differed singularly from the candid sonata; the timid question to which the little phrase replied, from the breathless supplication to find the fulfilment of the strange promise that had resounded, so harsh, so supernatural, so brief, setting athrob the still inert crimson of the morning sky, above the sea. and yet these so widely different phrases were composed of the same elements, for just as there was a certain universe, perceptible by us in those fragments scattered here and there, in private houses, in public galleries, which were elstir’s universe, the universe which he saw, in which he lived, so to the music of vinteuil extended, note by note, key by key, the unknown colourings of an inestimable, unsuspected universe, made fragmentary by the gaps that occurred between the different occasions of hearing his work performed; those two so dissimilar questions which commanded the so different movements of the sonata and the septet, the former breaking into short appeals a line continuous and pure, the latter welding together into an indivisible structure a medley of scattered fragments, were nevertheless, one so calm and timid, almost detached and as though philosophic, the other so anxious, pressing, imploring, were nevertheless the same prayer, poured forth before different risings of the inward sun and merely refracted through the different mediums of other thoughts, of artistic researches carried on through the years in which he had tried to create something new. a prayer, a hope which was at heart the same, distinguishable beneath these disguises in the various works of vinteuil, and on the other hand not to be found elsewhere than in his works. for these phrases historians of music might indeed find affinities, a pedigree in the works of other great composers, but merely for subordinate reasons, from external resemblances, from analogies which were ingeniously discovered by reasoning rather than felt by a direct impression. the impression that these phrases of vinteuil imparted was different from any other, as though, notwithstanding the conclusions to which science seems to point, the individual did really exist. and it was precisely when he was seeking vigorously to be something new that one recognised beneath the apparent differences the profound similarities; and the deliberate resemblances that existed in the body of a work, when vinteuil repeated once and again a single phrase, diversified it, amused himself by altering its rhythm, by making it reappear in its original form, these deliberate resemblances, the work of the intellect, inevitably superficial, never succeeded in being as striking as those resemblances, concealed, involuntary, which broke out in different colours, between the two separate masterpieces; for then vinteuil, seeking to do something new, questioned himself, with all the force of his creative effort, reached his own essential nature at those depths, where, whatever be the question asked, it is in the same accent, that is to say its own, that it replies. such an accent, the accent of vinteuil, is separated from the accents of other composers by a difference far greater than that which we perceive between the voices of two people, even between the cries of two species of animal: by the difference that exists between the thoughts of those other composers and the eternal investigations of vinteuil, the question that he put to himself in so many forms, his habitual speculation, but as free from analytical formulas of reasoning as if it were being carried out in the world of the angels, so that we can measure its depth, but without being any more able to translate it into human speech than are disincarnate spirits when, evoked by a medium, he questions them as to the mysteries of death. and even when i bore in mind the acquired originality which had struck me that afternoon, that kinship which musical critics might discover among them, it is indeed a unique accent to which rise, and return in spite of themselves those great singers that original composers are, which is a proof of the irreducibly individual existence of the soul. though vinteuil might try to make more solemn, more grand, or to make more sprightly and gay what he saw reflected in the mind of his audience, yet, in spite of himself, he submerged it all beneath an undercurrent which makes his song eternal and at once recognisable. this song, different from those of other singers, similar to all his own, where had vinteuil learned, where had he heard it? each artist seems thus to be the native of an unknown country, which he himself has forgotten, different from that from which will emerge, making for the earth, another great artist. when all is said, vinteuil, in his latest works, seemed to have drawn nearer to that unknown country. the atmosphere was no longer the same as in the sonata, the questioning phrases became more pressing, more uneasy, the answers more mysterious; the clean-washed air of morning and evening seemed to influence even the instruments. morel might be playing marvellously, the sounds that came from his violin seemed to me singularly piercing, almost blatant. this harshness was pleasing, and, as in certain voices, one felt in it a sort of moral virtue and intellectual superiority. but this might give offence. when his vision of the universe is modified, purified, becomes more adapted to his memory of the country of his heart, it is only natural that this should be expressed by a general alteration of sounds in the musician, as of colours in the painter. anyhow, the more intelligent section of the public is not misled, since people declared later on that vinteuil’s last compositions were the most profound. now no programme, no subject supplied any intellectual basis for judgment. one guessed therefore that it was a question of transposition, an increasing profundity of sound     this lost country composers do not actually remember, but each of them remains all his life somehow attuned to it; he is wild with joy when he is singing the airs of his native land, betrays it at times in his thirst for fame, but then, in seeking fame, turns his back upon it, and it is only when he despises it that he finds it when he utters, whatever the subject with which he is dealing, that peculiar strain the monotony of which — for whatever its subject it remains identical in itself — proves the permanence of the elements that compose his soul. but is it not the fact then that from those elements, all the real residuum which we are obliged to keep to ourselves, which cannot be transmitted in talk, even by friend to friend, by master to disciple, by lover to mistress, that ineffable something which makes a difference in quality between what each of us has felt and what he is obliged to leave behind at the threshold of the phrases in which he can communicate with his fellows only by limiting himself to external points common to us all and of no interest, art, the art of a vinteuil like that of an elstir, makes the man himself apparent, rendering externally visible in the colours of the spectrum that intimate composition of those worlds which we call individual persons and which, without the aid of art, we should never know? a pair of wings, a different mode of breathing, which would enable us to traverse infinite space, would in no way help us, for, if we visited mars or venus keeping the same senses, they would clothe in the same aspect as the things of the earth everything that we should be capable of seeing. the only true voyage of discovery, the only fountain of eternal youth, would be not to visit strange lands but to possess other eyes, to behold the universe through the eyes of another, of a hundred others, to behold the hundred universes that each of them beholds, that each of them is; and this we can contrive with an elstir, with a vinteuil; with men like these we do really fly from star to star. the andante had just ended upon a phrase filled with a tenderness to which i had entirely abandoned myself; there followed, before the next movement, a short interval during which the performers laid down their instruments and the audience exchanged impressions. a duke, in order to shew that he knew what he was talking about, declared: “it is a difficult thing to play well.” other more entertaining people conversed for a moment with myself. but what were their words, which like every human and external word, left me so indifferent, compared with the heavenly phrase of music with which i had just been engaged? i was indeed like an angel who, fallen from the inebriating bliss of paradise, subsides into the most humdrum reality. and, just as certain creatures are the last surviving testimony to a form of life which nature has discarded, i asked myself if music were not the unique example of what might have been — if there had not come the invention of language, the formation of words, the analysis of ideas — the means of communication between one spirit and another. it is like a possibility which has ended in nothing; humanity has developed along other lines, those of spoken and written language. but this return to the unanalysed was so inebriating, that on emerging from that paradise, contact with people who were more or less intelligent seemed to me of an extraordinary insignificance. people — i had been able during the music to remember them, to blend them with it; or rather i had blended with the music little more than the memory of one person only, which was albertine. and the phrase that ended the andante seemed to me so sublime that i said to myself that it was a pity that albertine did not know it, and, had she known it, would not have understood what an honour it was to be blended with anything so great as this phrase which brought us together, and the pathetic voice of which she seemed to have borrowed. but, once the music was interrupted, the people who were present seemed utterly lifeless. refreshments were handed round. m. de charlus accosted a footman now and then with: “how are you? did you get my note? can you come?” no doubt there was in these remarks the freedom of the great nobleman who thinks he is flattering his hearer and is himself more one of the people than a man of the middle classes; there was also the cunning of the criminal who imagines that anything which he volunteers is on that account regarded as innocent. and he added, in the guermantes tone of mme. de villeparisis: “he’s a good young fellow, such a good sort, i often employ him at home.” but his adroitness turned against the baron, for people thought his intimate conversation and correspondence with footmen extraordinary. the footmen themselves were not so much flattered as embarrassed, in the presence of their comrades. meanwhile the septet had begun again and was moving towards its close; again and again one phrase or another from the sonata recurred, but always changed, its rhythm and harmony different, the same and yet something else, as things recur in life; and they were phrases of the sort which, without our being able to understand what affinity assigns to them as their sole and necessary home the past life of a certain composer, are to be found only in his work, and appear constantly in it, where they are the fairies, the dryads, the household gods; i had at the start distinguished in the septet two or three which reminded me of the sonata. presently — bathed in the violet mist which rose particularly in vinteuil’s later work, so much so that, even when he introduced a dance measure, it remained captive in the heart of an opal — i caught the sound of another phrase from the sonata, still hovering so remote that i barely recognised it; hesitating, it approached, vanished as though in alarm, then returned, joined hands with others, come, as i learned later on, from other works, summoned yet others which became in their turn attractive and persuasive, as soon as they were tamed, and took their places in the ring, a ring divine but permanently invisible to the bulk of the audience, who, having before their eyes only a thick veil through which they saw nothing, punctuated arbitrarily with admiring exclamations a continuous boredom which was becoming deadly. then they withdrew, save one which i saw reappear five times or six, without being able to distinguish its features, but so caressing, so different — as was no doubt the little phrase in swann’s sonata — from anything that any woman had ever made me desire, that this phrase which offered me in so sweet a voice a happiness which would really have been worth the struggle to obtain it, is perhaps — this invisible creature whose language i did not know and whom i understood so well — the only stranger that it has ever been my good fortune to meet. then this phrase broke up, was transformed, like the little phrase in the sonata, and became the mysterious appeal of the start. a phrase of a plaintive kind rose in opposition to it, but so profound, so vague, so internal, almost so organic and visceral that one could not tell at each of its repetitions whether they were those of a theme or of an attack of neuralgia. presently these two motives were wrestling together in a close fight in which now one disappeared entirely, and now the listener could catch only a fragment of the other. a wrestling match of energies only, to tell the truth; for if these creatures attacked one another, it was rid of their physical bodies, of their appearance, of their names, and finding in me an inward spectator, himself indifferent also to their names and to all details, interested only in their immaterial and dynamic combat and following with passion its sonorous changes. in the end the joyous motive was left triumphant; it was no longer an almost anxious appeal addressed to an empty sky, it was an ineffable joy which seemed to come from paradise, a joy as different from that of the sonata as from a grave and gentle angel by bellini, playing the theorbo, would be some archangel by mantegna sounding a trump. i might be sure that this new tone of joy, this appeal to a super-terrestrial joy, was a thing that i would never forget. but should i be able, ever, to realise it? this question seemed to me all the more important, inasmuch as this phrase was what might have seemed most definitely to characterise — from its sharp contrast with all the rest of my life, with the visible world — those impressions which at remote intervals i recaptured in my life as starting-points, foundation-stones for the construction of a true life: the impression that i had felt at the sight of the steeples of martinville, or of a line of trees near balbec. in any case, to return to the particular accent of this phrase, how strange it was that the presentiment most different from what life assigns to us on earth, the boldest approximation to the bliss of the world beyond should have been materialised precisely in the melancholy, respectable little old man whom we used to meet in the month of mary at combray; but, stranger still, how did it come about that this revelation, the strangest that i had yet received, of an unknown type of joy, should have come to me from him, since, it was understood, when he died he left nothing behind him but his sonata, all the rest being non-existent in indecipherable scribbljngs. indecipherable they may have been, but they had nevertheless been in the end deciphered, by dint of patience, intelligence and respect, by the only person who had lived sufficiently in vinteuil’s company to understand his method of working, to interpret his orchestral indications: mlle. vinteuil’s friend. even in the lifetime of the great composer, she had acquired from his daughter the reverence that the latter felt for her father. it was because of this reverence that, in those moments in which people run counter to their natural inclinations, the two girls had been able to find an insane pleasure in the profanations which have already been narrated. (her adoration of her father was the primary condition of his daughter’s sacrilege. and no doubt they ought to have foregone the delight of that sacrilege, but it did not express the whole of their natures.) and, what is more, the profanations had become rarefied until they disappeared altogether, in proportion as their morbid carnal relations, that troubled, smouldering fire, had given place to the flame of a pure and lofty friendship. mlle. vinteuil’s friend was sometimes worried by the importunate thought that she had perhaps hastened the death of vinteuil. at any rate, by spending years in poring over the cryptic scroll left by him, in establishing the correct reading of those illegible hieroglyphs, mlle. vinteuil’s friend had the consolation of assuring the composer whose grey hairs she had sent in sorrow to the grave an immortal and compensating glory. relations which are not consecrated by the laws establish bonds of kinship as manifold, as complex, even more solid than those which spring from marriage. indeed, without pausing to consider relations of so special a nature, do we not find every day that adultery, when it is based upon genuine love, does not upset the family sentiment, the duties of kinship, but rather revivifies them. adultery brings the spirit into what marriage would often have left a dead letter. a good-natured girl who merely from convention will wear mourning for her mother’s second husband has not tears enough to shed for the man whom her mother has chosen out of all the world as her lover. anyhow, mlle. vinteuil had acted only in a spirit of sadism, which did not excuse her, but it gave me a certain consolation to think so later on. she must indeed have realised, i told myself, at the moment when she and her friend profaned her father’s photograph, that what they were doing was merely morbidity, silliness, and not the true and joyous wickedness which she would have liked to feel. this idea that it was merely a pretence of wickedness spoiled her pleasure. but if this idea recurred to her mind later on, as it had spoiled her pleasure, so it must then have diminished her grief. “it was not i,” she must have told herself, “i was out of my mind. i myself mean still to pray for my father’s soul, not to despair of his forgiveness.” only it is possible that this idea, which had certainly presented itself to her in her pleasure, may not have presented itself in her grief. i would have liked to be able to put it into her mind. i am sure that i should have done her good and that i should have been able to reestablish between her and the memory of her father a pleasant channel of communication     as in the illegible note-books in which a chemist of genius, who does not know that death is at hand, jots down discoveries which will perhaps remain forever unknown, mlle. vinteuil’s friend had disentangled, from papers more illegible than strips of papyrus, dotted with a cuneiform script, the formula eternally true, forever fertile, of this unknown joy, the mystic hope of the crimson angel of the dawn. and i to whom, albeit not so much perhaps as to vinteuil, she had been also, she had been once more this very evening, by reviving afresh my jealousy of albertine, she was above all in the future to be the cause of so many sufferings, it was thanks to her, in compensation, that there had been able to come to my ears the strange appeal which i should never for a moment cease to hear, as the promise and proof that there existed something other, realisable no doubt by art, than the nullity that i had found in all my pleasures and in love itself, and that if my life seemed to me so empty, at least there were still regions unexplored     what she had enabled us, thanks to her labour, to know of vinteuil was, to tell the truth, the whole of vinteuil’s work. compared with this septet, certain phrases from the sonata which alone the public knew appeared so commonplace that one failed to understand how they could have aroused so much admiration. similarly we are surprised that for years past, pieces as trivial as the evening star or elisabeth’s prayer can have aroused in the concert-hall fanatical worshippers who wore themselves out in applause and in crying encore at the end of what after all is poor and trite to us who know tristan, the rheingold and themeistersinger. we are left to suppose that those featureless melodies contained already nevertheless in infinitesimal, and for that reason, perhaps, more easily assimilable quantities, something of the originality of the masterpieces which, in retrospect, are alone of importance to us, but which their very perfection may perhaps have prevented from being understood; they have been able to prepare the way for them in our hearts. anyhow it is true that, if they gave a confused presentiment of the beauties to come, they left these in a state of complete obscurity. it was the same with vinteuil; if at his death he had left behind him — excepting certain parts of the sonata — only what he had been able to complete, what we should have known of him would have been, in relation to his true greatness, as little as, in the case of, say, victor hugo, if he had died after the pas d’armes du roi jean, the fiancée du timbalier and sarah la baigneuse, without having written a line of the légende des siècles or the contemplations: what is to us his real work would have remained purely potential, as unknown as those universes to which our perception does not attain, of which we shall never form any idea     anyhow, the apparent contrast, that profound union between genius (talent too and even virtue) and the sheath of vices in which, as had happened in the case of vinteuil, it is so frequently contained, preserved, was legible, as in a popular allegory, in the mere assembly of the guests among whom i found myself once again when the music had come to an end. this assembly, albeit limited this time to mme. verdurin’s drawing-room, resembled many others, the ingredients of which are unknown to the general public, and which philosophical journalists, if they are at all well-informed, call parisian, or panamist, or dreyfusard, never suspecting that they may equally well be found in petersburg, berlin, madrid, and at every epoch; if as a matter of fact the under secretary of state for fine arts, an artist to his fingertips, well-bred and smart, several duchesses and three ambassadors with their wives were present this evening at mme. verdurin’s, the proximate, immediate cause of their presence lay in the relations that existed between m. de charlus and morel, relations which made the baron anxious to give as wide a celebrity as possible to the artistic triumphs of his young idol, and to obtain for him the cross of the legion of honour; the remoter cause which had made this assembly possible was that a girl living with mlle. vinteuil in the same way as the baron was living with charlie had brought to light a whole series of works of genius which had been such a revelation that before long a subscription was to be opened under the patronage of the minister of education, with the object of erecting a statue of vinteuil. moreover, these works had been assisted, no less than by mlle. vinteuil’s relations with her friend, by the baron’s relations with charlie, a sort of cross-road, a short cut, thanks to which the world was enabled to overtake these works without the preliminary circuit, if not of a want of comprehension which would long persist, at least of a complete ignorance which might have lasted for years. whenever an event occurs which is within the range of the vulgar mind of the moralising journalist, a political event as a rule, the moralising journalists are convinced that there has been some great change in france, that we shall never see such evenings again, that no one will ever again admire ibsen, renan, dostoïevski, d’annunzio, tolstoi, wagner, strauss. for moralising journalists take their text from the equivocal undercurrents of these official manifestations, in order to find something decadent in the art which is there celebrated and which as often as not is more austere than any other. but there is no name among those most revered by these moralising journalists which has not quite naturally given rise to some such strange gathering, although its strangeness may have been less flagrant and better concealed. in the case of this gathering, the impure elements that associated themselves with it struck me from another aspect; to be sure, i was as well able as anyone to dissociate them, having learned to know them separately, but anyhow it came to pass that some of them, those which concerned mlle. vinteuil and her friend, speaking to me of combray, spoke to me also of albertine, that is to say of balbec, since it was because i had long ago seen mlle. vinteuil at montjouvain and had learned of her friend’s intimacy with albertine, that i was presently, when i returned home, to find, instead of solitude, albertine awaiting me, and that the others, those which concerned morel and m. de charlus, speaking to me of balbec, where i had seen, on the platform at doncières, their intimacy begin, spoke to me of combray and of its two ‘ways,’ for m. de charlus was one of those guermantes, counts of combray, inhabiting combray without having any dwelling there, between earth and heaven, like gilbert the bad in his window: while, after all, morel was the son of that old valet who had enabled me to know the lady in pink, and had permitted me, years after, to identify her with mme. swann     m. de charlus repeated, when, the music at an end, his guests came, to say good-bye to him, the same error that he had made when they arrived. he did not ask them to shake hands with their hostess, to include her and her husband in the gratitude that was being showered on himself. there was a long queue waiting, but a queue that led to the baron alone, a fact of which he must have been conscious, for as he said to me a little later: “the form of the artistic celebration ended in a ‘few-words-in-the-vestry’ touch that was quite amusing.” the guests even prolonged their expressions of gratitude with indiscriminate remarks which enabled them to remain for a moment longer in the baron’s presence, while those who had not yet congratulated him on the success of his party hung wearily in the rear. a stray husband or two may have announced his intention of going; but his wife, a snob as well as a duchess, protested: “no, no, even if we are kept waiting an hour, we cannot go away without thanking palamède, who has taken so much trouble. there is nobody else left now who can give entertainments like this.” nobody would have thought of asking to be introduced to mme. verdurin any more than to the attendant in a theatre to which some great lady has for one evening brought the whole aristocracy. “were you at eliane de montmorency’s yesterday, cousin?” asked mme. de mortemart, seeking an excuse to prolong their conversation. “good gracious, no; i like eliane, but i never can understand her invitations. i must be very stupid, i’m afraid,” he went on, parting his lips in a broad smile, while mme. de mortemart realised that she was to be made the first recipient of ‘one of palamède’s’ as she had often been of ‘one of oriane’s.’“i did indeed receive a card a fortnight ago from the charming eliane. above the questionably authentic name of ‘montmorency’ was the following kind invitation: ‘my dear cousin, will you please remember me next friday at half-past nine.’ beneath were written two less gratifying words: ‘czech quartet.’ these seemed to me incomprehensible, and in any case to have no more connexion with the sentence above than the words ‘my dear ——-,’ which you find on the back of a letter, with nothing else after them, when the writer has already begun again on the other side, and has not taken a fresh sheet, either from carelessness or in order to save paper. i am fond of eliane: and so i felt no annoyance, i merely ignored the strange and inappropriate allusion to a czech quartet, and, as i am a methodical man, i placed on my chimney-piece the invitation to remember madame de montmorency on friday at half-past nine. although renowned for my obedient, punctual and meek nature, as buffon says of the camel”— at this, laughter seemed to radiate from m. de charlus who knew that on the contrary he was regarded as the most impossible person to live with —“i was a few minutes late (it took me a few minutes to change my clothes), and without any undue remorse, thinking that half-past nine meant ten, at the stroke of ten in a comfortable dressing-gown, with warm slippers on my feet, i sat down in my chimney corner to remember eliane as she had asked me and with a concentration which began to relax only at half-past ten. tell her please that i complied strictly with her audacious request. i am sure she will be gratified.” mme. de mortemart was helpless with laughter, in which m. de charlus joined. “and to-morrow,” she went on, forgetting that she had already long exceeded the time that might be allotted to her, “are you going to our la rochefoucauld cousins?” “oh, that, now, is quite impossible, they have invited me, and you too, i see, to a thing it is utterly impossible to imagine, which is called, if i am to believe their card of invitation, a ‘dancing tea.’ i used to be considered pretty nimble when i was young, but i doubt whether i could ever decently have drunk a cup of tea while i was dancing. no, i have never cared for eating or drinking in unnatural positions. you will remind me that my dancing days are done. but even sitting down comfortably to drink my tea — of the quality of which i am suspicious since it is called ‘dancing’— i should be afraid lest other guests younger than myself, and less nimble possibly than i was at their age, might spill their cups over my clothes which would interfere with my pleasure in draining my own.” nor indeed was m. de charlus content with leaving mme. verdurin out of the conversation while he spoke of all manner of subjects which he seemed to be taking pleasure in developing and varying, that cruel pleasure which he had always enjoyed of keeping indefinitely on their feet the friends who were waiting with an excruciating patience for their turn to come; he even criticised all that part of the entertainment for which mme. verdurin was responsible. “but, talking about cups, what in the world are those strange little bowls which remind me of the vessels in which, when i was a young man, people used to get sorbets from poiré-blanche. somebody said to me just now that they were for ‘iced coffee.’ but if it comes to that, i have seen neither coffee nor ice. what curious little objects — so very ambiguous.” in saying this m. de charlus had placed his white-gloved hands vertically over his lips and had modestly circumscribed his indicative stare as though he were afraid of being heard, or even seen by his host and hostess. but this was a mere feint, for in a few minutes he would be offering the same criticisms to the mistress herself, and a little later would be insolently enjoining: “no more iced-coffee cups, remember! give them to one of your friends whose house you wish to disfigure. but warn her not to have them in the drawing-room, or people might think that they had come into the wrong room, the things are so exactly like chamberpots.” “but, cousin,” said the guest, lowering her own voice also, and casting a questioning glance at m. de charlus, for she was afraid of offending not mme. verdurin but him, “perhaps she doesn’t quite know yet. . . . ” “she shall be taught.” “oh!” laughed the guest, “she couldn’t have a better teacher! she is lucky! if you are in charge, one can be sure there won’t be a false note.” “there wasn’t one, if it comes to that, in the music.” “oh! it was sublime. one of those pleasures which can never be forgotten. talking of that marvellous violinist,” she went on, imagining in her innocence that m. de charlus was interested in the violin ‘pure and simple,’“do you happen to know one whom i heard the other day playing too wonderfully a sonata by fauré, his name is frank. . . . ” “oh, he’s a horror,” replied m. de charlus, overlooking the rudeness of a contradiction which implied that his cousin was lacking in taste. “as far as violinists are concerned, i advise you to confine yourself to mine.” this paved the way to a fresh exchange of glances, at once furtive and scrutinous, between m. de charlus and his cousin, for, blushing and seeking by her zeal to atone for her blunder, mme. de mortemart went on to suggest to m. de charlus that she might give a party, to hear morel play. now, so far as she was concerned, this party had not the object of bringing an unknown talent into prominence, an object which she would, however, pretend to have in mind, and which was indeed that of m. de charlus. she regarded it only as an opportunity for giving a particularly smart party and was calculating already whom she would invite and whom she would reject. this business of selection, the chief preoccupation of people who give parties (even the people whom ‘society’ journalists are so impudent or so foolish as to call ‘the élite’), alters at once the expression — and the handwriting — of a hostess more profoundly than any hypnotic suggestion. before she had even thought of what morel was to play (which she regarded, and rightly, as a secondary consideration, for even if everybody this evening, from fear of m. de charlus, had observed a polite silence during the music, it would never have occurred to anyone to listen to it), mme. de mortemart, having decided that mme. de valcourt was not to be one of the elect, had automatically assumed that air of conspiracy, of a secret plotting which so degrades even those women in society who can most easily afford to ignore what ‘people will say.’“wouldn’t it be possible for me to give a party, for people to hear your friend play?” murmured mme. de mortemart, who, while addressing herself exclusively to m. de charlus, could not refrain, as though under a fascination, from casting a glance at mme. de valcourt (the rejected) in order to make certain that the other was too far away to hear her. “no she cannot possibly hear what i am saying,” mme. de mortemart concluded inwardly, reassured by her own glance which as a matter of fact had had a totally different effect upon mme. de valcourt from that intended: “why,” mme. de valcourt had said to herself when she caught this glance, “marie-thérèse is planning something with palamède which i am not to be told.” “you mean my protégé,” m. de charlus corrected, as merciless to his cousin’s choice of words as he was to her musical endowments. then without paying the slightest attention to her silent prayers, as she made a smiling apology: “why, yes . . . ” he said in a loud tone, audible throughout the room, “although there is always a risk in that sort of exportation of a fascinating personality into surroundings that must inevitably diminish his transcendent gifts and would in any case have to be adapted to them.” madame de mortemart told herself that the aside, the pianissimo of her question had been a waste of trouble, after the megaphone through which the answer had issued. she was mistaken. mme. de valcourt heard nothing, for the simple reason that she did not understand a single word. her anxiety diminished and would rapidly have been extinguished had not mme. de mortemart, afraid that she might have been given away and afraid of having to invite mme. de valcourt, with whom she was on too intimate terms to be able to leave her out if the other knew about her party beforehand, raised her eyelids once again in edith’s direction, as though not to lose sight of a threatening peril, lowering them again briskly so as not to commit herself. she intended, on the morning after the party, to write her one of those letters, the complement of the revealing glance, letters which people suppose to be subtle and which are tantamount to a full and signed confession. for instance: “dear edith, i am so sorry about you, i did not really expect you last night” (“how could she have expected me,” edith would ask herself, “since she never invited me?”) “as i know that you are not very fond of parties of that sort, which rather bore you. we should have been greatly honoured, all the same, by your company” (never did mme. de mortemart employ the word ‘honoured,’ except in the letters in which she attempted to cloak a lie in the semblance of truth). “you know that you are always at home in our house, however, you were quite right, as it was a complete failure, like everything that is got up at a moment’s notice.” but already the second furtive glance darted at her had enabled edith to grasp everything that was concealed by the complicated language of m. de charlus. this glance was indeed so violent that, after it had struck mme. de valcourt, the obvious secrecy and mischievous intention that it embodied rebounded upon a young peruvian whom mme. de mortemart intended, on the contrary, to invite. but being of a suspicious nature, seeing all too plainly the mystery that was being made without realising that it was not intended to mystify him, he at once conceived a violent hatred of mme. de mortemart and determined to play all sorts of tricks upon her, such as ordering fifty iced coffees to be sent to her house on a day when she was not giving a party, or, when she was, inserting a paragraph in the newspapers announcing that the party was postponed, and publishing false reports of her other parties, in which would figure the notorious names of all the people whom, for various reasons, a hostess does not invite or even allow to be introduced to her. mme. de mortemart need not have bothered herself about mme. de valcourt. m. de charlus was about to spoil, far more effectively than the other’s presence could spoil it, the projected party. “but, my dear cousin,” she said in response to the expression ‘adapting the surroundings,’ the meaning of which her momentary state of hyperaesthesia had enabled her to discern, “we shall save you all the trouble. i undertake to ask gilbert to arrange everything.” “not on any account, all the more as he must not be invited to it. nothing can be arranged except by myself. the first thing is to exclude all the people who have ears and hear not.” m. de charlus’s cousin, who had been reckoning upon morel as an attraction in order to give a party at which she could say that, unlike so many of her kinswomen, she had ‘had palamède,’ carried her thoughts abruptly, from this prestige of m. de charlus, to all sorts of people with whom he would get her into trouble if he began interfering with the list of her guests. the thought that the prince de guermantes (on whose account, partly, she was anxious to exclude mme. de valcourt, whom he declined to meet) was not to be invited, alarmed her. her eyes assumed an uneasy expression. “is the light, which is rather too strong, hurting you?” inquired m. de charlus with an apparent seriousness the underlying irony of which she failed to perceive. “no, not at all, i was thinking of the difficulty, not for myself of course, but for my family, if gilbert were to hear that i had given a party without inviting him, when he never has a cat on his housetop without. . . . ” “why of course, we must begin by eliminating the cat on the housetop, which could only miaow; i suppose that the din of talk has prevented you from realising that it was a question not of doing the civilities of a hostess but of proceeding to the rites customary at every true celebration.” then, deciding, not that the next person had been kept waiting too long, but that it did not do to exaggerate the favours shewn to one who had in mind not so much morel as her own visiting-list, m. de charlus, like a physician who cuts short a consultation when he considers that it has lasted long enough, gave his cousin a signal to withdraw, not by bidding her good night but by turning to the person immediately behind her. “good evening, madame de montesquieu, marvellous, wasn’t it? i have not seen hélène, tell her that every general abstention, even the most noble, that is to say her own, must include exceptions, if they are brilliant, as has been the case to-night. to shew that one is rare is all very well, but to subordinate one’s rarity, which is only negative, to what is precious is better still. in your sister’s case, and i value more than anyone her systematic absence from places where what is in store for her is not worthy of her, here to-night, on the contrary, her presence at so memorable an exhibition as this would have been aprésidence, and would have given your sister, already so distinguished, an additional distinction.” then he turned to a third person, m. d’argencourt. i was greatly astonished to see in this room, as friendly and flattering towards m. de charlus as he was severe with him elsewhere, insisting upon morel’s being introduced to him and telling him that he hoped he would come and see him, m. d’argencourt, that terrible scourge of men such as m. de charlus. at the moment he was living in the thick of them. it was certainly not because he had in any sense become one of them himself. but for some time past he had practically deserted his wife for a young woman in society whom he adored. being intelligent herself, she made him share her taste for intelligent people, and was most anxious to have m. de charlus in her house. but above all m. d’argencourt, extremely jealous and not unduly potent, feeling that he was failing to satisfy his captive and anxious at once to introduce her to people and to keep her amused, could do so without risk to himself only by surrounding her with innocuous men, whom he thus cast for the part of guardians of his seraglio. these men found that he had become quite pleasant and declared that he was a great deal more intelligent than they had supposed, a discovery that delighted him and his mistress     the remainder of m. de charlus’s guests drifted away fairly rapidly. several of them said: “i don’t want to call at the vestry” (the little room in which the baron, with charlie by his side, was receiving congratulations, and to which he himself had given the name), “but i must let palamède see me so that he shall know that i stayed to the end.” nobody paid the slightest attention to mme. verdurin. some pretended not to know which was she and said good night by mistake to mme. cottard, appealing to me for confirmation with a “that is mme. verdurin, ain’t it?” mme. d’arpajon asked me, in the hearing of our hostess: “tell me, has there ever been a monsieur verdurin?” the duchesses, finding none of the oddities that they expected in this place which they had hoped to find more different from anything that they already knew, made the best of a bad job by going into fits of laughter in front of elstir’s paintings; for all the rest of the entertainment, which they found more in keeping than they had expected with the style with which they were familiar, they gave the credit to m. de charlus, saying: “how clever palamède is at arranging things; if he were to stage an opera in a stable or a bathroom, it would still be perfectly charming.” the most noble ladies were those who shewed most fervour in congratulating m. de charlus upon the success of a party, of the secret motive of which some of them were by no means unaware, without, however, being embarrassed by the knowledge, this class of society — remembering perhaps certain epochs in history when their own family had already arrived at an identical stage of brazenly conscious effrontery — carrying their contempt for scruples almost as far as their respect for etiquette. several of them engaged charlie on the spot for different evenings on which he was to come and play them vinteuil’s septet, but it never occurred to any of them to invite mme. verdurin. this last was already blind with fury when m. de charlus who, his head in the clouds, was incapable of perceiving her condition, decided that it would be only decent to invite the mistress to share his joy. and it was perhaps yielding to his literary preciosity rather than to an overflow of pride that this specialist in artistic entertainments said to mme. verdurin: “well, are you satisfied? i think you have reason to be; you see that when i set to work to give a party there are no half-measures. i do not know whether your heraldic knowledge enables you to gauge the precise importance of the display, the weight that i have lifted, the volume of air that i have displaced for you. you have had the queen of naples, the brother of the king of bavaria, the three premier peers. if vinteuil is mahomet, we may say that we have brought to him some of the least movable of mountains. bear in mind that to attend your party the queen of naples has come up from neuilly, which is a great deal more difficult for her than evacuating the two sicilies,” he went on, with a deliberate sneer, notwithstanding his admiration for the queen. “it is an historic event. just think that it is perhaps the first time she has gone anywhere since the fall of gaeta. it is probable that the dictionaries of dates will record as culminating points the day of the fall of gaeta and that of the verdurins’ party. the fan that she laid down, the better to applaud vinteuil, deserves to become more famous than the fan that mme. de metternich broke because the audience hissed wagner.” “why, she has left it here,” said mme. verdurin, momentarily appeased by the memory of the queen’s kindness to herself, and she shewed m. de charlus the fan which was lying upon a chair. “oh! what a touching spectacle!” exclaimed m. de charlus, approaching the relic with veneration. “it is all the more touching, it is so hideous; poor little violette is incredible!” and spasms of emotion and irony coursed through him alternately. “oh dear, i don’t know whether you feel this sort of thing as i do. swann would positively have died of convulsions if he had seen it. i am sure, whatever price it fetches, i shall buy the fan at the queen’s sale. for she is bound to be sold up, she hasn’t a penny,” he went on, for he never ceased to intersperse the cruellest slanders with the most sincere veneration, albeit these sprang from two opposing natures, which, however, were combined in himself. they might even be brought to bear alternately upon the same incident. for m. de charlus who in his comfortable state as a wealthy man ridiculed the poverty of the queen was himself often to be heard extolling that poverty and, when anyone spoke of princesse murât, queen of the two sicilies, would reply: “i do not know to whom you are alluding. there is only one queen of naples, who is a sublime person and does not keep a carriage. but from her omnibus she annihilates every vehicle on the street and one could kneel down in the dust on seeing her drive past.” “i shall bequeath it to a museum. in the meantime, it must be sent back to her, so that she need not hire a cab to come and fetch it. the wisest thing, in view of the historical interest of such an object, would be to steal the fan. but that would be awkward for her — since it is probable that she does not possess another!” he added, with a shout of laughter. “anyhow, you see that for my sake she came. and that is not the only miracle that i have performed. i do not believe that anyone at the present day has the power to move the people whom i have brought here. however, everyone must be given his due. charlie and the rest of the musicians played divinely. and, my dear mistress,” he added condescendingly, “you yourself have played your part on this occasion. your name will not be unrecorded. history has preserved that of the page who armed joan of arc when she set out for battle; indeed you have served as a connecting link, you have made possible the fusion between vinteuil’s music and its inspired interpreter, you have had the intelligence to appreciate the capital importance of the whole chain of circumstances which would enable the interpreter to benefit by the whole weight of a considerable — if i were not referring to myself, i would say providential — personage, whom you were clever enough to ask to ensure the success of the gathering, to bring before morel’s violin the ears directly attached to the tongues that have the widest hearing; no, no, it is not a small matter. there can be no small matter in so complete a realisation. everything has its part. the duras was marvellous. in fact, everything; that is why,” he concluded, for he loved to administer a rebuke, “i set my face against your inviting those persons — divisors who, among the overwhelming people whom i brought you would have played the part of the decimal points in a sum, reducing the others to a merely fractional value. i have a very exact appreciation of that sort of thing. you understand, we must avoid blunders when we are giving a party which ought to be worthy of vinteuil, of his inspired interpreter, of yourself, and, i venture to say, of me. you were prepared to invite the molé, and everything would have been spoiled. it would have been the little contrary, neutralising drop which deprives a potion of its virtue. the electric lights would have fused, the pastry would not have come in time, the orangeade would have given everybody a stomachache. she was the one person not to invite. at the mere sound of her name, as in a fairy-tale, not a note would have issued from the brass; the flute and the hautboy would have been stricken with a sudden silence. morel himself, even if he had succeeded in playing a few bars, would not have been in tune, and instead of vinteuil’s septet you would have had a parody of it by beckmesser, ending amid catcalls. i, who believe strongly in personal influence, could feel quite plainly in the expansion of a certain largo, which opened itself right out like a flower, in the supreme satisfaction of the finale, which was not merely allegro but incomparably allegro, that the absence of the molé was inspiring the musicians and was diffusing joy among the very instruments themselves. in any case, when one is at home to queens one does not invite one’s hall-portress.” in calling her ‘the molé’ (as for that matter he said quite affectionately ‘the duras’) m. de charlus was doing the lady justice. for all these women were the actresses of society and it is true also that, even regarding her from this point of view, comtesse molé did not justify the extraordinary reputation for intelligence that she had acquired, which made one think of those mediocre actors or novelists who, at certain periods, are hailed as men of genius, either because of the mediocrity of their competitors, among whom there is no artist capable of revealing what is meant by true talent, or because of the mediocrity of the public, which, did there exist an extraordinary individuality, would be incapable of understanding it. in mme. molé‘s case it is preferable, if not absolutely fair, to stop at the former explanation. the social world being the realm of nullity, there exist between the merits of women in society only insignificant degrees, which are at best capable of rousing to madness the rancours or the imagination of m. de charlus. and certainly, if he spoke as he had just been speaking in this language which was a precious alloy of artistic and social elements, it was because his old-womanly anger and his culture as a man of the world furnished the genuine eloquence that he possessed with none but insignificant themes. since the world of differences does not exist on the surface of the earth, among all the countries which our perception renders uniform, all the more reason why it should not exist in the social ‘world.’ does it exist anywhere else? vinteuil’s septet had seemed to tell me that it did. but where? as m. de charlus also enjoyed repeating what one person had said of another, seeking to stir up quarrels, to divide and reign, he added: “you have, by not inviting her, deprived mme. molé of the opportunity of saying: ‘i can’t think why this mme. verdurin should invite me. i can’t imagine who these people are, i don’t know them.’ she was saying a year ago that you were boring her with your advances. she’s a fool, never invite her again. after all, she’s nothing so very wonderful. she can come to your house without making a fuss about it, seeing that i come here. in short,” he concluded, “it seems to me that you have every reason to thank me, for, so far as it went, everything has been perfect. the duchesse de guermantes did not come, but one can’t tell, it was better perhaps that she didn’t. we shan’t bear her any grudge, and we shall remember her all the same another time, not that one can help remembering her, her very eyes say to us ‘forget me not!’, for they are a pair of myosotes” (here i thought to myself how strong the guermantes spirit — the decision to go to one house and not to another — must be, to have outweighed in the duchess’s mind her fear of palamède). “in the face of so complete a success, one is tempted like bernardin de saint-pierre to see everywhere the hand of providence. the duchesse de duras was enchanted. she even asked me to tell you so,” added m. de charlus, dwelling upon the words as though mme. verdurin must regard this as a sufficient honour. sufficient and indeed barely credible, for he found it necessary, if he was to be believed, to add, completely carried away by the madness of those whom jupiter has decided to ruin: “she has engaged morel to come to her house, where the same programme will be repeated, and i even think of asking her for an invitation for m. verdurin.” this civility to the husband alone was, although no such idea even occurred to m. de charlus, the most wounding outrage to the wife who, believing herself to possess, with regard to the violinist, by virtue of a sort of ukase which prevailed in the little clan, the right to forbid him to perform elsewhere without her express authorisation, was fully determined to forbid his appearance at mme. de duras’s party     the baron’s volubility was in itself an irritation to mme. verdurin who did not like people to form independent groups within their little clan. how often, even at la raspelière, hearing m. de charlus talking incessantly to charlie instead of being content with taking his part in the so harmonious chorus of the clan, she had pointed to him and exclaimed: “what a rattle   he is! what a rattle! oh, if it comes to rattles, he’s a famous rattle!” but this time it was far worse. inebriated with the sound of his own voice, m. de charlus failed to realise that by cutting down the part assigned to mme. verdurin and confining it within narrow limits, he was calling forth that feeling of hatred which was in her only a special, social form of jealousy. mme. verdurin was genuinely fond of her regular visitors, the faithful of the little clan, but wished them to be entirely devoted to their mistress. willing to make some sacrifice, like those jealous lovers who will tolerate a betrayal, but only under their own roof and even before their eyes, that is to say when there is no betrayal, she would allow the men to have mistresses, lovers, on condition that the affair had no social consequence outside her own house, that the tie was formed and perpetuated in the shelter of her wednesdays. in the old days, every furtive peal of laughter that came from odette when she conversed with swann had gnawed her heartstrings, and so of late had every aside exchanged by morel and the baron; she found one consolation alone for her griefs which was to destroy the happiness of other people. she had not been able to endure for long that of the baron. and here was this rash person precipitating the catastrophe by appearing to be restricting the mistress’s place in her little clan. already she could see morel going into society, without her, under the baron’s aegis. there was but a single remedy, to make morel choose between the baron and herself, and, relying upon the ascendancy that she had acquired over morel by the display that she made of an extraordinary perspicacity, thanks to reports which she collected, to falsehoods which she invented, all of which served to corroborate what he himself was led to believe, and what would in time be made plain to him, thanks to the pitfalls which she was preparing, into which her unsuspecting victims would fall, relying upon this ascendancy, to make him choose herself in preference to the baron. as for the society ladies who had been present and had not even asked to be introduced to her, as soon as she grasped their hesitations or indifference, she had said: “ah! i see what they are, the sort of old good-for-nothings that are not our style, it’s the last time they shall set foot in this house.” for she would have died rather than admit that anyone had been less friendly to her than she had hoped. “ah! my dear general,” m. de charlus suddenly exclaimed, abandoning mme. verdurin, as he caught sight of general deltour, secretary to the president of the republic, who might be of great value in securing charlie his cross, and who, after asking some question of cottard, was rapidly withdrawing: “good evening, my dear, delightful friend. so this is how you slip away without saying good-bye to me,” said the baron with a genial, self-satisfied smile, for he knew quite well that people were always glad to stay behind for a moment to talk to himself. and as, in his present state of excitement, he would answer his own questions in a shrill tone: “well, did you enjoy it? wasn’t it really fine? the andante, what? it’s the most touching thing that was ever written. i defy anyone to listen to the end without tears in his eyes. charming of you to have come. listen, i had the most perfect telegram this morning from froberville, who tells me that as far as the grand chancery goes the difficulties have been smoothed away, as the saying is.” m. de charlus’s voice continued to soar at this piercing pitch, as different from his normal voice as is that of a barrister making an emphatic plea from his ordinary utterance, a phenomenon of vocal amplification by over-excitement and nervous tension analogous to that which, at her own dinner-parties, raised to so high a diapason the voice and gaze alike of mme. de guermantes. “i intended to send you a note to-morrow by a messenger to tell you of my enthusiasm, until i could find an opportunity of speaking to you, but you have been so surrounded! froberville’s support is not to be despised, but for my own part, i have the minister’s promise,” said the general. “ah! excellent. besides, you have seen for yourself that it is only what such talent deserves. hoyos was delighted, i didn’t manage to see the ambassadress, was she pleased? who would not have been, except those that have ears and hear not, which does not matter so long as they have tongues and can speak.” taking advantage of the baron’s having withdrawn to speak to the general, mme. verdurin made a signal to brichot. he, not knowing what mme. verdurin was going to say, sought to amuse her, and never suspecting the anguish that he was causing me, said to the mistress: “the baron is delighted that mlle. vinteuil and her friend did not come. they shock him terribly. he declares that their morals are appalling. you can’t imagine how prudish and severe the baron is on moral questions.” contrary to brichot’s expectation, mme. verdurin was not amused: “he is obscene,” was her answer. “take him out of the room to smoke a cigarette with you, so that my husband can get hold of his dulcinea without his noticing it and warn him of the abyss that is yawning at his feet.” brichot seemed to hesitate. “i don’t mind telling you,” mme. verdurin went on, to remove his final scruples, “that i do not feel at all safe with a man like that in the house. i know, there are all sorts of horrible stories about him, and the police have him under supervision.” and, as she possessed a certain talent of improvisation when inspired by malice, mme. verdurin did not stop at this: “it seems, he has been in prison. yes, yes, i have been told by people who knew all about it. i know, too, from a person who lives in his street, that you can’t imagine the ruffians that go to his house.” and as brichot, who often went to the baron’s, began to protest, mme. verdurin, growing animated, exclaimed: “but i can assure you! it is i who am telling you,” an expression with which she habitually sought to give weight to an assertion flung out more or less at random. “he will be found murdered in his bed one of these days, as those people always are. he may not go quite as far as that perhaps, because he is in the clutches of that jupien whom he had the impudence to send to me, and who is an ex-convict, i know it, you yourself know it, yes, for certain. he has a hold on him because of some letters which are perfectly appalling, it seems. i know it from somebody who has seen them, and told me: ‘you would be sick on the spot if you saw them.’ that is how jupien makes him toe the line and gets all the money he wants out of him. i would sooner die a thousand times over than live in a state of terror like charlus. in any case, if morel’s family decides to bring an action against him, i have no desire to be dragged in as an accomplice. if he goes on, it will be at his own risk, but i shall have done my duty. what is one to do? it’s no joke, i can tell you.” and, agreeably warmed already by the thought of her husband’s impending conversation with the violinist, mme. verdurin said to me: “ask brichot whether i am not a courageous friend, and whether i am not capable of sacrificing myself to save my comrades.” (she was alluding to the circumstances in which she had, just in time, made him quarrel, first of all with his laundress, and then with mme. de cambremer, quarrels as a result of which brichot had become almost completely blind, and   had taken to morphia.) “an incomparable friend, far-sighted and valiant,” replied the professor with an innocent emotion. “mme. verdurin prevented me from doing something extremely foolish,” brichot told me when she had left us. “she never hesitates to operate without anaesthetics. she is an interventionist, as our friend cottard says. i admit, however, that the thought that the poor baron is still unconscious of the blow that is going to fall upon him distresses me deeply. he is quite mad about that boy. if mme. verdurin should prove successful, there is a man who is going to be very miserable. however, it is not certain that she will not fail. i am afraid that she may only succeed in creating a misunderstanding between them, which, in the end, without parting them, will only make them quarrel with her.” it was often thus with mme. verdurin and her faithful. but it was evident that in her the need to preserve their friendship was more and more dominated by the requirement that this friendship should never be challenged by that which they might feel for one another. homosexuality did not disgust her so long as it did not tamper with orthodoxy, but like the church she preferred any sacrifice rather than a concession of orthodoxy. i was beginning to be afraid lest her irritation with myself might be due to her having heard that i had prevented albertine from going to her that afternoon, and that she might presently set to work, if she had not already begun, upon the same task of separating her from me which her husband, in the case of charlus, was now going to attempt with the musician. “come along, get hold of charlus, find some excuse, there’s no time to lose,” said mme. verdurin, “and whatever you do, don’t let him come back here until i send for you. oh! what an evening,” mme. verdurin went on, revealing thus the true cause of her anger. “performing a masterpiece in front of those wooden images. i don’t include the queen of naples, she is intelligent, she is a nice woman” (which meant: “she has been kind to me”). “but the others. oh! it’s enough to drive anyone mad. what can you expect, i’m no longer a girl. when i was young, people told me that one must put up with boredom, i made an effort, but now, oh no, it’s too much for me, i am old enough to please myself, life is too short; bore myself, listen to idiots, smile, pretend to think them intelligent. no, i can’t do it. get along, brichot, there’s no time to lose.” “i am going, madame, i am going,” said brichot, as general deltour moved away. but first of all the professor took me aside for a moment: “moral duty,” he said, “is less clearly imperative than our ethics teach us. whatever the theosophical cafés and the kantian beer-houses may say, we are deplorably ignorant of the nature of good. i myself who, without wishing to boast, have lectured to my pupils, in all innocence, upon the philosophy of the said immanuel kant, i can see no precise ruling for the case of social casuistry with which i am now confronted in that critique of practical reason in which the great renegade of protestantism platonised in the german manner for a germany prehistorically sentimental and aulic, ringing all the changes of a pomeranian mysticism. it is still the symposium, but held this time at kônigsberg, in the local style, indigestible and reeking of sauerkraut, and without any good-looking boys. it is obvious on the one hand that i cannot refuse our excellent hostess the small service that she asks of me, in a fully orthodox conformity with traditional morals. one ought to avoid, above all things, for there are few that involve one in more foolish speeches, letting oneself be lured by words. but after all, let us not hesitate to admit that if the mothers of families were entitled to vote, the baron would run the risk of being lamentably blackballed for the chair of virtue. it is unfortunately with the temperament of a rake that he pursues the vocation of a pedagogue; observe that i am not speaking evil of the baron; that good man, who can carve a joint like nobody in the world, combines with a genius for anathema treasures of goodness. he can be most amusing as a superior sort of wag, whereas with a certain one of my colleagues, an academician, if you please, i am bored, as xenophon would say, at a hundred drachmae to the hour. but i am afraid that he is expending upon morel rather more than a wholesome morality enjoins, and without knowing to what extent the young penitent shews himself docile or rebellious to the special exercises which his catechist imposes upon him by way of mortification, one need not be a learned clerk to be aware that we should be erring, as the other says, on the side of clemency with regard to this rosicrucian who seems to have come down to us from petronius, by way of saint-simon, if we granted him with our eyes shut, duly signed and sealed, permission to satanise. and yet, in keeping the man occupied while mme. verdurin, for the sinner’s good and indeed rightly tempted by such a cure of souls, proceeds — by speaking to the young fool without any concealment — to remove from him all that he loves, to deal him perhaps a fatal blow, it seems to me that i am leading him into what one might call a man-trap, and i recoil as though from a base action.” this said, he did not hesitate to commit it, but, taking him by the arm, began: “come, baron, let us go and smoke a cigarette, this young man has not yet seen all the marvels of the house.” i made the excuse that i was obliged to go home. “just wait a moment,” said brichot. “you remember, you are giving me a lift, and i have not forgotten your promise.” “wouldn’t you like me, really, to make them bring out their plate, nothing could be simpler,” said m. de charlus. “you promised me, remember, not a word about morel’s decoration. i mean to give him the surprise of announcing it presently when people have begun to leave, although he says that it is of no importance to an artist, but that his uncle would like him to have it” (i blushed, for, i thought to myself, the verdurins would know through my grandfather what morel’s uncle was). “then you wouldn’t like me to make them bring out the best pieces,” said m. de charlus. “of course, you know them already, you have seen them a dozen times at la raspelière.” i dared not tell him that what might have interested me was not the mediocrity of even the most splendid plate in a middle-class household, but some specimen, were it only reproduced in a fine engraving, of mme. du barry’s. i was far too gravely preoccupied — even if i had not been by this revelation as to mlle. vinteuil’s expected presence — always, in society, far too much distracted and agitated to fasten my attention upon objects that were more or less beautiful. it could have been arrested only by the appeal of some reality that addressed itself to my imagination, as might have been, this evening, a picture of that venice of which i had thought so much during the afternoon, or some general element, common to several forms and more genuine than they, which, of its own accord, never failed to arouse in me an inward appreciation, normally lulled in slumber, the rising of which to the surface of my consciousness filled me with great joy. well, as i emerged from the room known as the concert-room, and crossed the other drawing-rooms with brichot and m. de charlus, on discovering, transposed among others, certain pieces of furniture which i had seen at la raspelière and to which i had paid no attention, i perceived, between the arrangement of the town house and that of the country house, a certain common air of family life, a permanent identity, and i understood what brichot meant when he said to me with a smile: “there, look at this room, it may perhaps give you an idea of what things were like in rue montalivet, twenty-five years ago.” from his smile, a tribute to the defunct drawing-room which he saw with his mind’s eye, i understood that what brichot, perhaps without realising it, preferred in the old room, more than the large windows, more than the gay youth of his hosts and their faithful, was that unreal part (which i myself could discern from some similarities between la raspelière and quai conti) of which, in a drawing-room as in everything else, the external, actual part, liable to everyone’s control, is but the prolongation, was that part become purely imaginary, of a colour which no longer existed save for my elderly guide, which he was incapable of making me see, that part which has detached itself from the outer world, to take refuge in our soul, to which it gives a surplus value, in which it is assimilated to its normal substance, transforming itself — houses that have been pulled down, people long dead, bowls of fruit at the suppers which we recall — into that translucent alabaster of our memories, the colour of which we are incapable of displaying, since we alone see it, which enables us to say truthfully to other people, speaking of things past, that they cannot form any idea of them, that they do not resemble anything that they have seen, while we are unable to think of them ourselves without a certain emotion, remembering that it is upon the existence of our thoughts that there depends, for a little time still, their survival, the brilliance of the lamps that have been extinguished and the fragrance of the arbours that will never bloom again. and possibly, for this reason, the drawing-room in rue montalivet disparaged, for brichot, the verdurins’ present home. but on the other hand it added to this home, in the professor’s eyes, a beauty which it could not have in those of a stranger. those pieces of the original furniture that had been transported here, and sometimes arranged in the same groups, and which i myself remembered from la raspelière, introduced into the new drawing-room fragments of the old which, at certain moments, recalled it so vividly as to create a hallucination and then seemed themselves scarcely real from having evoked in the midst of the surrounding reality fragments of a vanished world which seemed to extend round about them. a sofa that had risen up from dreamland between a pair of new and thoroughly substantial armchairs, smaller chairs upholstered in pink silk, the cloth surface of a card-table raised to the dignity of a person since, like a person, it had a past, a memory, retaining in the chill and gloom of quai conti the tan of its roasting by the sun through the windows of rue montalivet (where it could tell the time of day as accurately as mme. verdurin herself) and through the glass doors at la raspelière, where they had taken it and where it used to gaze out all day long over the flower-beds of the garden at the valley far below, until it was time for cottard and the musician to sit down to their game; a posy of violets and pansies in pastel, the gift of a painter friend, now dead, the sole fragment that survived of a life that had vanished without leaving any trace, summarising a great talent and a long friendship, recalling his keen, gentle eyes, his shapely hand, plump and melancholy, while he was at work on it; the incoherent, charming disorder of the offerings of the faithful, which have followed the lady of the house on all her travels and have come in time to assume the fixity of a trait of character, of a line of destiny; a profusion of cut flowers, of chocolate-boxes which here as in the country systematised their growth in an identical mode of blossoming; the curious interpolation of those singular and superfluous objects which still appear to have been just taken from the box in which they were offered and remain for ever what they were at first, new year’s day presents; all those things, in short, which one could not have isolated from the rest, but which for brichot, an old frequenter of the verdurin parties, had that patina, that velvety bloom of things to which, giving them a sort of profundity, an astral body has been added; all these things scattered before him, sounded in his ear like so many resonant keys which awakened cherished likenesses in his heart, confused reminiscences which, here in this drawing-room of the present day that was littered with them, cut out, defined, as on a fine day a shaft of sunlight cuts a section in the atmosphere, the furniture and carpets, and pursuing it from a cushion to a flower-stand, from a footstool to a lingering scent, from the lighting arrangements to the colour scheme, carved, evoked, spiritualised, called to life a form which might be called the ideal aspect, immanent in each of their successive homes, of the verdurin drawing-room. “we must try,” brichot whispered in my ear, “to get the baron upon his favourite topic. he is astounding.” now on the one hand i was glad of an opportunity to try to obtain from m. de charlus information as to the coming of mlle. vinteuil and her friend. on the other hand, i did not wish to leave albertine too long by herself, not that she could (being uncertain of the moment of my return, not to mention that, at so late an hour, she could not have received a visitor or left the house herself without arousing comment) make any evil use of my absence, but simply so that she might not find it too long. and so i told brichot and m. de charlus that i must shortly leave them. “come with us all the same,” said the baron, whose social excitement was beginning to flag, but feeling that need to prolong, to spin out a conversation, which i had already observed in the duchesse de guermantes as well as in himself, and which, while distinctive of their family, extends in a more general fashion to all those people who, offering their minds no other realisation than talk, that is to say an imperfect realisation, remain unassuaged even after hours spent in one’s company, and attach themselves more and more hungrily to their exhausted companion, from whom they mistakenly expect a satiety which social pleasures are incapable of giving. “come, won’t you,” he repeated, “this is the pleasant moment at a party, the moment when all the guests have gone, the hour of dona sol; let us hope that it will end less tragically. unfortunately you are in a hurry, in a hurry probably to go and do things which you would much better leave undone. people are always in a hurry and leave at the time when they ought to be arriving. we are here like couture’s philosophers, this is the moment in which to go over the events of the evening, to make what is called in military language a criticism of the operations. we might ask mme. verdurin to send us in a little supper to which we should take care not to invite her, and we might request charlie — still hernani — to play for ourselves alone the sublime adagio. isn’t it fine, that adagio? but where is the young violinist, i would like to congratulate him, this is the moment for tender words and embraces. admit, brichot, that they played like gods, morel especially. did you notice the moment when that lock of hair came loose? ah, then, my dear fellow, you saw nothing at all. there was an f sharp at which enesco, capet and thibaut might have died of jealousy; i may have appeared calm enough, i can tell you that at such a sound my heart was so wrung that i could barely control my tears. the whole room sat breathless; brichot, my dear fellow,” cried the baron, gripping the other’s arm which he shook violently, “it was sublime. only young charlie preserved a stony immobility, you could not even see him breathe, he looked like one of those objects of the inanimate world of which théodore rousseau speaks, which make us think, but do not think themselves. and then, all of a sudden,” cried m. de charlus with enthusiasm, making a pantomime gesture, “then . . . the lock! and all the time, the charming little country-dance of the allegro vivace. you know, that lock was the symbol of the revelation, even to the most obtuse. the princess of taormina, deaf until then, for there are none so deaf as those that have ears and hear not, the princess of taormina, confronted by the message of the miraculous lock, realised that it was music that they were playing and not poker. oh, that was indeed a solemn moment.” “excuse me, sir, for interrupting you,” i said to m. de charlus, hoping to bring him to the subject in which i was interested, “you told me that the composer’s daughter was to be present. i should have been most interested to meet her. are you certain that she was expected?” “oh, that i can’t say.” m. de charlus thus complied, perhaps unconsciously, with that universal rule by which people withhold information from a jealous lover, whether in order to shew an absurd ‘comradeship,’ as a point of honour, and even if they detest her, with the woman who has excited his jealousy, or out of malice towards her, because they guess that jealousy can only intensify love, or from that need to be disagreeable to other people which consists in revealing the truth to the rest of the world but concealing it from the jealous, ignorance increasing their torment, or so at least the tormentors suppose, who, in their desire to hurt other people are guided by what they themselves believe, wrongly perhaps, to be most painful. “you know,” he went on, “in this house they are a trifle prone to exaggerate, they are charming people, still they do like to catch celebrities of one sort or another. but you are not looking well, and you will catch cold in this damp room,” he said, pushing a chair towards me. “since you have not been well, you must take care of yourself, let me go and find you your coat. no, don’t go for it yourself, you will lose your way and catch cold. how careless people are; you might be an infant in arms, you want an old nurse like me to look after you.” “don’t trouble, baron, let me go,” said brichot, and left us immediately; not being precisely aware perhaps of the very warm affection that m. de charlus felt for me and of the charming lapses into simplicity and devotion that alternated with his delirious crises of grandeur and persecution, he was afraid that m. de charlus, whom mme. verdurin had entrusted like a prisoner to his vigilance, might simply be seeking, under the pretext of asking for my greatcoat, to return to morel and might thus upset the mistress’s plan     meanwhile ski had sat down, uninvited, at the piano, and assuming — with a playful knitting of his brows, a remote gaze and a slight twist of his lips — what he imagined to be an artistic air, was insisting that morel should play something by bizet. “what, you don’t like it, that boyish music of bizet. why, my dear fellow,” he said, with that rolling of the letter r which was one of his peculiarities, “it’s rravishing.” morel, who did not like bizet, said so in exaggerated terms and (as he had the reputation in the little clan of being, though it seems incredible, a wit) ski, pretending to take the violinist’s diatribes as paradoxes, burst out laughing. his laugh was not, like m. verdurin’s, the stifled gasp of a smoker. ski first of all assumed a subtle air, then allowed to escape, as though against his will, a single note of laughter, like the first clang from a belfry, followed by a silence in which the subtle gaze seemed to be making a competent examination of the absurdity of what had been said, then a second peal of laughter shook the air, followed presently by a merry angelus     i expressed to m. de charlus my regret that m. brichot should be taking so much trouble. “not at all, he is delighted, he is very fond of you, everyone is fond of you. somebody was saying only the other day: ‘we never see him now, he is isolating himself!’ besides, he is such a good fellow, is brichot,” m. de charlus went on, never suspecting probably, in view of the affectionate, frank manner in which the professor of moral philosophy conversed with him, that he had no hesitation is slandering him behind his back. “he is a man of great merit, immensely learned, and not a bit spoiled, his learning hasn’t turned him into a bookworm, like so many of them who smell of ink. he has retained a breadth of outlook, a tolerance, rare in his kind. sometimes, when one sees how well he understands life, with what a natural grace he renders everyone his due, one asks oneself where a humble little sorbonne professor, an ex-schoolmaster, can have picked up such breeding. i am astonished at it myself.” i was even more astonished when i saw the conversation of this brichot, which the least refined of mme. de guermantes’s friends would have found so dull, so heavy, please the most critical of them all, m. de charlus. but to achieve this result there had collaborated, among other influences, themselves distinct also, those by virtue of which swann, on the one hand, had so long found favour with the little clan, when he was in love with odette, and on the other hand, after he married, found an attraction in mme. bontemps who, pretending to adore the swann couple, came incessantly to call upon the wife and revelled in all the stories about the husband. just as a writer gives the palm for intelligence, not to the most intelligent man, but to the worldling who utters a bold and tolerant comment upon the passion of a man for a woman, a comment which makes the writer’s bluestocking mistress agree with him in deciding that of all the people who come to her house the least stupid is after all this old beau who shews experience in the things of love, so m. de charlus found more intelligent than the rest of his friends brichot, who was not merely kind to morel, but would cull from the greek philosophers, the latin poets, the authors of oriental tales, appropriate texts which decorated the baron’s propensity with a strange and charming anthology. m. de charlus had reached the age at which a victor hugo chooses to surround himself, above all, with vacqueries and meurices. he preferred to all others those men who tolerated his outlook upon life. “i see a great deal of him,” he went on, in a balanced, sing-song tone, allowing no movement of his lips to stir his grave, powdered mask over which were purposely lowered his prelatical eyelids. “i attend his lectures, that atmosphere of the latin quarter refreshes me, there is a studious, thoughtful adolescence of young bourgeois, more intelligent, better read than were, in a different sphere, my own contemporaries. it is a different world, which you know probably better than i, they are youngbourgeois,” he said, detaching the last word to which he prefixed a string of b_s, and emphasising it from a sort of habit of elocution, corresponding itself to a taste for fine distinctions in past history, which was peculiar to him, but perhaps also from inability to resist the pleasure of giving me a flick of his insolence. this did not in any way diminish the great and affectionate pity that was inspired in me by m. de charlus (after mme. verdurin had revealed her plan in my hearing), it merely amused me, and indeed on any other occasion, when i should not have felt so kindly disposed towards him, would not have offended me. i derived from my grandmother such an absence of any self-importance that i might easily be found wanting in dignity. doubtless, i was scarcely aware of this, and by dint of having seen and heard, from my schooldays onwards, my most esteemed companions take offence if anyone failed to keep an appointment, refuse to overlook any disloyal behaviour, i had come in time to exhibit in my speech and actions a second nature which was stamped with pride. i was indeed considered extremely proud, because, as i had never been timid, i had been easily led into duels, the moral prestige of which, however, i diminished by making little of them, which easily persuaded other people that they were absurd; but the true nature which we trample underfoot continues nevertheless to abide within us. thus it is that at times, if we read the latest masterpiece of a man of genius, we are delighted to find in it all those of our own reflexions which we have always despised, joys and sorrows which we have repressed, a whole world of feelings scorned by us, the value of which the book in which we discover them afresh at once teaches us. i had come in time to learn from my experience of life that it was a mistake to smile a friendly smile when somebody made a fool of me, instead of feeling annoyed. but this want of self-importance and resentment, if i had so far ceased to express it as to have become almost entirely unaware that it existed in me, was nevertheless the primitive, vital element in which i was steeped. anger and spite came to me only in a wholly different manner, in furious crises. what was more, the sense of justice was so far lacking in me as to amount to an entire want of moral sense. i was in my heart of hearts entirely won over to the side of the weaker party, and of anyone who was in trouble. i had no opinion as to the proportion in which good and evil might be blended in the relations between morel and m. de charlus, but the thought of the sufferings that were being prepared for m. de charlus was intolerable to me. i would have liked to warn him, but did not know how to do it. “the spectacle of all that laborious little world is very pleasant to an old stick like myself. i do not know them,” he went on, raising his hand with an air of reserve — so as not to appear to be boasting of his own conquests, to testify to his own purity and not to allow any suspicion to rest upon that of the students —“but they are most civil, they often go so far as to keep a place for me, since i am a very old gentleman. yes indeed, my dear boy, do not protest, i am past forty,” said the baron, who was past sixty. “it is a trifle stuffy in the hall in which brichot lectures, but it is always interesting.” albeit the baron preferred to mingle with the youth of the schools, in other words to be jostled by them, sometimes, to save him a long wait in the lecture-room, brichot took him in by his own door. brichot might well be at home in the sorbonne, at the moment when the janitor, loaded with chains of office, stepped out before him, and the master admired by his young pupils followed, he could not repress a certain timidity, and much as he desired to profit by that moment in which he felt himself so important to shew consideration for charlus, he was nevertheless slightly embarrassed; so that the janitor should allow him to pass, he said to him, in an artificial tone and with a preoccupied air: “follow me, baron, they’ll find a place for you,” then, without paying any more attention to him, to make his own entry, he advanced by himself briskly along the corridor. on either side, a double hedge of young lecturers greeted him; brichot, anxious not to appear to be posing in the eyes of these young men to whom he knew that he was a great pontiff, bestowed on them a thousand glances, a thousand little nods of connivance, to which his desire to remain martial, thoroughly french, gave the effect of a sort of cordial encouragement by an old soldier saying: “damn it all, we can face the foe.” then the applause of his pupils broke out. brichot sometimes extracted from this attendance by m. de charlus at his lectures an opportunity for giving pleasure, almost for returning hospitality. he would say to some parent, or to one of his middle-class friends: “if it would interest your wife or daughter, i may tell you that the baron de charlus, prince de carency, a scion of the house of condé, attends my lectures. it is something to remember, having seen one of the last descendants of our aristocracy who preserves the type. if they care to come, they will know him because he will be sitting next to my chair. besides he will be alone there, a stout man, with white hair and black moustaches, wearing the military medal.” “oh, thank you,” said the father. and, albeit his wife had other engagements, so as not to disoblige brichot, he made her attend the lecture, while the daughter, troubled by the heat and the crowd, nevertheless devoured eagerly with her eyes the descendant of condé, marvelling all the same that he was not crowned with strawberry-leaves and looked just like anybody else of the present day. he meanwhile had no eyes for her, but more than one student, who did not know who he was, was amazed at his friendly glances, became self-conscious and stiff, and the baron left the room full of dreams and melancholy. “forgive me if i return to the subject,” i said quickly to m. de charlus, for i could hear brichot returning, “but could you let me know by wire if you should hear that mlle. vinteuil or her friend is expected in paris, letting me know exactly how long they will be staying and without telling anybody that i asked you.” i had almost ceased to believe that she had been expected, but i wished to guard myself thus for the future. “yes, i will do that for you, first of all because i owe you a great debt of gratitude. by not accepting what, long ago, i had offered you, you rendered me, to your own loss, an immense service, you left me my liberty. it is true that i have abdicated it in another fashion,” he added in a melancholy tone beneath which was visible a desire to take me into his confidence; “that is what i continue to regard as the important fact, a whole combination of circumstances which you failed to turn to your own account, possibly because fate warned you at that precise minute not to cross my path. for always man proposes and god disposes. who knows whether if, on the day when we came away together from mme. de villeparisis’s, you had accepted, perhaps many things that have since happened would never have occurred?” in some embarrassment, i turned the conversation, seizing hold of the name of mme. de villeparisis, and sought to find out from him, so admirably qualified in every respect, for what reasons mme. de villeparisis seemed to be held aloof by the aristocratic world. not only did he not give me the solution of this little social problem, he did not even appear to me to be aware of its existence. i then realised that the position of mme. de villeparisis, if it was in later years to appear great to posterity, and even in the marquise’s lifetime to the ignorant rich, had appeared no less great at the opposite extremity of society, that which touched mme. de villeparisis, that of the guermantes. she was their aunt; they saw first and foremost birth, connexions by marriage, the opportunity of impressing some sister-in-law with the importance of their own family. they regarded this less from the social than from the family point of view. now this was more brilliant in the case of mme. de villeparisis than i had supposed. i had been impressed when i heard that the title villeparisis was falsely assumed. but there are other examples of great ladies who have made degrading marriages and preserved a predominant position. m. de charlus began by informing me that mme. de villeparisis was a niece of the famous duchesse de ——-, the most celebrated member of the great aristocracy during the july monarchy, albeit she had refused to associate with the citizen king and his family. i had so longed to hear stories about this duchess! and mme. de villeparisis, the kind mme. de villeparisis, with those cheeks that to me had been the cheeks of an ordinary woman, mme. de villeparisis who sent me so many presents and whom i could so easily have seen every day, mme. de villeparisis was her niece brought up by her, in her home, at the hôtel de ——-. “she asked the duc de doudeauville,” m. de charlus told me, “speaking of the three sisters, ‘which of the sisters do you prefer?’ and when doudeauville said: ‘madame de villeparisis,’ the duchesse de ——— replied ‘pig!’ for the duchess was extremely witty,” said m. de charlus, giving the word the importance and the special pronunciation in use among the guermantes. that he should have thought the expression so ‘witty’ did not, however, surprise me, for i had on many other occasions remarked the centrifugal, objective tendency which leads men to abdicate, when they are relishing the wit of others, the severity with which they would criticise their own, and to observe, to record faithfully, what they would have scorned to create. “but what on earth is he doing, that is my greatcoat he is bringing,” he said, on seeing that brichot had made so long a search to no better result. “i would have done better to go for it myself. however, you can put it on now. are you aware that it is highly compromising, my dear boy, it is like drinking out of the same glass, i shall be able to read your thoughts. no, not like that, come, let me do it,” and as he put me into his greatcoat, he pressed it down on my shoulders, fastened it round my throat, and brushed my chin with his hand, making the apology: “at his age, he doesn’t know how to put on a coat, one has to titivate him, i have missed my vocation, brichot, i was born to be a nursery-maid.” i wanted to go home, but as m. de charlus had expressed his intention of going in search of morel, brichot detained us both. moreover, the certainty that when i went home i should find albertine there, a certainty as absolute as that which i had felt in the afternoon that albertine would return home from the trocadéro, made me at this moment as little impatient to see her as i had been then when i was sitting at the piano, after françoise had sent me her telephone message. and it was this calm that enabled me, whenever, in the course of this conversation, i attempted to rise, to obey brichot’s injunctions who was afraid that my departure might prevent charlus from remaining with him until the moment when mme. verdurin was to come and fetch us. “come,” he said to the baron, “stay a little here with us, you shall give him the accolade presently,” brichot added, fastening upon myself his almost sightless eyes to which the many operations that he had undergone had restored some degree of life, but which had not all the same the mobility necessary to the sidelong expression of malice. “the accolade, how absurd!” cried the baron, in a shrill and rapturous tone. “my boy, i tell you, he imagines he is at a prize-giving, he is dreaming of his young pupils. i ask myself whether he don’t sleep with them.” “you wish to meet mlle. vinteuil,” said brichot, who had overheard the last words of our conversation. “i promise to let you know if she comes, i shall hear of it from mme. verdurin,” for he doubtless foresaw that the baron was in peril of an immediate exclusion from the little clan. “i see, so you think that i have less claim than yourself upon mme. verdurin,” said m. de charlus, “to be informed of the coming of these terribly disreputable persons. you know that they are quite notorious. mme. verdurin is wrong to allow them to come here, they are all very well for the fast set. they are friends with a terrible band of women. they meet in the most appalling places.” at each of these words, my suffering was increased by the addition of a fresh suffering, changing in form. “certainly not, i don’t suppose that i have any better claim than yourself upon mme. verdurin,” brichot protested, punctuating his words, for he was afraid that he might have aroused the baron’s suspicions. and as he saw that i was determined to go, seeking to detain me with the bait of the promised entertainment: “there is one thing which the baron seems to me not to have taken into account when he speaks of the reputation of these two ladies, namely that a person’s reputation may be at the same time appalling and undeserved. thus for instance, in the more notorious group which i shall call parallel, it is certain that the errors of justice are many and that history has registered convictions for sodomy against illustrious men who were wholly innocent of the charge. the recent discovery of michelangelo’s passionate love for a woman is a fresh fact which should entitle the friend of leo x to the benefit of a posthumous retrial. the michelangelo case seems to me clearly indicated to excite the snobs and mobilise the villette, when another case in which anarchism reared its head and became the fashionable sin of our worthy dilettantes, but which must not even be mentioned now for fear of stirring up quarrels, shall have run its course.” from the moment when brichot began to speak of masculine reputations, m. de charlus betrayed on every one of his features that special sort of impatience which one sees on the face of a medical or military expert when society people who know nothing about the subject begin to talk nonsense about points of therapeutics or strategy. “you know absolutely nothing about the matter,” he said at length to brichot. “quote me a single reputation that is undeserved. mention names. oh yes, i know the whole story,” was his brutal retort to a timid interruption by brichot, “the people who tried it once long ago out of curiosity, or out of affection for a dead friend, and the man who, afraid he has gone too far, if you speak to him of the beauty of a man, replies that that is chinese to him, that he can no more distinguish between a beautiful man and an ugly one than between the engines of two motorcars, mechanics not being in his line. that’s all stuff and nonsense. mind you, i don’t mean to say that a bad (or what is conventionally so called) and yet undeserved reputation is absolutely impossible. it is so exceptional, so rare, that for practical purposes it does not exist. at the same time i, who have a certain curiosity in ferreting things out, have known cases which were not mythical. yes, in the course of my life, i have established (scientifically speaking, of course, you mustn’t take me too literally) two unjustified reputations. they generally arise from a similarity of names, or from certain outward signs, a profusion of rings, for instance, which persons who are not qualified to judge imagine to be characteristic of what you were mentioning, just as they think that a peasant never utters a sentence without adding: ‘jarnignié,’ or an englishman: ‘goddam.’ dialogue for the boulevard theatres. what will surprise you is that the unjustified are those most firmly established in the eyes of the public. you yourself, brichot, who would thrust your hand in the flames to answer for the virtue of some man or other who comes to this house and whom the enlightened know to be a wolf in sheep’s clothing, you feel obliged to believe like every tom, dick and harry in what is said about some man in the public eye who is the incarnation of those propensities to the common herd, when as a matter of fact, he doesn’t care twopence for that sort of thing. i say twopence, because if we were to offer five-and-twenty louis, we should see the number of plaster saints dwindle down to nothing. as things are, the average rate of sanctity, if you see any sanctity in that sort of thing, is somewhere between thirty and forty per cent.” if brichot had transferred to the male sex the question of evil reputations, with me it was, inversely, to the female sex that, thinking of albertine, i applied the baron’s words. i was appalled at his statistics, even when i bore in mind that he was probably enlarging his figures to reach the total that he would like to believe true, and had based them moreover upon the reports of persons who were scandalmongers and possibly liars, and had in any case been led astray by their own desire, which, coming in addition to that of m. de charlus, doubtless falsified the baron’s calculations. “thirty per cent!” exclaimed brichot. “why, even if the proportions were reversed i should still have to multiply the guilty a hundredfold. if it is as you say, baron, and you are not mistaken, then we must confess that you are one of those rare visionaries who discern a truth which nobody round them has ever suspected. just as barrés made discoveries as to parliamentary corruption, the truth of which was afterwards established, like the existence of leverrier’s planet. mme. verdurin would prefer to cite men whom i would rather not name who detected in the intelligence bureau, in the general staff, activities inspired, i am sure, by patriotic zeal, which i had never imagined. upon free-masonry, german espionage, morphinomania, léon daudet builds up, day by day, a fantastic fairy-tale which turns out to be the barest truth. thirty per cent!” brichot repeated in stupefaction. it is only fair to say that m. de charlus taxed the great majority of his contemporaries with inversion, always excepting those men with whom he himself had had relations, their case, provided that they had introduced the least trace of romance into those relations, appearing to him more complex. so it is that we see men of the world, who refuse to believe in women’s honour, allow some remnants of honour only to the woman who has been their mistress, as to whom they protest sincerely and with an air of mystery: “no, you are mistaken, she is not that sort of girl.” this unlooked-for tribute is dictated partly by their own self-respect which is flattered by the supposition that such favours have been reserved for them alone, partly by their simplicity which has easily swallowed everything that their mistress has given them to believe, partly from that sense of the complexity of life which brings it about that, as soon as we approach other people, other lives, ready-made labels and classifications appear unduly crude. “thirty per cent! but have a care; less fortunate than the historians whose conclusions the future will justify, baron, if you were to present to posterity the statistics that you offer us, it might find them erroneous. posterity judges only from documentary evidence, and will insist on being assured of your facts. but as no document would be forthcoming to authenticate this sort of collective phenomena which the few persons who are enlightened are only too ready to leave in obscurity, the best minds would be moved to indignation, and you would be regarded as nothing more than a slanderer or a lunatic. after having, in the social examination, obtained top marks and the primacy upon this earth, you would taste the sorrows of a blackball beyond the grave. that is not worth powder and shot, to quote — may god forgive me — our friend bossuet.” “i am not interested in history,” replied m. de charlus, “this life is sufficient for me, it is quite interesting enough, as poor swann used to say.” “what, you knew swann, baron, i was not aware of that. tell me, was he that way inclined?” brichot inquired with an air of misgiving!“what a mind the man has! so you suppose that i only know men like that. no, i don’t think so,” said charlus, looking to the ground and trying to weigh the pros and cons. and deciding that, since he was dealing with swann whose hostility to that sort of thing had always been notorious, a half-admission could only be harmless to him who was its object and flattering to him who allowed it to escape in an insinuation: “i don’t deny that long ago in our schooldays, once by accident,” said the baron, as though unwillingly and as though he were thinking aloud, then recovering himself: “but that was centuries ago, how do you expect me to remember, you are making a fool of me,” he concluded with a laugh. “in any case, he was never what you’d call a beauty!” said brichot who, himself hideous, thought himself good-looking and was always ready to believe that other men were ugly. “hold your tongue,” said the baron, “you don’t know what you’re talking about, in those days he had a peach-like complexion, and,” he added, finding a fresh note for each syllable, “he was as beautiful as cupid himself. besides he was always charming. the women were madly in love with him.” “but did you ever know his wife?” “why, it was through me that he came to know her. i thought her charming in her disguise one evening when she played miss sacripant; i was with some fellows from the club, each of us took a woman home with him, and, although all that i wanted was to go to sleep, slanderous tongues alleged, for it is terrible how malicious people are, that i went to bed with odette. only she took advantage of the slanders to come and worry me, and i thought i might get rid of her by introducing her to swann. from that moment she never let me go, she couldn’t spell the simplest word, it was i who wrote all her letters for her. and it was i who, afterwards, had to take her out. that, my boy, is what comes of having a good reputation, you see. though i only half deserved it. she forced me to help her to betray him, with five, with six other men.” and the lovers whom odette had had in succession (she had been with this man, then with that, those men not one of whose names had ever been guessed by poor swann, blinded in turn by jealousy and by love, reckoning the chances and believing in oaths more affirmative than a contradiction which escapes from the culprit, a contradiction far more unseizable, and at the same time far more significant, of which the jealous lover might take advantage more logically than of the information which he falsely pretends to have received, in the hope of confusing his mistress), these lovers m. de charlus began to enumerate with as absolute a certainty as if he had been repeating the list of the kings of france. and indeed the jealous lover is, like the contemporaries of an historical event, too close, he knows nothing, and it is in the eyes of strangers that the comic aspect of adultery assumes the precision of history, and prolongs itself in lists of names which are, for that matter, unimportant and become painful only to another jealous lover, such as myself, who cannot help comparing his own case with that which he hears mentioned and asks himself whether the woman of whom he is suspicious cannot boast an equally illustrious list. but he can never know anything more, it is a sort of universal conspiracy, a ‘blindman’s buff’ in which everyone cruelly participates, and which consists, while his mistress flits from one to another, in holding over his eyes a bandage which he is perpetually attempting to tear off without success, for everyone keeps him blindfold, poor wretch, the kind out of kindness, the wicked out of malice, the coarse-minded out of their love of coarse jokes, the well-bred out of politeness and good-breeding, and all alike respecting one of those conventions which are called principles. “but did swann never know that you had enjoyed her favours?” “what an idea! if you had suggested such a thing to charles! it’s enough to make one’s hair stand up on end. why, my dear fellow, he would have killed me on the spot, he was as jealous as a tiger. any more than i ever confessed to odette, not that she would have minded in the least, that . . . but you must not make my tongue run away with me. and the joke of it is that it was she who fired a revolver at him, and nearly hit me. oh! i used to have a fine time with that couple; and naturally it was i who was obliged to act as his second against d’osmond, who never forgave me. d’osmond had carried off odette and swann, to console himself, had taken as his mistress, or make-believe mistress, odette’s sister. but really you must not begin to make me tell you swann’s story, we should be here for ten years, don’t you know, nobody knows more about him than i do. it was i who used to take odette out when she did not wish to see charles. it was all the more awkward for me as i have a quite near relative who bears the name crécy, without of course having any manner of right to it, but still he was none too well pleased. for she went by the name of odette de crécy, as she very well might, being merely separated from a crécy whose wife she still was, and quite an authentic person, a highly respectable gentleman out of whom she had drained his last farthing. but why should i have to tell you about this crécy, i have seen you with him on the crawler, you used to have him to dinner at balbec. he must have needed those dinners, poor fellow, he lived upon a tiny allowance that swann made him; i am greatly afraid that, since my friend’s death, that income must have stopped altogether. what i do not understand,” m. de charlus said to me, “is that, since you used often to go to charles’s, you did not ask me this evening to present you to the queen of naples. in fact i can see that you are less interested in people than in curiosities, and that continues to surprise me in a person who knew swann, in whom that sort of interest was so far developed that it is impossible to say whether it was i who initiated him in these matters or he myself. it surprises me as much as if i met a person who had known whistler and remained ignorant of what is meant by taste. by jove, it is morel that ought really to have been presented to her, he was passionately keen on it too, for he is the most intelligent fellow you could imagine. it is a nuisance that she has left. however, i shall effect the conjunction one of these days. it is indispensable that he should know her. the only possible obstacle would be if she were to die in the night. well, we may hope that it will not happen.” all of a sudden brichot, who was still suffering from the shock of the proportion ‘thirty per cent’ which m. de charlus had revealed to him, brichot who had continued all this time in the pursuit of his idea, with an abruptness which suggested that of an examining magistrate seeking to make a prisoner confess, but which was in reality the result of the professor’s desire to appear perspicacious and of the misgivings that he felt about launching so grave an accusation, spoke. “isn’t ski like that?” he inquired of m. de charlus with a sombre air. to make us admire his alleged power of intuition, he had chosen ski, telling himself that since there were only three innocent men in every ten, he ran little risk of being mistaken if he named ski who seemed to him a trifle odd, suffered from insomnia, scented himself, in short was not entirely normal. “nothing of the sort!” exclaimed the baron with a bitter, dogmatic, exasperated irony. “what you say is utterly false, absurd, fantastic. ski is like that precisely to the people who know nothing about it; if he was, he would not look so like it, be it said without any intention to criticise, for he has a certain charm, indeed i find something very attractive about him.” “but give us a few names, then,” brichot pursued with insistence. m. de charlus drew himself up with a forbidding air. “ah! my dear sir, i, as you know, live in a world of abstraction, all that sort of thing interests me only from a transcendental point of view,” he replied with the touchy susceptibility peculiar to men of his kind, and the affectation of grandiloquence that characterised his conversation. “to me, you understand, it is only general principles that are of any interest, i speak to you of this as i might of the law of gravitation.” but these moments of irritable reaction in which the baron sought to conceal his true life lasted but a short time compared with the hours of continual progression in which he allowed it to be guessed, displayed it with an irritating complacency, the need to confide being stronger in him than the fear of divulging his secret. “what i was trying to say,” he went on, “is that for one evil reputation that is unjustified there are hundreds of good ones which are no less so. obviously, the number of those who do not merit their reputations varies according to whether you rely upon what is said by men of their sort or by the others. and it is true that if the malevolence of the latter is limited by the extreme difficulty which they would find in believing that a vice as horrible to them as robbery or murder is being practised by men whom they know to be sensitive and sincere, the malevolence of the former is stimulated to excess by the desire to regard as — what shall i say? — accessible, men who appeal to them, upon the strength of information given them by people who have been led astray by a similar desire, in fact by the very aloofness with which they are generally regarded. i have heard a man, viewed with considerable disfavour on account of these tastes, say that he supposed that a certain man in society shared them. and his sole reason for believing it was that this other man had been polite to him! so many reasons for optimism,” said the baron artlessly, “in the computation of the number. but the true reason of the enormous difference that exists between the number calculated by the profane, and that calculated by the initiated, arises from the mystery with which the latter surround their actions, in order to conceal them from the rest, who, lacking any source of information, would be literally stupefied if they were to learn merely a quarter of the truth.” “then in our days, things are as they were among the greeks,” said brichot. “what do you mean, among the greeks? do you suppose that it has not been going on ever since? take the reign of louis xiv, you have young vermandois, molière, prince louis of baden, brunswick, charolais, boufflers, the great condé, the duc de brissac.” “stop a moment, i knew about monsieur, i knew about brissac from saint-simon, vendôme of course, and many, others as well. but that old pest saint-simon often refers to the great condé and prince louis of baden and never mentions it.” “it seems a pity, i must say, that it should fall to me to teach a professor of the sorbonne his history. but, my dear master, you are as ignorant as a carp.” “you are harsh, baron, but just. and, wait a moment, now this will please you, i remember now a song of the period composed in macaronic verse about a certain storm which surprised the great condé as he was going down the rhône in the company of his friend, the marquis de la moussaye. condé says:                              carus amicus mussaeus                             ah! quod tempus, bonus deus                             landerirette                             imbre sumus perituri  and la moussaye reassures him with:                              securae sunt nostrae vitae                             sumus enim sodomitae                             igne tantum perituri                             landeriri.”  “i take back what i said,” said charlus in a shrill and mannered tone, “you are a well of learning, you will write it down for me, won’t you, i must preserve it in my family archives, since my great-great-great-grandmother was a sister of m. le prince.” “yes, but, baron, with regard to prince louis of baden i can think of nothing. however, at that period, i suppose that generally speaking the art of war. . . . ” “what nonsense, vendôme, villars, prince eugène, the prince de conti, and if i were to tell you of all the heroes of tonkin, morocco, and i am thinking of men who are truly sublime, and pious, and ‘new generation,’ i should astonish you greatly. ah! i should have something to teach the people who are making inquiries about the new generation which has rejected the futile complications of its elders, m. bourget tells us! i have a young friend out there, who is highly spoken of, who has done great things, however, i am not going to tell tales out of school, let us return to the seventeenth century, you know that saint-simon says of the maréchal d’huxelles — one among many: ‘voluptuous in grecian debaucheries which he made no attempt to conceal, he used to get hold of young officers whom he trained to his purpose, not to mention stalwart young valets, and this openly, in the army and at strasbourg.’ you have probably read madame’s letters, all his men called him ‘putain.’ she is quite outspoken about it.” “and she was in a good position to know, with her husband.” “such an interesting character, madame,” said m. de charlus. “one might base upon her the lyrical synthesis of ‘wives of aunties.’ first of all, the masculine type; generally the wife of an auntie is a man, that is what makes it so easy for her to bear him children. then madame does not mention monsieur’s vices, but she does mention incessantly the same vice in other men, writing as a well-informed woman, from that tendency which makes us enjoy finding in other people’s families the same defects as afflict us in our own, in order to prove to ourselves that there is nothing exceptional or degrading in them. i was saying that things have been much the same in every age. nevertheless, our own is quite remarkable in that respect. and notwithstanding the instances that i have borrowed from the seventeenth century, if my great ancestor françois c. de la rochefoucauld were alive in these days, he might say of them with even more justification than of his own — come, brichot, help me out: ‘vices are common to every age; but if certain persons whom everyone knows had appeared in the first centuries of our era, would anyone speak to-day of the prostitutions of heliogabalus?’ ‘whom everyone knows’ appeals to me immensely. i see that my sagacious kinsman understood the tricks of his most illustrious contemporaries as i understand those of my own. but men of that sort are not only far more frequent to-day. they have also special characteristics.” i could see that m. de charlus was about to tell us in what fashion these habits had evolved. the insistence with which m. de charlus kept on reverting to this topic — into which, moreover, his intellect, constantly trained in the same direction, had acquired a certain penetration — was, in a complicated way, distinctly trying. he was as boring as a specialist who can see nothing outside his own subject, as irritating as a well-informed man whose vanity is flattered by the secrets which he possesses and is burning to divulge, as repellent as those people who, whenever their own defects are mentioned, spread themselves without noticing that they are giving offence, as obsessed as a maniac and as uncontrollably imprudent as a criminal. these characteristics which, at certain moments, became as obvious as those that stamp a madman or a criminal, brought me, as it happened, a certain consolation. for, making them undergo the necessary transposition in order to be able to draw from them deductions with regard to albertine, and remembering her attitude towards saint-loup, and towards myself, i said to myself, painful as one of these memories and melancholy as the other was to me, i said to myself that they seemed to exclude the kind of deformity so plainly denounced, the kind of specialisation inevitably exclusive, it appeared, which was so vehemently apparent in the conversation as in the person of m. de charlus. but he, as ill luck would have it, made haste to destroy these grounds for hope in the same way as he had furnished me with them, that is to say unconsciously. “yes,” he said, “i am no longer in my teens, and i have already seen many things change round about me, i no longer recognise either society, in which the barriers are broken down, in which a mob, devoid of elegance and decency, dance the tango even in my own family, or fashions, or politics, or the arts, or religion, or anything. but i must admit that the thing which has changed most of all is what the germans call homosexuality. good god, in my day, apart from the men who loathed women, and those who, caring only for women, did the other thing merely with an eye to profit, the homosexuals were sound family men and never kept mistresses except to screen themselves. if i had had a daughter to give away, it is among them that i should have looked for my son-in-law if i had wished to be certain that she would not be unhappy. alas! things have changed entirely. nowadays they are recruited also from the men who are the most insatiable with women. i thought i possessed a certain instinct, and that when i said to myself: ‘certainly not,’ i could not have been mistaken. well, i give it up. one of my friends, who is well-known for that sort of thing, bad a coachman whom my sister-in-law oriane found for him, a lad from combray who was something of a jack of all trades, but particularly in trading with women, and who, i would have sworn, was as hostile as possible to anything of that sort. he broke his mistress’s heart by betraying her with two women whom he adored, not to mention the others, an actress and a girl from a bar. my cousin the prince de guermantes, who has that irritating intelligence of people who are too ready to believe anything, said to me one day: ‘but why in the world does not x——-have his coachman? it might be a pleasure to théodore’ (which is the coachman’s name) ‘and he may be annoyed at finding that his master does not make advances to him.’ i could not help telling gilbert to hold his tongue; i was overwrought both by that boasted perspicacity which, when it is exercised indiscriminately, is a want of perspicacity, and also by the sîlver-lined malice of my cousin who would have liked x——-to risk taking the first steps so that, if the going was good, he might follow.” “then the prince de guermantes is like that, too?” asked brichot with a blend of astonishment and dismay. “good god,” replied m. de charlus, highly delighted, “it is so notorious that i don’t think i am guilty of an indiscretion if i tell you that he is. very well, the year after this, i went to balbec, where i heard from a sailor who used to take me out fishing occasionally, that my théodore, whose sister, i may mention, is the maid of a friend of mme. verdurin, baroness putbus, used to come down to the harbour to pick up now one sailor, now another, with the most infernal cheek, to go for a trip on the sea ‘with extras.’” it was now my turn to inquire whether his employer, whom i had identified as the gentleman who at balbec used to play cards all day long with his mistress, and who was the leader of the little group of four boon companions, was like the prince of guermantes. “why, of course, everyone knows about him, he makes no attempt to conceal it.” “but he had his mistress there with him.” “well, and what difference does that make? how innocent these children are,” he said to me in a fatherly tone, little suspecting the grief that i extracted from his words when i thought of albertine. “she is charming, his mistress.” “but then his three friends are like himself.” “not at all,” he cried, stopping his ears as though, in playing some instrument, i had struck a wrong note. “now he has gone to the other extreme. so a man has no longer the right to have friends? ah! youth, youth; it gets everything wrong. we shall have to begin your education over again, my boy. well,” he went on, “i admit that this case, and i know of many others, however open a mind i may try to keep for every form of audacity, does embarrass me. i may be very old-fashioned, but i fail to understand,” he said in the tone of an old gallican speaking of some development of ultramontanism, of a liberal royalist speaking of the action française or of a disciple of claude monet speaking of the cubists. “i do not reproach these innovators, i envy them if anything, i try to understand them, but i do not succeed. if they are so passionately fond of woman, why, and especially in this workaday world where that sort of thing is so frowned upon, where they conceal themselves from a sense of shame, have they any need of what they call ‘a bit of brown’? it is because it represents to them something else. what?” “what else can a woman represent to albertine,” i thought, and there indeed lay the cause of my anguish. “decidedly, baron,” said brichot, “should the board of studies ever think of founding a chair of homosexuality, i shall see that your name is the first to be submitted. or rather, no; an institute of psycho-physiology would suit you better. and i can see you, best of all, provided with a chair in the collège de france, which would enable you to devote yourself to personal researches the results of which you would deliver, like the professor of tamil or sanskrit, to the handful of people who are interested in them. you would have an audience of two, with your assistant, not that i mean to cast the slightest suspicion upon our corps of janitors, whom i believe to be above suspicion.” “you know nothing about them,” the baron retorted in a harsh and cutting tone. “besides you are wrong in thinking that so few people are interested in the subject. it is just the opposite.” and without stopping to consider the incompatibility between the invariable trend of his own conversation and the reproach which he was about to heap upon other people: “it is, on the contrary, most alarming,” said the baron, with a scandalised and contrite air, “people are talking about nothing else. it is a scandal, but i am not exaggerating, my dear fellow! it appears that, the day before yesterday, at the duchesse d’agen’s, they talked about nothing else for two hours on end; you can imagine, if women have taken to discussing that sort of thing, it is a positive scandal! what is vilest of all is that they get their information,” he went on with an extraordinary fire and emphasis, “from pests, regular harlots like young châtellerault, who has the worst reputation in the world, who tell them stories about other men. i have been told that he said more than enough to hang me, but i don’t care, i am convinced that the mud and filth flung by an individual who barely escaped being turned out of the jockey for cheating at cards can only fall back upon himself. i am sure that if i were jane d’agen, i should have sufficient respect for my drawing-room not to allow such subjects to be discussed in it, nor to allow my own flesh and blood to be dragged through the mire in my house. but there is no longer any society, any rules, any conventions, in conversation any more than in dress. ah, my dear fellow, it is the end of the world. everyone has become so malicious. the prize goes to the man who can speak most evil of his fellows. it is appalling.”     as cowardly still as i had been long ago in my boyhood at combray when i used to run away in order not to see my grandfather tempted with brandy and the vain efforts of my grandmother imploring him not to drink it, i had but one thought in my mind, which was to leave the verdurins’ house before the execution of m. de charlus occurred. “i simply must go,” i said to brichot. “i am coming with you,” he replied, “but we cannot slip away, english fashion. come and say good-bye to mme. verdurin,” the professor concluded, as he made his way to the drawing-room with the air of a man who, in a guessing game, goes to find out whether he may ‘come back.’     while we conversed, m. verdurin, at a signal from his wife, had taken morel aside. indeed, had mme. verdurin decided, after considering the matter in all its aspects, that it was wiser to postpone morel’s enlightenment, she was powerless now to prevent it. there are certain desires, some of them confined to the mouth, which, as soon as we have allowed them to grow, insist upon being gratified, whatever the consequences may be; we are unable to resist the temptation to kiss a bare shoulder at which we have been gazing for too long and at which our lips strike like a serpent at a bird, to bury our sweet tooth in a cake that has fascinated and famished it, nor can we forego the delight of the amazement, anxiety, grief or mirth to which we can move another person by some unexpected communication. so, in a frenzy of melodrama, mme. verdurin had ordered her husband to take morel out of the room and, at all costs, to explain matters to him. the violinist had begun by deploring the departure of the queen of naples before he had had a chance of being presented to her. m. de charlus had told him so often that she was the sister of the empress elisabeth and of the duchesse d’alençon that her majesty had assumed an extraordinary importance in his eyes. but the master explained to him that it was not to talk about the queen of naples that they had withdrawn from the rest, and then went straight to the root of the matter. “listen,” he had concluded after a long explanation; “listen; if you like, we can go and ask my wife what she thinks. i give you my word of honour, i’ve said nothing to her about it. we shall see how she looks at it. my advice is perhaps not the best, but you know how sound her judgment is; besides, she is extremely attached to yourself, let us go and submit the case to her.” and while mme. verdurin, awaiting with impatience the emotions that she would presently be relishing as she talked to the musician, and again, after he had gone, when she made her husband give her a full report of their conversation, continued to repeat: “but what in the world can they be doing? i do hope that my husband, in keeping him all this time, has managed to give him his cue,” m. verdurin reappeared with morel who seemed greatly moved. “he would like to ask your advice,” m. verdurin said to his wife, in the tone of a man who does not know whether his prayer will be heard. instead of replying to m. verdurin, it was to morel that, in the heat of her passion, mme. verdurin addressed herself. “i agree entirely with my husband, i consider that you cannot tolerate this sort of thing for another instant,” she exclaimed with violence, discarding as a useless fiction her agreement with her husband that she was supposed to know nothing of what he had been saying to the violinist. “how do you mean? tolerate what?” stammered m. verdurin, endeavouring to feign astonishment and seeking, with an awkwardness that was explained by his dismay, to defend his falsehood. “i guessed what you were saying to him,” replied mme. verdurin, undisturbed by the improbability of this explanation, and caring little what, when he recalled this scene, the violinist might think of the mistress’s veracity. “no,” mme. verdurin continued, “i feel that you ought not to endure any longer this degrading promiscuity with a tainted person whom nobody will have in her house,” she went on, regardless of the fact that this was untrue and forgetting that she herself entertained him almost daily. “you are the talk of the conservatoire,” she added, feeling that this was the argument that carried most weight; “another month of this life and your artistic future is shattered, whereas, without charlus, you ought to be making at least a hundred thousand francs a year.” “but i have never heard anyone utter a word, i am astounded, i am very grateful to you,” morel murmured, the tears starting to his eyes. but, being obliged at once to feign astonishment and to conceal his shame, he had turned redder and was perspiring more abundantly than if he had played all beethoven’s sonatas in succession, and tears welled from his eyes which the bonn master would certainly not have drawn from him. “if you have never heard anything, you are unique in that respect. he is a gentleman with a vile reputation and the most shocking stories are told about him. i know that the police are watching him and that is perhaps the best thing for him if he is not to end like all those men, murdered by hooligans,” she went on, for as she thought of charlus the memory of mme. de duras recurred to her, and in her frenzy of rage she sought to aggravate still further the wounds that she was inflicting on the unfortunate charlie, and to avenge herself for those that she had received in the course of the evening. “anyhow, even financially, he can be of no use to you, he is completely ruined since he has become the prey of people who are blackmailing him, and who can’t even make him fork out the price of the tune they call, still less can he pay you for your playing, for it is all heavily mortgaged, town house, country house, everything.” morel was all the more ready to believe this lie since m. de charlus liked to confide in him his relations with hooligans, a race for which the son of a valet, however debauched he may be, professes a feeling of horror as strong as his attachment to bonapartist principles     already, in the cunning mind of morel, a plan was beginning to take shape similar to what was called in the eighteenth century the reversal of alliances. determined never to speak to m. de charlus again, he would return on the following evening to jupien’s niece, and see that everything was made straight with her. unfortunately for him this plan was doomed to failure, m. de charlus having made an appointment for that very evening with jupien, which the ex-tailor dared not fail to keep, in spite of recent events. other events, as we shall see, having followed upon morel’s action, when jupien in tears told his tale of woe to the baron, the latter, no less wretched, assured him that he would adopt the forsaken girl, that she should assume one of the titles that were at his disposal, probably that of mlle. d’oloron, that he would see that she received a thorough education, and furnish her with a rich husband. promises which filled jupien with joy and left his niece unmoved, for she was still in love with morel, who, from stupidity or cynicism, used to come into the shop and tease her in jupien’s absence. “what is the matter with you,” he would say with a laugh, “with those black marks under your eyes? a broken heart? gad, the years pass and people change. after all, a man is free to try on a shoe, all the more a woman, and if she doesn’t fit him. . . . ” he lost his temper once only, because she cried, which he considered cowardly, unworthy of her. people are not always very tolerant of the tears which they themselves have provoked     but we have looked too far ahead, for all this did not happen until after the verdurins’ party which we have interrupted, and we must go back to the point at which we left off. “i should never have suspected it,” morel groaned, in answer to mme. verdurin. “naturally people do not say it to your face, that does not prevent your being the talk of the conservatoire,” mme. verdurin went on wickedly, seeking to make it plain to morel that it was not only m. de charlus that was being criticised, but himself also. “i can well believe that you know nothing about it; all the same, people are quite outspoken. ask ski what they were saying the other day at chevillard’s within a foot of us when you came into my box. i mean to say, people point you out. as far as i’m concerned, i don’t pay the slightest attention, but what i do feel is that it makes a man supremely ridiculous and that he becomes a public laughing-stock for the rest of his life.” “i don’t know how to thank you,” said charlie in the tone we use to a dentist who has just caused us terrible pain while we tried not to let him see it, or to a too bloodthirsty second who has forced us into a duel on account of some casual remark of which he has said: “you can’t swallow that.” “i believe that you have plenty of character, that you are a man,” replied mme. verdurin, “and that you will be capable of speaking out boldly, although he tells everybody that you would never dare, that he holds you fast.” charlie, seeking a borrowed dignity in which to cloak the tatters of his own, found in his memory something that he had read or, more probably, heard quoted, and at once proclaimed: “i was not brought up to eat that sort of bread. this very evening i will break with m. de charlus. the queen of naples has gone, hasn’t she? otherwise, before breaking with him, i should like to ask him. . . . ” “it is not necessary to break with him altogether,” said mme. verdurin, anxious to avoid a disruption of the little nucleus. “there is no harm in your seeing him here, among our little group, where you are appreciated, where no one speaks any evil of you. but insist upon your freedom, and do not let him drag you about among all those sheep who are friendly to your face; i wish you could have heard what they were saying behind your back. anyhow, you need feel no regret, not only are you wiping off a stain which would have marked you for the rest of your life, from the artistic point of view, even if there had not been this scandalous presentation by charlus, i don’t mind telling you that wasting yourself like this in this sham society will make people suppose that you aren’t serious, give you an amateur reputation, as a little drawing-room performer, which is a terrible thing at your age. i can understand that to all those fine ladies it is highly convenient to be able to return their friends’ hospitality by making you come and play for nothing, but it is your future as an artist that would foot the bill. i don’t say that you shouldn’t go to one or two of them. you were speaking of the queen of naples — who has left, for she had to go on to another party — now she is a splendid woman, and i don’t mind saying that i think she has a poor opinion of charlus and came here chiefly to please me. yes, yes, i know she was longing to meet us, m. verdurin and myself. that is a house in which you might play. and then i may tell you that if i take you — because the artists all know me, you understand, they have always been most obliging to me, and regard me almost as one of themselves, as their mistress — that is a very different matter. but whatever you do, you must never go near mme. de duras! don’t go and make a stupid blunder like that! i know several artists who have come here and told me all about her. they know they can trust me,” she said, in the sweet and simple tone which she knew how to adopt in an instant, imparting an appropriate air of modesty to her features, an appropriate charm to her eyes, “they come here, just like that, to tell me all their little troubles; the ones who are said to be most silent, go on chatting to me sometimes for hours on end and i can’t tell you how interesting they are. poor chabrier used always to say: ‘there’s nobody like mme. verdurin for getting them to talk.’ very well, don’t you know, all of them, without one exception, i have seen them in tears because they had gone to play for mme. de duras. it is not only the way she enjoys making her servants humiliate them, they could never get an engagement anywhere else again. the agents would say: ‘oh yes, the fellow who plays at mme. de duras’s.’ that settled it. there is nothing like that for ruining a man’s future. you know what society people are like, it’s not taken seriously, you may have all the talent in the world, it’s a dreadful thing to have to say, but one mme. de duras is enough to give you the reputation of an amateur. and among artists, don’t you know, well i, you can ask yourself whether i know them, when i have been moving among them for forty years, launching them, taking an interest in them; very well, when they say that somebody is an amateur, that finishes it. and people were beginning to say it of you. indeed, at times i have been obliged to take up the cudgels, to assure them that you would not play in some absurd drawing-room! do you know what the answer was: ‘but he will be forced to go, charlus won’t even consult him, he never asks him for his opinion.’ somebody thought he would pay him a compliment and said: ‘we greatly admire your friend morel.’ can you guess what answer he made, with that insolent air which you know? ‘but what do you mean by calling him my friend, we are not of the same class, say rather that he is my creature, my protégé.’” at this moment there stirred beneath the convex brows of the musical deity the one thing that certain people cannot keep to themselves, a saying which it is not merely abject but imprudent to repeat. but the need to repeat it is stronger than honour, than prudence. it was to this need that, after a few convulsive movements of her spherical and sorrowful brows, the mistress succumbed: “some one actually told my husband that he had said ‘my servant,’ but for that i cannot vouch,” she added. it was a similar need that had compelled m. de charlus, shortly after he had sworn to morel that nobody should ever know the story of his birth, to say to mme. verdurin: “his father was a flunkey.” a similar need again, now that the story had been started, would make it circulate from one person to another, each of whom would confide it under the seal of a secrecy which would be promised and not kept by the hearer, as by the informant himself. these stories would end, as in the game called hunt-the-thimble, by being traced back to mme. verdurin, bringing down upon her the wrath of the person concerned, who would at last have learned the truth. she knew this, but could not repress the words that were burning her tongue. anyhow, the word ‘servant’ was bound to annoy morel. she said ‘servant’ nevertheless, and if she added that she could not vouch for the word, this was so as at once to appear certain of the rest, thanks to this hint of uncertainty, and to shew her impartiality. this impartiality that she shewed, she herself found so touching that she began to speak affectionately to charlie: “for, don’t you see,” she went on, “i am not blaming him, he is dragging you down into his abyss, it is true, but it is not his fault, since he wallows in it himself, since he wallows in it,” she repeated in a louder tone, having been struck by the aptness of the image which had taken shape so quickly that her attention only now overtook it and was trying to give it prominence. “no, the fault that i do find with him,” she said in a melting tone — like a woman drunken with her own success —“is a want of delicacy towards yourself. there are certain things which one does not say in public. well, this evening, he was betting that he would make you blush with joy, by telling you (stuff and nonsense, of course, for his recommendation would be enough to prevent your getting it) that you were to have the cross of the legion of honour. even that i could overlook, although i have never quite liked,” she went on with a delicate, dignified air, “hearing a person make a fool of his friends, but, don’t you know, there are certain little things that one does resent. such as when he told us, with screams of laughter, that if you want the cross it’s to please your uncle and that your uncle was a footman.” “he told you that!” cried charlie, believing, on the strength of this adroitly interpolated quotation, in the truth of everything that mme. verdurin had said! mme. verdurin was overwhelmed with the joy of an old mistress who, just as her young lover was on the point of deserting her, has succeeded in breaking off his marriage, and it is possible that she had not calculated her lie, that she was not even consciously lying. a sort of sentimental logic, something perhaps more elementary still, a sort of nervous reflex urging her, in order to brighten her life and preserve her happiness, to stir up trouble in the little clan, may have brought impulsively to her lips, without giving her time to check their veracity, these assertions diabolically effective if not rigorously exact. “if he had only repeated it to us, it wouldn’t matter,” the mistress went on, “we know better than to listen to what he says, besides, what does a man’s origin matter, you have your own value, you are what you make yourself, but that he should use it to make mme. de portefin laugh” (mme. verdurin named this lady on purpose because she knew that charlie admired her) “that is what vexes us: my husband said to me when he heard him: ‘i would sooner he had struck me in the face.’ for he is as fond of you as i am, don’t you know, is gustave” (from this we learn that m. verdurin’s name was gustave). “he is really very sensitive.” “but i never told you i was fond of him,” muttered m. verdurin, acting the kind-hearted curmudgeon. “it is charlus that is fond of him.” “oh, no! now i realise the difference, i was betrayed by a scoundrel and you, you are good,” charlie exclaimed in all sincerity. “no, no,” murmured mme. verdurin, seeking to retain her victory, for she felt that her wednesdays were safe, but not to abuse it: “scoundrel is too strong; he does harm, a great deal of harm, unconsciously; you know that tale about the legion of honour was the affair of a moment. and it would be painful to me to repeat all that he said about your family,” said mme. verdurin, who would have been greatly embarrassed had she been asked to do so. “oh, even if it only took a moment, it proves that he is a traitor,” cried morel. it was at this moment that we returned to the drawing-room. “ah!” exclaimed m. de charlus when he saw that morel was in the room, advancing upon him with the alacrity of the man who has skillfully organised a whole evening’s entertainment with a view to an assignation with a woman, and in his excitement never imagines that he has with his own hands set the snare in which he will presently be caught and publicly thrashed by bravoes stationed in readiness by her husband. “well, after all it is none too soon; are you satisfied, young glory, and presently young knight of the legion of honour? for very soon you will be able to sport your cross,” m. de charlus said to morel with a tender and triumphant air, but by the very mention of the decoration endorsed mme. verdurin’s lies, which appeared to morel to be indisputable truth. “leave me alone, i forbid you to come near me,” morel shouted at the baron. “you know what i mean, all right, i’m not the first young man you’ve tried to corrupt!” my sole consolation lay in the thought that i was about to see morel and the verdurins pulverised by m. de charlus. for a thousand times less an offence i had been visited with his furious rage, no one was safe from it, a king would not have intimidated him. instead of which, an extraordinary thing happened. one saw m. de charlus dumb, stupefied, measuring the depths of his misery without understanding its cause, finding not a word to utter, raising his eyes to stare at each of the company in turn, with a questioning, outraged, suppliant air, which seemed to be asking them not so much what had happened as what answer he ought to make. and yet m. de charlus possessed all the resources, not merely of eloquence but of audacity, when, seized by a rage which had long been simmering against some one, he reduced him to desperation, with the most outrageous speeches, in front of a scandalised society which had never imagined that anyone could go so far. m. de charlus, on these occasions, burned, convulsed with a sort of epilepsy, which left everyone trembling. but in these instances he had the initiative, he launched the attack, he said whatever came into his mind (just as bloch was able to make fun of jews and blushed if the word jew was uttered in his hearing). perhaps what struck him speechless was — when he saw that m. and mme. verdurin turned their eyes from him and that no one was coming to his rescue — his anguish at the moment and, still more, his dread of greater anguish to come; or else that, not having lost his temper in advance, in imagination, and forged his thunderbolt, not having his rage ready as a weapon in his hand, he had been seized and dealt a mortal blow at the moment when he was unarmed (for, sensitive, neurotic, hysterical, his impulses were genuine, but his courage was a sham; indeed, as i had always thought, and this was what made me like him, his malice was a sham also: the people whom he hated, he hated because he thought that they looked down upon him; had they been civil to him, instead of flying into a furious rage with them, he would have taken them to his bosom, and he did not shew the normal reactions of a man of honour who has been insulted); or else that, in a sphere which was not his own, he felt himself less at his ease and less courageous than he would have been in the faubourg. the fact remains that, in this drawing-room which he despised, this great nobleman (in whom his sense of superiority to the middle classes was no less essentially inherent than it had been in any of his ancestors who had stood in the dock before the revolutionary tribunal) could do nothing, in a paralysis of all his members, including his tongue, but cast in every direction glances of terror, outraged by the violence that had been done to him, no less suppliant than questioning. in a situation so cruelly unforeseen, this great talker could do no more than stammer: “what does it all mean, what has happened?” his question was not even heard. and the eternal pantomime of panic terror has so little altered, that this elderly gentleman, to whom a disagreeable incident had just occurred in a parisian drawing-room, unconsciously repeated the various formal attitudes in which the greek sculptors of the earliest times symbolised the terror of nymphs pursued by the great pan     the ambassador who has been recalled, the undersecretary placed suddenly on the retired list, the man about town whom people began to cut, the lover who has been shewn the door examine sometimes for months on end the event that has shattered their hopes; they turn it over and over like a projectile fired at them they know not whence or by whom, almost as though it were a meteorite. they would fain know the elements that compose this strange engine which has burst upon them, learn what hostilities may be detected in them. chemists have at least the power of analysis; sick men suffering from a malady the origin of which they do not know can send for the doctor; criminal mysteries are more or less solved by the examining magistrate. but when it comes to the disconcerting actions of our fellow-men, we rarely discover their motives. thus m. de charlus, to anticipate the days that followed this party to which we shall presently return, could see in charlie’s attitude one thing alone that was self-evident. charlie, who had often threatened the baron that he would tell people of the passion that he inspired in him, must have seized the opportunity to do so when he considered that he had now sufficiently ‘arrived’ to be able to fly unaided. and he must, out of sheer ingratitude, have told mme. verdurin everything. but how had she allowed herself to be taken in (for the baron, having made up his mind to deny the story, had already persuaded himself that the sentiments for which he was blamed were imaginary)? some friends of mme. verdurin, who themselves perhaps felt a passion for charlie, must have prepared the ground. accordingly, m. de charlus during the next few days wrote terrible letters to a number of the faithful, who were entirely innocent and concluded that he must be mad; then he went to mme. verdurin with a long and moving tale, which had not at all the effect that he desired. for in the first place mme. verdurin repeated to the baron: “all you need do is not to bother about him, treat him with scorn, he is a mere boy.” now the baron longed only for a reconciliation. in the second place, to bring this about, by depriving charlie of everything of which he had felt himself assured, he asked mme. verdurin not to invite him again; a request which she met with a refusal that brought upon her angry and sarcastic letters from m. de charlus. flitting from one supposition to another, the baron never arrived at the truth, which was that the blow had not come from morel. it is true that he might have learned this by asking him for a few minutes’ conversation. but he felt that this would injure his dignity and would be against the interests of his love. he had been insulted, he awaited an explanation. there is, for that matter, almost invariably, attached to the idea of a conversation which might clear up a misunderstanding, another idea which, whatever the reason, prevents us from agreeing to that conversation. the man who is abased and has shewn his weakness on a score of occasions, will furnish proofs of pride on the twenty-first, the only occasion on which it would serve him not to adopt a headstrong and arrogant attitude but to dispel an error which will take root in his adversary failing a contradiction. as for the social side of the incident, the rumour spread abroad that m. de charlus had been turned out of the verdurins’ house at the moment when he was attempting to rape a young musician. the effect of this rumour was that nobody was surprised when m. de charlus did not appear again at the verdurins’, and whenever he happened by chance to meet, anywhere else, one of the faithful whom he had suspected and insulted, as this person had a grudge against the baron who himself abstained from greeting him, people were not surprised, realising that no member of the little clan would ever wish to speak to the baron again     while m. de charlus, rendered speechless by morel’s words and by the attitude of the mistress, stood there in the pose of the nymph a prey to panic terror, m. and mme. verdurin had retired to the outer drawing-room, as a sign of diplomatic rupture, leaving m. de charlus by himself, while on the platform morel was putting his violin in its case. “now you must tell us exactly what happened,” mme. verdurin appealed avidly to her husband. “i don’t know what you can have said to him, he looked quite upset,” said ski, “there are tears in his eyes.” pretending not to have understood: “i’m sure, nothing that i said could make any difference to him,” said mme. verdurin, employing one of those stratagems which do not deceive everybody, so as to force the sculptor to repeat that charlie was in tears, tears which filled the mistress with too much pride for her to be willing to run the risk that one or other of the faithful, who might not have heard what was said, remained in ignorance of them. “no, it has made a difference, for i saw big tears glistening in his eyes,” said the sculptor in a low tone with a smile of malicious connivance, and a sidelong glance to make sure that morel was still on the platform and could not overhear the conversation. but there was somebody who did overhear, and whose presence, as soon as it was observed, was to restore to morel one of the hopes that he had forfeited. this was the queen of naples, who, having left her fan behind, had thought it more polite, on coming away from another party to which she had gone on, to call for it in person. she had entered the room quite quietly, as though she were ashamed of herself, prepared to make apologies for her presence, and to pay a little call upon her hostess now that all the other guests had gone. but no one had heard her come in, in the heat of the incident the meaning of which she had at once gathered, and which set her ablaze with indignation. “ski says that he had tears in his eyes, did you notice that? i did not see any tears. ah, yes, i remember now,” she corrected herself, in the fear that her denial might not be believed. “as for charlus, he’s not far off them, he ought to take a chair, he’s tottering on his feet, he’ll be on the floor in another minute,” she said with a pitiless laugh. at that moment morel hastened towards her: “isn’t that lady the queen of naples?” he asked (albeit he knew quite well that she was), pointing to her majesty who was making her way towards charlus. “after what has just happened, i can no longer, i’m afraid, ask the baron to present me.” “wait, i shall take you to her myself,” said mme. verdurin, and, followed by a few of the faithful, but not by myself and brichot who made haste to go and call for our hats and coats, she advanced upon the queen who was talking to m. de charlus. he had imagined that the realisation of his great desire that morel should be presented to the queen of naples could be prevented only by the improbable demise of that lady. but we picture the future as a reflexion of the present projected into empty space, whereas it is the result, often almost immediate, of causes which for the most part escape our notice. not an hour had passed, and now m. de charlus would have given everything he possessed in order that morel should not be presented to the queen. mme. verdurin made the queen a curtsey. seeing that the other appeared not to recognise her: “i am mme. verdurin. your majesty does not remember me.” “quite well,” said the queen as she continued so naturally to converse with m. de charlus and with an air of such complete indifference that mme. verdurin doubted whether it was to herself that this ‘quite well’ had been addressed, uttered with a marvellously detached intonation, which wrung from m. de charlus, despite his broken heart, a smile of expert and delighted appreciation of the art of impertinence. morel, who had watched from the distance the preparations for his presentation, now approached. the queen offered her arm to m. de charlus. with him, too, she was vexed, but only because he did not make a more energetic stand against vile detractors. she was crimson with shame for him whom the verdurins dared to treat in this fashion. the entirely simple civility which she had shewn them a few hours earlier, and the arrogant pride with which she now stood up to face them, had their source in the same region of her heart. the queen, as a woman full of good nature, regarded good nature first and foremost in the form of an unshakable attachment to the people whom she liked, to her own family, to all the princes of her race, among whom was m. de charlus, and, after them, to all the people of the middle classes or of the humblest populace who knew how to respect those whom she liked and felt well-disposed towards them. it was as to a woman endowed with these sound instincts that she had shewn kindness to mme. verdurin. and, no doubt, this is a narrow conception, somewhat tory, and increasingly obsolete, of good nature. but this does not mean that her good nature was any less genuine or ardent. the ancients were no less strongly attached to the group of humanity to which they devoted themselves because it did not exceed the limits of their city, nor are the men of to-day to their country than will be those who in the future love the united states of the world. in my own immediate surroundings, i have had an example of this in my mother whom mme. de cambremer and mme. de guermantes could never persuade to take part in any philanthropic undertaking, to join any patriotic workroom, to sell or to be a patroness at any bazaar. i do not go so far as to say that she was right in doing good only when her heart had first spoken, and in reserving for her own family, for her servants, for the unfortunate whom chance brought in her way, her treasures of love and generosity, but i do know that these, like those of my grandmother, were unbounded and exceeded by far anything that mme. de guermantes or mme. de cambremer ever could have done or did. the case of the queen of naples was altogether different, but even here it must be admitted that her conception of deserving people was not at all that set forth in those novels of dostoievski which albertine had taken from my shelves and devoured, that is to say in the guise of wheedling parasites, thieves, drunkards, at one moment stupid, at another insolent, debauchees, at a pinch murderers. extremes, however, meet, since the noble man, the brother, the outraged kinsman whom the queen sought to defend, was m. de charlus, that is to say, notwithstanding his birth and all the family ties that bound him to the queen, a man whose virtue was hedged round by many vices. “you do not look at all well, my dear cousin,” she said to m. de charlus. “léan upon my arm. be sure that it will still support you. it is firm enough for that.” then, raising her eyes proudly to face her adversaries (at that moment, ski told me, there were in front of her mme. verdurin and morel), “you know that, in the past, at gaeta, it held the mob in defiance. it will be able to serve you as a rampart.” and it was thus, taking the baron on her arm and without having allowed morel to be presented to her, that the splendid sister of the empress elisabeth left the house. it might be supposed, in view of m. de charlus’s terrible nature, the persecutions with which he terrorised even his own family, that he would, after the events of this evening, let loose his fury and practise reprisals upon the verdurins. we have seen why nothing of this sort occurred at first. then the baron, having caught cold shortly afterwards, and contracted the septic pneumonia which was very rife that winter, was for long regarded by his doctors, and regarded himself, as being at the point of death, and lay for many months suspended between it and life. was there simply a physical change, and the substitution of a different malady for the neurosis that had previously made him lose all control of himself in his outbursts of rage? for it is too obvious to suppose that, having never taken the verdurins seriously, from the social point of view, but having come at last to understand the part that they had played, he was unable to feel the resentment that he would have felt for any of his equals; too obvious also to remember that neurotics, irritated on the slightest provocation by imaginary and inoffensive enemies, become on the contrary inoffensive as soon as anyone takes the offensive against them, and that we can calm them more easily by flinging cold water in their faces than by attempting to prove to them the inanity of their grievances. it is probably not in a physical change that we ought to seek the explanation of this absence of rancour, but far more in the malady itself. it exhausted the baron so completely that he had little leisure left in which to think about the verdurins. he was almost dead. we mentioned offensives; even those which have only a posthumous effect require, if we are to ‘stage’ them properly, the sacrifice of a part of our strength. m. de charlus had too little strength left for the activity of a preparation. we hear often of mortal enemies who open their eyes to gaze upon one another in the hour of death and close them again, made happy. this must be a rare occurrence, except when death surprises us in the midst of life. it is, on the contrary, at the moment when we have nothing left to lose, that we are not bothered by the risks which, when full of life, we would lightly have undertaken. the spirit of vengeance forms part of life, it abandons us as a rule — notwithstanding certain exceptions which, occurring in the heart of the same person, are, as we shall see, human contradictions — on the threshold of death. after having thought for a moment about the verdurins, m. de charlus felt that he was too weak, turned his face to the wall, and ceased to think about anything. if he often lay silent like this, it was not that he had lost his eloquence. it still flowed from its source, but it had changed. detached from the violence which it had so often adorned, it was no more now than an almost mystic eloquence decorated with words of meekness, words from the gospel, an apparent resignation to death. he talked especially on the days when he thought that he would live. a relapse made him silent. this christian meekness into which his splendid violence was transposed (as is in esther the so different genius of andromaque) provoked the admiration of those who came to his bedside. it would have provoked that of the verdurins themselves, who could not have helped adoring a man whom his weakness had made them hate. it is true that thoughts which were christian only in appearance rose to the surface. he implored the archangel gabriel to appear and announce to him, as to the prophet, at what time the messiah would come to him. and, breaking off with a sweet and sorrowful smile, he would add: “but the archangel must not ask me, as he asked daniel, to have patience for ‘seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks,’ for i should be dead before then.” the person whom he awaited thus was morel. and so he asked the archangel raphael to bring him to him, as he had brought the young tobias. and, introducing more human methods (like sick popes who, while ordering masses to be said, do not neglect to send for their doctors), he insinuated to his visitors that if brichot were to bring him without delay his young tobias, perhaps the archangel raphael would consent to restore brichot’s sight, as he had done to the father of tobias, or as had happened in the sheep-pool of bethesda. but, notwithstanding these human lapses, the moral purity of m. de charlus’s conversation had none the less become alarming. vanity, slander, the insanity of malice and pride, had alike disappeared. morally m. de charlus had been raised far above the level at which he had lived in the past. but this moral perfection, as to the reality of which his oratorical art was for that matter capable of deceiving more than one of his compassionate audience, this perfection vanished with the malady which had laboured on its behalf. m. de charlus returned along the downward slope with a rapidity which, as we shall see, continued steadily to increase. but the verdurins’ attitude towards him was by that time no more than a somewhat distant memory which more immediate outbursts prevented from reviving     to turn back to the verdurins’ party, when the host and hostess were by themselves, m. verdurin said to his wife: “you know where cottard has gone? he is with saniette: he has been speculating to put himself straight and has gone smash. when he got home just now after leaving us, and learned that he hadn’t a penny in the world and nearly a million francs of debts, saniette had a stroke.” “but then, why did he gamble, it’s idiotic, he was the last person in the world to succeed at that game. cleverer men than he get plucked at it, and he was born to let himself be swindled by every tom, dick and harry.” “why, of course, we have always known that he was an idiot,” said m. verdurin. “anyhow, this is the result. here you have a man who will be turned out of house and home to-morrow by his landlord, who is going to find himself utterly penniless; his family don’t like him, forcheville is the last man in the world to do anything for him. and so it occurred to me, i don’t wish to do anything that doesn’t meet with your approval, but we might perhaps be able to scrape up a small income for him so that he shan’t be too conscious of his ruin, so that he can keep a roof over his head.” “i entirely agree with you, it is very good of you to have thought of it. but you say ‘a roof; the imbecile has kept on an apartment beyond his means, he can’t remain in it, we shall have to find him a couple of rooms somewhere. i understand that at the present moment he is still paying six or seven thousand francs for his apartment.” “six thousand, five hundred. but he is greatly attached to his home. in short, he has had his first stroke, he can scarcely live more than two or three years. suppose we were to allow him ten thousand francs for three years. it seems to me that we should be able to afford that. we might for instance this year, instead of taking la raspelière again, get hold of something on a simpler scale. with our income, it seems to me that to sacrifice ten thousand francs a year for three years is not out of the question.” “very well, there’s only the nuisance that people will get to know about it, we shall be expected to do it again for others.” “believe me, i have thought about that. i shall do it only upon the express condition that nobody knows anything about it. thank you, i have no desire that we should become the benefactors of the human race. no philanthropy! what we might do is to tell him that the money has been left to him by princess sherbatoff.” “but will he believe it? she consulted cottard about her will.” “if the worse comes to the worst, we might take cottard into our confidence, he is used to professional secrecy, he makes an enormous amount of money, he won’t be like one of those busybodies one is obliged to hush up. he may even be willing to say, perhaps, that it was himself that the princess appointed as her agent. in that way we shouldn’t even appear. that would avoid all the nuisance of scenes, and gratitude, and speeches.” m. verdurin added an expression which made quite plain the kind of touching scenes and speeches which they were anxious to avoid. but it cannot have been reported to me correctly, for it was not a french expression, but one of those terms that are to be found in certain families to denote certain things, annoying things especially, probably because people wish to indicate them in the hearing of the persons concerned without being understood! an expression of this sort is generally a survival from an earlier condition of the family. in a jewish family, for instance, it will be a ritual term diverted from its true meaning, and perhaps the only hebrew word with which the family, now thoroughly french, is still acquainted. in a family that is strongly provincial, it will be a term in the local dialect, albeit the family no longer speaks or even understands that dialect. in a family that has come from south america and no longer speaks anything but french, it will be a spanish word. and, in the next generation, the word will no longer exist save as a childish memory. they may remember quite well that their parents at table used to allude to the servants who were waiting, without being understood by them, by employing some such word, but the children cannot tell exactly what the word meant, whether it was spanish, hebrew, german, dialect, if indeed it ever belonged to any language and was not a proper name or a word entirely forged. the uncertainty can be cleared up only if they have a great-uncle, a cousin still surviving who must have used the same expression. as i never knew any relative of the verdurins, i have never been able to reconstruct the word. all i know is that it certainly drew a smile from mme. verdurin, for the use of this language less general, more personal, more secret, than their everyday speech inspires in those who use it among themselves a sense of self-importance which is always accompanied by a certain satisfaction. after this moment of mirth: “but if cottard talks,” mme. verdurin objected. “he will not talk.” he did mention it, to myself at least, for it was from him that i learned of this incident a few years later, actually at the funeral of saniette. i was sorry that i had not known of it earlier. for one thing the knowledge would have brought me more rapidly to the idea that we ought never to feel resentment towards other people, ought never to judge them by some memory of an unkind action, for we do not know all the good that, at other moments, their hearts may have sincerely desired and realised; no doubt the evil form which we have established once and for all will recur, but the heart is far more rich than that, has many other forms that will recur, also, to these people, whose kindness we refuse to admit because of the occasion on which they behaved badly. furthermore, this revelation by cottard must inevitably have had an effect upon me, because by altering my opinion of the verdurins, this revelation, had it been made to me earlier, would have dispelled the suspicions that i had formed as to the part that the verdurins might be playing between albertine and myself, would have dispelled them, wrongly perhaps as it happened, for if m. verdurin — whom i supposed, with increasing certainty, to be the most malicious man alive — had certain virtues, he was nevertheless tormenting to the point of the most savage persecution, and so jealous of his domination over the little clan as not to shrink from the basest falsehoods, from the fomentation of the most unjustified hatreds, in order to sever any ties between the faithful which had not as their sole object the strengthening of the little group. he was a man capable of disinterested action, of unostentatious generosity, that does not necessarily mean a man of feeling, nor a pleasant man, nor a scrupulous, nor a truthful, nor always a good man. a partial goodness, in which there persisted, perhaps, a trace of the family whom my great-aunt had known, existed probably in him in view of this action before i discovered it, as america or the north pole existed before columbus or peary. nevertheless, at the moment of my discovery, m. verdurin’s nature offered me a new and unimagined aspect; and so i am brought up against the difficulty of presenting a permanent image as well of a character as of societies and passions. for it changes no less than they, and if we seek to portray what is relatively unchanging in it, we see it present in succession different aspects (implying that it cannot remain still but keeps moving) to the disconcerted artistembed"

"chapter 19: surprises lyricshelen keller had said in 1911: ""we vote? what does that mean?"" and emma goldman around the same time: ""our modern fetish is universal suffrage."" after 1920, women were voting, as men did, and their subordinate condition had hardly changed.  right after women got the vote, the measure of their social progress can he seen in an advice column written by dorothy dix that appeared in newspapers all over the country. the woman should not merely be a domestic drudge, she said:  ... a man's wife is the show window where he exhibits the measure of his achievement... . the biggest deals are put across over luncheon tables;... we meet at dinner the people who can push our fortunes... . the woman who cultivates a circle of worthwhile people, who belongs to clubs, who makes herself interesting and agreeable ... is a help to her husband.  robert and helen lynd, studying muncie, indiana (middletown), in the late twenties, noted the importance of good looks and dress in the assessment of women. also, they found that when men spoke frankly among themselves they were ""likely to speak of women as creatures purer and morally better than men but as relatively impractical, emotional, unstable, given to prejudice, easily hurt, and largely incapable of facing facts or doing hard thinking.""  a writer in early 1930, boosting the beauty business, started off a magazine article with the sentence: ""the average american woman has sixteen square feet of skin."" he went on to say that there were forty thousand beauty shops in the country, and that $2 billion was spent each year on cosmetics for women—but this was insufficient: ""american women are not yet spending even one- fifth of the amount necessary to improve their appearance."" he then gave an itemized list of the ""annual beauty needs of every woman"": twelve hot-oil treatments, fifty-two facials, twenty-six eyebrow plucks, etc.  it seems that women have best been able to make their first escape from the prison of wifeliness, motherhood, femininity, housework, beautification, isolation, when their services have been desperately needed-whether in industry, or in war, or in social movements. each time practicality pulled the woman out of her prison-in a kind of work-parole program-the attempt was made to push her back once the need was over, and this led to women's struggle for change. world war ii had brought more women than ever before out of the home into work. by 1960, 36 percent of all women sixteen and older- 23 million women-worked for paid wages. but although 43 percent of women with school-age children worked, there were nursery schools for only 2 percent- the rest had to work things out themselves. women were 50 percent of the voters-but (even by 1967) they held 4 percent of the state legislative seats, and 2 percent of the judgeships. the median income of the working woman was about one-third that of the man. and attitudes toward women did not seem to have changed much since the twenties.  ""there is no overt anti-feminism in our society in 1964,"" wrote feminist and sociologist alice rossi, ""not because sex equality has been achieved, but because there is practically no feminist spark left among american women.""  in the civil rights movement of the sixties, the signs of a collective stirring began to appear. women took the place they customarily took in social movements, in the front lines-as privates, not generals. in the office of the student nonviolent coordinating committee in atlanta, a spelman college student named ruby doris smith, who had been jailed during the sit-ins, expressed their anger at the way women were relegated to the routine office work, and she was joined in her protest by two white women in sncc, sandra hayden and mary king. the men in sncc listened to them respectfully, read the position paper they had put together asserting their rights, but did not do very much. ella baker, a veteran fighter from harlem, now organizing in the south, knew the pattern: ""i knew from the beginning that as a woman, an older woman in a group of ministers who are accustomed to having women largely as supporters, there was no place for me to have come into a leadership role.""  nevertheless, women played a crucial role in those early dangerous years of organizing in the south, and were looked on with admiration. many of these were older women like ella baker, and amelia boynton in selma, alabama, and ""mama dolly"" in albany, georgia. younger women- gloria richardson in maryland, annelle ponder in mississippi-were not only active, but leaders. women of all ages demonstrated, went to jail. mrs. fannie lou hamer, a sharecropper in ruleville, mississippi, became legendary as organizer and speaker. she sang hymns; she walked picket lines with her familiar limp (as a child she contracted polio). she roused people to excitement at mass meetings: ""i'm sick an' tired o' bein' sick an' tired!""  around the same time, white, middle-class, professional women were beginning to speak up. a pioneering, early book, strong and influential, was betty friedan's the feminine mystique.  just what was the problem that has no name? what were the words women used when they tried to express it? sometimes a woman would say ""i feel empty somehow . . . incomplete."" or she would say, ""i feel as if i don't exist."" sometimes.... ""a tired feeling ... i get so angry with the children it scares me. ... i feel like crying without any reason.""  friedan wrote out of her experience as a middle-class housewife, but what she spoke about touched something inside all women:  the problem lay buried, unspoken for many years in the minds of american women. it was a strange stirring, -a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the twentieth century in the united states. each suburban wire struggled with it alone. as she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slip-cover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured cub scouts and brownies, lay beside her husband at night-she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question- ""is this all?""...  but on an april morning in 1959, i heard a mother of four, having coffee with four other mothers in a suburban development fifteen miles from new york, say in a tone of quiet desperation, ""the problem."" and the others knew, without words, that she was not talking about a problem with her husband, or her children, or her home. suddenly they realized they all shared the same problem, the problem that has no name. they began, hesitantly, to talk about it. later, after they had picked up their children at nursery school and taken them home to nap, two of the women cried, in sheer relief, just to know they were not alone.  the ""mystique"" that friedan spoke of was the image of the woman as mother, as wife, living through her husband, through her children, giving up her own dreams for that. she concluded: ""the only way for a woman, as for a man, to find herself, to know herself as a person, is by creative work of her own.""  in the summer of 1964, in mccomb, mississippi, at a freedom house (a civil rights headquarters where people worked and lived together) the women went on strike against the men who wanted them to cook and make beds while the men went around in cars organizing. the stirring that friedan spoke of was true of women everywhere, it seemed.  by 1969, women were 40 percent of the entire labor force of the united states, but a substantial number of these were secretaries, cleaning women, elementary school teachers, saleswomen, waitresses, and nurses. one out of every three working women had a husband earning less than $5,000 a year.  what of the women who didn't have jobs? they worked very hard, at home, but this wasn't looked on as work, because in a capitalist society (or perhaps in any modern society where things and people are bought and sold for money), if work is not paid for, not given a money value, it is considered valueless. women began to think more about this fact in the 1960s, and margaret benston wrote about it (""the political economy of women's liberation""), women doing housework were people outside the modern economic system, therefore they were like serfs or peasants, she said. the women who worked in the typical ""woman's job""-secretary, receptionist, typist, salesperson, cleaning woman, nurse-were treated to the full range of humiliations that men in subordinate positions faced at work, plus another set of humiliations stemming from being a woman: gibes at their mental processes, sexual jokes and aggression, invisibility except as sexual objects, cold demands for more efficiency. a commercial ""guide to clerical times standards"" printed a question-and-answer column:  q. i'm a businessman, and my secretary seems to move entirely too slowly. how many times a minute should she be able to open and close a file drawer? a. exactly 25 times. times for other ""open and close operations"" ... are .04 minutes for opening or closing a folder, and .026 minutes for opening a standard center desk drawer. if you're worried about her ""chair activity,"" clock her against these standards: ""got up from chair,"" .033 minutes; ""turn in swivel chair,"" .009 minutes.  a woman factory worker in new bedford, massachusetts, in the early seventies, in a medium-sized corporation whose president's dividends from the corporation in 1970 amounted to $325,000, wrote in an organizing newspaper that 9 percent of the workers in her department were women, but all the supervisors were men.  a few years ago i was suspended for three days from work because my children were still young and i had to take time off when they were sick. . . . they want people who keep quiet, squeal on one another, and are very good little robots. the fact that many have to take nerve pills before starting their day, and a week doesn't go by that there aren't two or three people who break down and cry, doesn't mean a thing to them.  she added: ""but times are changing, and from now on, more people will speak out and demand from their so-called bosses that they be treated the way the bosses themselves would like to he treated.""  times indeed were changing. around 1967, women in the various movements-civil rights, students for a democratic society, antiwar groups-began meeting as women, and in early 1968, at a women's antiwar meeting in washington, hundreds of women carrying torches paraded to the arlington national cemetery and staged ""the burial of traditional womanhood."" at this point, and later too, there was some disagreement among women, and even more among men, on whether women should battle on specifically women's issues, or just take part in general movements against racism, war, capitalism. but the idea of a feminist focus grew.  in the fall of 1968, a group called radical women attracted national attention when they protested the selection of miss america, which they called ""an image that oppresses women."" they all threw bras, girdles, curlers, false eyelashes, wigs, and other things they called ""women's garbage"" into a freedom trash can. a sheep was crowned miss america. more important, people were beginning to speak of ""women's liberation.""  some of the new york radical women shortly afterward formed witch (women's international terrorist conspiracy from hell), and its members, dressed as witches, appeared suddenly on the floor of the new york stock exchange. a leaflet put out by witch in new york said:  witch lives and laughs in every woman. she is the free part of each of us, beneath the shy smiles, the acquiescence to absurd male domination, the make-up or flesh-suffocating clothes our sick society demands. there is no ""joining"" witch. if you are a woman and dare to look within yourself, you are a witch. you make your own rules.  witch in washington, d.c., protested at the united fruit company for the corporation's activities in the third world and its treatment of its women office workers. in chicago it protested the firing of a radical feminist teacher named marlene dixon.  poor women, black women, expressed the universal problem of women in their own way. in 1964 robert coles (children of crisis) interviewed a black woman from the south recently moved to boston, who spoke of the desperation of her life, the difficulty of finding happiness: ""to me, having a baby inside me is the only lime i'm really alive.""  without talking specifically about their problems as women, many women, among the poor, did as they had always done, quietly organized neighborhood people to right injustices, to get needed services. in the mid-1960s, ten thousand black people in a community in atlanta called vine city joined together to help one another: they set up a thrift shop, a nursery, a medical clinic, monthly family suppers, a newspaper, a family counseling service. one of the organizers, helen howard, told gerda lerner (black women in white america) about it:  i organized this neighborhood organization, two men and six ladies started it. that was a hard pull. a lot of people joined in later. for about five months we had meetings pretty near every night. we learned how to work with other people. ... a lot of people were afraid to really do anything. you were afraid to go to the city hall or ask for anything. you didn't even ask the landlord for anything, you were afraid of him. then we had meetings and then we weren't afraid so much anymore. . . . the way we got this playground: we blocked off the street, wouldn't let anything come through. we wouldn't let the trolley bus come through. the whole neighborhood was in it. took record players and danced; it went on for a week. we didn't get arrested, they was too many of us. so then the city put up this playground for the kids. ...  a woman named patricia robinson wrote a pamphlet called poor black woman, in which she connected the problems of women with the need for basic social change:  rebellion by poor black women, the bottom of a class hierarchy heretofore not discussed, places the question of what kind of society will the poor black woman demand and struggle for. already she demands the right to have birth control, like middle class black and white women. she is aware that it takes two to oppress and that she and other poor people no longer are submitting to oppression, in this case genocide. she allies herself with the have-nots in the wider world and their revolutionary struggles. she had been forced by historical conditions to withdraw the children from male dominance and to educate and support them herself. in this very process, male authority and exploitation are seriously weakened. further, she realizes that the children will be used as all poor children have been used through history-as poorly paid mercenaries fighting to keep or put an elite group in power. through these steps .. . she has begun to question aggressive male domination and the class society which enforces it, capitalism.  in 1970, dorothy bolden, a laundry worker in atlanta and mother of six, told why in 1968 she began organizing women doing housework, into the national domestic workers union. she said: ""i think women should have a voice in making decisions in their community for betterment. because this woman in the slum is scuffling hard, and she's got a very good intelligent mind to do things, and she's been overlooked for so many years. i think she should have a voice.""  women tennis players organized. a woman fought to be a jockey, won her case, became the first woman jockey. women artists picketed the whitney museum, charging sex discrimination in a sculptors' show. women journalists picketed the gridiron club in washington, which excluded women. by the start of 1974, women's studies programs existed at seventy-eight institutions, and about two thousand courses on women were being offered at about five hundred campuses.  women's magazines and newspapers began appearing, locally and nationally, and books on women's history and the movement came out in such numbers that some bookstores had special sections for them. the very jokes on television, some sympathetic, some caustic, showed how national was the effect of the movement. certain television commercials, which women felt humiliated them, were eliminated after protest.  in 1967, after lobbying by women's groups, president johnson signed an executive order banning sex discrimination in federally connected employment, and in the years that followed, women's groups demanded that this he enforced. over a thousand suits were initiated by now (national organization for women, formed in 1966) against u.s. corporations charging sex discrimination.  the right to abortion became a major issue. before 1970, about a million abortions were done every year, of which only about ten thousand were legal. perhaps a third of the women having illegal abortions- mostly poor people-had to be hospitalized for complications. how many thousands died as a result of these illegal abortions no one really knows. but the illegalization of abortion clearly worked against the poor, for the rich could manage either to have their baby or to have their abortion under safe conditions.  court actions to do away with the laws against abortions were begun in over twenty states between 1968 and 1970, and public opinion grew stronger for the right of women to decide for themselves without government interference. in the book sisterhood is powerful, an important collection of women's writing around 1970, an article by lucinda cisler, ""unfinished business: birth control,"" said that ""abortion is a woman's right ... no one can veto her decision and compel her to bear a child against her will... .""in the spring of 1969 a harris poll showed that 64 percent of those polled thought the decision on abortion was a private matter.  finally, in early 1973, the supreme court decided (roe v. wade, doe v. bolton) that the state could prohibit abortions only in the last three months of pregnancy, that it could regulate abortion for health purposes during the second three months of pregnancy, and during the first three months, a woman and her doctor had the right to decide.  there was a push for child care centers, and although women did not succeed in getting much help from government, thousands of cooperative child care centers were set up.  women also began to speak openly, for the first time, about the problem of rape. each year, fifty thousand rapes were reported and many more were unreported. women began taking self-defense courses. there were protests against the way police treated women, interrogated them, insulted them, when women filed rape charges. a book by susan brownmiller, against our will, was widely read-it is a powerful, indignant history and analysis of rape, suggesting self-defense, individual or collective:  fighting back. on a multiplicity of levels, that is the activity we must engage in, together, if we- women-are to redress the imbalance and rid ourselves and men of the ideology of rape. rape can be eradicated, not merely controlled or avoided on an individual basis, but the approach must be long- range and cooperative, and must have the understanding and good will of many men as well as women... .  many women were active in trying to get a constitutional amendment, era (equal rights amendment), passed by enough states. but it seemed clear that even if it became law, it would not be enough, that what women had accomplished had come through organization, action, protest. even where the law was helpful it was helpful only if backed by action. shirley chisholm, a black congresswoman, said:  the law cannot do it for us. we must do it for ourselves. women in this country must become revolutionaries. we must refuse to accept the old, the traditional roles and stereotypes.... we must replace the old, negative thoughts about our femininity with positive thoughts and positive action....  perhaps the most profound effect of the women's movement of the sixties-beyond the actual victories on abortion, in job equality-was called ""consciousness raising,"" often done in ""women's groups,"" which met in homes all across the country. this meant the rethinking of roles, the rejection of inferiority, the confidence in self, a bond of sisterhood, a new solidarity of mother and daughter. the atlanta poet esta seaton wrote ""her life"":  this is the picture that keeps forming in my mind: my young mother, barely seventeen, cooking their kosher dinner on the coal stove, that first winter in vermont, and my father, mute in his feelings except when he shouted, eating to show his love.  fifty years later her blue eyes would grow cold with the shock of that grey house and the babies one after another and the doctor who said ""if you don't want any more children move out of the house.""  for the first time, the sheer biological uniqueness of women was openly discussed. some theorists (shulamith firestone, in the dialectics of sex, for instance) thought this was more fundamental to their oppression than any particular economic system. it was liberating to talk frankly about what had for so long been secret, hidden, cause for shame and embarrassment: menstruation, masturbation, menopause, abortion, lesbianism.  one of the most influential books to appear in the early seventies was a book assembled by eleven women in the boston women's health book collective called our bodies, ourselves. it contained an enormous amount of practical information, on women's anatomy, on sexuality and sexual relationships, on lesbianism, on nutrition and health, on rape, self-defense, venereal disease, birth control, abortion, pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause. more important even than the information, the charts, the photos, the candid exploration of the previously unmentioned, was the mood of exuberance throughout the book, the enjoyment of the body, the happiness with the new- found understanding, the new sisterhood with young women, middle-aged women, older women. they quoted the english suffragette christabel pankhurst:  remember the dignity of your womanhood. do not appeal, do not beg, do not grovel. take courage join hands, stand beside us. fight with us. ...  the fight began, many women were saying, with the body, which seemed to be the beginning of the exploitation of women-as sex plaything (weak and incompetent), as pregnant woman (helpless), as middle-aged woman (no longer considered beautiful), as older woman (to be ignored, set aside). a biological prison had been created by men and society. as adrienne rich said (of woman born): ""women are controlled by lashing us to our bodies."" she wrote:  i have a very clear, keen memory of myself the day after i was married: i was sweeping a floor. probably the floor did not really need to be swept; probably i simply did not know what else to do with myself. but as i swept that floor i thought: ""now i am a woman. this is an age-old action, this is what women have always done."" i felt i was bending to some ancient form, too ancient to question. this is what women have always done.  as soon as i was visibly and clearly pregnant, i felt, for the first time in my adolescent and adult life, not-guilty. the atmosphere of approval in which i was bathed-even by strangers on the street, it seemed-was like an aura i carried with me, in which doubts, fears, misgivings met with absolute denial. this is what women have always done....  rich said women could use the body ""as a resource, rather than a destiny."" patriarchal systems, she said, whether under capitalism or ""socialism,"" limited women's bodies to their own needs. she discussed the training of passivity in women. generations of schoolgirls were raised on little women, where jo is told by her mother: ""i am angry nearly every day of my life, jo; but i have learned not to show it; and i still hope to learn not to feel it, though it may take me another forty years to do so.""  male doctors used instruments to bring out children, replacing the sensitive hands of midwives, in the era of ""anesthetized, technologized childbirth."" rich disagreed with her fellow feminist firestone, who wanted to change the biological inevitability of childbirth, because it is painful and a source of subordination; she wanted, under different social conditions, to make childbirth a source of physical and emotional joy.  one could not talk of freud's ignorance of women, rich said, as his one ""blind spot,"" which implied that in other matters his vision was clear; such ignorance distorts all. there is a dilemma of the body:  i know no woman-virgin, mother, lesbian, married, celibate-whether she earns her keep as a housewife, a cocktail waitress, or a scanner of brain waves-for whom her body is not a fundamental problem: its clouded meaning, its fertility, its desire, its so-called frigidity, its bloody speech, its silences, its changes and mutilations, its rapes and ripenings.  her reply to this: the ""repossession of our bodies ... a world in which every woman is the presiding genius of her own body"" as a basis for bringing forth not just children but new visions, new meanings, a new world.  for most women who were not intellectuals, the question was even more immediate: how to eliminate hunger, suffering, subordination, humiliation, in the here and now. a woman named johnnie tillmon wrote in 1972:  i'm a woman. i'm a black woman. i'm a poor woman. i'm a fat woman. i'm a middle-aged woman. and i'm on welfare... . i have raised six children.... i grew up in arkansas . .. worked there for fifteen years in a laundry .. . moved to california. ... in 1963 i got too sick to work anymore. friends helped me to go on welfare.. . .  welfare's like a traffic accident. it can happen to anybody, but especially it happens to women.  and that is why welfare is a women's issue. for a lot of middle-class women in this country, women's liberation is a matter of concern. for women on welfare it's a matter of survival.  welfare, she said, was like ""a supersexist marriage. you trade in a man for the man.... ""the man runs everything . . . controls your money. . . ."" she and other welfare mothers organized a national welfare rights organization. they urged that women be paid for their work-housekeeping, child rearing. "". .. no woman can he liberated, until all women get off their knees.""  in the problem of women was the germ of a solution, not only for their oppression, but for everybody's. the control of women in society was ingeniously effective. it was not done directly by the state. instead, the family was used-men to control women, women to control children, all to be preoccupied with one another, to turn to one another for help, to blame one another for trouble, to do violence to one another when tidings weren't going right. why could this not be turned around? could women liberating themselves, children freeing themselves, men and women beginning to understand one another, find the source of their common oppression outside rather than in one another? perhaps then they could create nuggets of strength in their own relationships, millions of pockets of insurrection. they could revolutionize thought and behavior in exactly that seclusion of family privacy which the system had counted on to do its work of control and indoctrination. and together, instead of at odds-male, female, parents, children-they could undertake the changing of society itself.  it was a time of uprisings. if there could be rebellion inside that most subtle and complex of prisons-the family-it was reasonable that there be rebellions in the most brutal and obvious of prisons: the penitentiary system itself. in the sixties and early seventies, those rebellions multiplied. they also took on an unprecedented political character and the ferocity of class war, coming to a climax at attica, new york, in september of 1971.  the prison had arisen in the united states as an attempt at quaker reform, to replace mutilation, hanging, exile-the traditional punishments during colonial times. the prison was intended, through isolation, to produce repentance and salvation, but prisoners went insane and died in that isolation. by mid-nineteenth century, the prison was based on hard labor, along with various punishments: sweat boxes, iron yokes, solitary. the approach was summed up by the warden at the ossining, new york, penitentiary: ""in order to reform a criminal you must first break his spirit."" that approach persisted.  prison officials would convene annually to congratulate themselves on the progress being made. the president of the american correctional association, delivering the annual address in 1966, described the new edition of the manual of correctional standards: ""it permits us to linger, if we will, at the gates of correctional valhalla-with an abiding pride in the sense of a job superbly done! we may be proud, we may be satisfied, we may be content."" he said this just after, in the midst of, and just before the most intense series of prison uprisings the country had ever seen.  there had always been prison riots. a wave of them in the 1920s ended with a riot at clinton, new york, a prison of 1,600 inmates, which was suppressed with three prisoners killed. between 1950 and 1953 more than fifty major riots occurred in american prisons. in the early 1960s, prisoners on a work gang in georgia smashing rocks used the same sledgehammers to break their legs, to call attention to their situation of daily brutality.  at san quentin prison in california, which housed four thousand prisoners, there was a series of revolts in the late sixties: a race riot in 1967, a united black-white general strike in early 1968 that shut down almost all the prison industries, and then a second strike that summer.  at the queens house of detention on long island in new york in the fall of 1970, prisoners took over the jail, took hostages, issued demands. the prisoners' negotiating committee included four blacks, one puerto rican, one white; they demanded immediate bail hearings on forty-seven cases that they said were examples of racism in the granting of bail. judges came inside the prison, granted some paroles and reductions, and the hostages were released. but when the prisoners continued to hold out, police stormed the jail with tear gas and clubs and the revolt was over.  around the same time, in november 1970, in folsom prison in california, a work stoppage began which became the longest prison strike in the history of the united states. most of the 2,400 prisoners held out in their cells for nineteen days, without food, in the face of threats and intimidation. the strike was broken with a combination of force and deception, and four of the prisoners were sent on a fourteen-hour ride to another prison, shackled and naked on the floor of a van. one of the rebels wrote: "". . . the spirit of awareness has grown. ... the seed has been planted. . . .""  the prisons in the united states had long been an extreme reflection of the american system itself: the stark life differences between rich and poor, the racism, the use of victims against one another, the lack of resources of the underclass to speak out, the endless ""reforms"" that changed little. dostoevski once said: ""the degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.""  it had long been true, and prisoners knew this better than anyone, that the poorer you were the more likely you were to end up in jail. this was not just because the poor committed more crimes. in fact, they did. the rich did not have to commit crimes to get what they wanted; the laws were on their side. but when the rich did commit crimes, they often were not prosecuted, and if they were they could get out on bail, hire clever lawyers, get better treatment from judges. somehow, the jails ended up full of poor black people.  in 1969, there were 502 convictions for tax fraud. such cases, called ""white-collar crimes,"" usually involve people with a good deal of money. of those convicted, 20 percent ended up in jail. the fraud averaged $190,000 per case; their sentences averaged seven months. that same year, for burglary and auto theft (crimes of the poor) 60 percent ended up in prison. the auto thefts averaged $992; the sentences averaged eighteen months. the burglaries averaged $321; the sentences averaged thirty-three months.  willard gaylin, a psychiatrist, relates (partial justice) a case which, with changes in details, could be multiplied thousands of rimes. he had just interviewed seventeen jehovah's witnesses who refused to register for the draft during the vietnam war, and all had received two-year sentences. he came to a young black man who had notified his draft board he could not in conscience cooperate with the draft because he was repelled by the violence of the vietnam war. he received a five-year sentence. gaylin writes: ""hank's was the first five-year sentence i had encountered. he was also the first black man."" there were additional factors:  ""how was your hair then?"" i asked.  ""afro.""  ""and what were you wearing?""  ""a dashiki.""  ""don't you think that might have affected your sentence?""  ""of course.""  ""was it worth a year or two of your life?"" i asked.  ""that's all of my life,"" he said, looking at me with a combination of dismay and confusion. ""man, don't you know! that's what it's all about! am i free to have my style, am i free to have my hair, am i free to have my skin?""  ""of course,"" i said. ""you're right.""  gaylin found enormous discretion given to judges in the handing out of sentences. in oregon, of thirty-three men convicted of violating the draft law, eighteen were put on probation. in southern texas, of sixteen men violating the same law, none was put on probation, and in southern mississippi, every defendant was convicted and given the maximum of five years. in one part of the country (new england), the average sentence for all crimes was eleven months; in another part (the south), it was seventy-eight months. but it wasn't simply a matter of north and south. in new york city, one judge handling 67? persons brought before him for public drunkenness (all poor; the rich get drank behind closed doors) discharged 531 of them. another judge, handling 566 persons on the same charge, discharged one person.  with such power in the hands of the courts, the poor, the black, the odd, the homosexual, the hippie, the radical are not likely to get equal treatment before judges who are almost uniformly white, upper middle class, orthodox.  while in any one year (1972, for instance) perhaps 375,000 people will be in jail (county or city) or in prisons (state or federal), and 54,000 in juvenile detention, there will also be 900,000 under probation and 300,000 on parole-a total of 1,600,000 people affected by the criminal justice system. considering turnover, in any one year, several million people will come in and go out of this system. it is a population largely invisible to middle-class america, but if 20 million blacks could be invisible for so long, why not four or five million ""criminals""? a study by the children's defense fund (thomas cottle, children in jail) in the mid-seventies revealed that more than 900,000 young people under eighteen are jailed in the course of a year.  anyone trying to describe the reality of prison falters. a man in walpole prison in massachusetts wrote:  every program that we get is used as a weapon against us. the right to go to school, to go to church, to have visitors, to write, to go to the movies. they all end up being weapons of punishment. none of the programs are ours, everything is treated as a privilege that can be taken away from us. the result is insecurity-a frustration that keeps eating away at you.  another walpole prisoner:  i haven't eaten in the mess hall for four years. i just couldn't take it any more. you'd go into the serving line in the morning and 100 or 200 cockroaches would go running away from the trays. the trays were grimy and the food was raw or had dirt or maggots in it.  many a night i'd go hungry, living on peanut butter and sandwiches, getting a loaf of bread here or a hunk of bologna there. other guys couldn't do that because they didn't have my connections or they didn't have money for the canteen.  communication with the outside world was difficult. guards would tear up letters. others would be intercepted and read. jerry sousa, a prisoner at walpole in 1970, sent two letters-one to a judge, the other to the parole board-to tell about a bearing by guards. they went unanswered. eight years later, at a court hearing, he discovered the prison authorities had intercepted them, never sent them out.  the families suffered with the prisoner: ""during the last lock-up my four-year-old son sneaked off into the yard and picked me a flower. a guard in the tower called the warden's office and a deputy came in with the state police at his side. he announced that if any child went into the yard and picked another flower, all visits would be terminated.""  the prison rebellions of the late sixties and early seventies had a distinctly different character than the earlier ones. the prisoners in the queens house of detention referred to themselves as ""revolutionaries."" all over the country, prisoners were obviously affected by the turmoil in the country, the black revolt, the youth upsurge, the antiwar movement.  the events of those years underlined what prisoners already sensed-that whatever crimes they had committed, the greatest crimes were being committed by the authorities who maintained the prisons, by the government of the united states. the law was being broken daily by the president, sending bombers to kill, sending men to be killed, outside the constitution, outside the ""highest law of the land."" state and local officials were violating the civil rights of black people, which was against the law, and were not being prosecuted for it.  literature about the black movement, books on the war, began to seep into the prisons. the example set in the streets by blacks, by antiwar demonstrators, was exhilarating-against a lawless system, defiance was the only answer.  it was a system which sentenced martin sostre, a fifty-two-year-old black man running an afro- asian bookstore in buffalo, new york, to twenty-five to thirty years in prison for allegedly selling $15 worth of heroin to an informer who later recanted his testimony. the recantation did not free sostre-he could find no court, including the supreme court of the united states, to revoke the judgment. he spent eight years in prison, was beaten ten times by guards, spent three years in solitary confinement, battling and defying the authorities all the way until his release. such injustice deserved only rebellion.  there had always been political prisoners-people sent to jail for belonging to radical movements, for opposing war. but now a new kind of political prisoner appeared-the man, or woman, convicted of an ordinary crime, who, in prison, became awakened politically. some prisoners began making connections between their personal ordeal and the social system. they then turned not to individual rebellion but to collective action. they became concerned-amid an environment whose brutality demanded concentration on one's own safety, an atmosphere of cruel rivalry-for the rights, the safety of others.  george jackson was one of these new political prisoners. in soledad prison, california, on an indeterminate sentence for a $70 robbery, having already served ten years of it, jackson became a revolutionary. he spoke with a fury that matched his condition:  this monster-the monster they've engendered in me will return to torment its maker, from the grave, the pit, the profoundest pit. hurl me into the next existence, the descent into hell won't turn me.. .. i'm going to charge them reparations in blood. i'm going to charge them like a maddened, wounded, rogue male elephant, ears flared, trunk raised, trumpet blaring. . .. war without terms.  a prisoner like this would not last. and when his book soledad brother became one of the most widely read books of black militancy in the united states-by prisoners, by black people, by white people-perhaps this ensured he would not last.  all my life i've done exactly what i wanted to do just when i wanted, no more, perhaps less sometimes, but never any more, which explains why i had to be jailed.... i never adjusted. i haven't adjusted even yet, with half of my life already in prison.  he knew what might happen:  born to a premature death, a menial, subsistence-wage worker, odd-job man, the cleaner, the caught, the man under hatches, without bail-that's me, the colonial victim. anyone who can pass the civil service examination today can kill me tomorrow ... with complete immunity.  in august 1971 he was shot in the back by guards at san quentin prison while he was allegedly trying to escape. the state's story (analyzed by eric mann in comrade george) was full of holes. prisoners in jails and state prisons all over the country knew, even before the final autopsy was in, even before later disclosures suggested a government plot to kill jackson, that he had been murdered for daring to be a revolutionary in prison. shortly after jackson's death, there was a chain of rebellions around the country, in san jose civic center jail, in dallas county jail, in suffolk county jail in boston, in cumberland county jail in bridgeton, new jersey, in bexar county jail in san antonio, texas.  the most direct effect of the george jackson murder was the rebellion at attica prison in september 1971-a rebellion that came from long, deep grievances, but that was raised to boiling point by the news about george jackson. attica was surrounded by a 30-foot wall, 2 feet thick, with fourteen gun towers. fifty-four percent of the inmates were black; 100 percent of the guards were white. prisoners spent fourteen to sixteen hours a day in their cells, their mail was read, their reading material restricted, their visits from families conducted through a mesh screen, their medical care disgraceful, their parole system inequitable, racism everywhere. how perceptive the prison administration was about these conditions can be measured by the comment of the superintendent of attica, vincent mancusi, when the uprising began: ""why are they destroying their home?""  most of the attica prisoners were there as a result of plea bargaining. of 32,000 felony indictments a year in new york state, 4,000 to 5,000 were tried. the rest (about 75 percent) were disposed of by deals made under duress, called ""plea bargaining,"" described as follows in the report of the joint legislative committee on crime in new york:  the final climactic act in the plea bargaining procedure is a charade which in itself has aspects of dishonesty which rival the original crime in many instances. the accused is made to assert publicly his guilt on a specific crime, which in many cases he has not committed; in some cases he pleads guilty to a non-existing crime. he must further indicate that he is entering his plea freely . ., and that he is not doing so because of any promises ... made to him.  in plea bargaining, the accused pleads guilty, whether he is or not, and saves the state the trouble of a trial in return for the promise of a less severe punishment.  when attica prisoners were up for parole, the average time of their hearing, including the reading of the file and deliberation among the three members, was 5.9 minutes. then the decision was handed out, with no explanation.  the official report on the attica uprising tells how an inmate instructed sociology class there became a forum for ideas about change. then there was a series of organized protest efforts, and in july an inmate manifesto setting forth a series of moderate demands, after which ""tensions at attica had continued to mount,"" culminating in a day of protest over the killing of george jackson at san quentin, during which few inmates ate at lunch and dinner and many wore black armbands.  on september 9, 1971, a series of conflicts between prisoners and guards ended with a group of inmates breaking through a gate with a defective weld and taking over one of the four prison yards, with forty guards as hostages. then followed five days in which the prisoners set up a remarkable community in the yard. a group of citizen-observers, invited by the prisoners, included new york times columnist tom wicker, who wrote (a time to die): ""the racial harmony that prevailed among the prisoners-it was absolutely astonishing.... that prison yard was the first place i have ever seen where there was no racism."" one black prisoner later said: ""i never thought whites could really get it on.... but i can't tell you what the yard was like, i actually cried it was so close, everyone so together. ...""  after five days, the state lost patience. governor nelson rockefeller approved a military attack on the prison (see cinda firestone's stunning film attica). national guardsmen, prison guards, and local police went in with automatic rifles, carbines, and submachine guns in a full-scale assault on the prisoners, who had no firearms. thirty-one prisoners were killed. the first stories given the press by prison authorities said that nine guards held hostage had their throats slashed by the prisoners during the attack. the official autopsies almost immediately showed this to be false: the nine guards died in the same hail of bullets that killed the prisoners.  the effects of attica are hard to measure. two months after the revolt at attica, men at norfolk prison in massachusetts began to organize. on november 8, 1971, armed guards and state troopers, in a surprise raid, moved into the cells at norfolk, pulled out sixteen men, and shipped them out. a prisoner described the scene:  between one and two last night i was awakened (i've been a light sleeper since vietnam) and i looked out my window. there were troopers. and screws. lots. armed with sidearms, and big clubs. they were going into dorms and taking people, all kinds of people.. . .  they took a friend of mine. ... being pulled outside in our underwear, at 1:30, in bare feet by two troopers and a housescrew. looking at those troops, with guns, and masks and clubs, with the moon shining off the helmets and the hate that you could see in their faces. thinking that this is where these guys live, with the guns and the hate, and the helmets and masks, and you, you're trying to wake up, flashing on kent state and jackson, and chicago. and attica. most of all, attica... .  that same week at concord prison in massachusetts, another raid. it was as if everywhere, in the weeks and months after attica, the authorities were taking preventive action to break up organizing efforts among the prisoners. jerry sousa, a young leader of the prison reform movement at concord, was taken away, dumped into walpole in the middle of the night, and immediately put into nine block, the dreaded segregation unit. he had been there only a short time when he managed to get a report out to friends. the content of this report tells much about what was happening before and after attica to the thinking of prisoners:  we are writing a somber report regarding the circumstances and events leading up to and surrounding the death of prisoner joseph chesnulavich which occurred here an hoar ago in nine block.  since christmas eve, vicious prison guards here in nine block have created a reign of terror directed toward us prisoners. four of us have been beaten, one who was prisoner donald king.  in an attempt to escape constant harassment and inhuman treatment, prisoner george hayes ate razor blades and prisoner fred ahem swallowed a needle . .. they both were rushed to mass general hospital.  this evening at 6 p.m. prison guards baptist, sainsbury, and montiega turned a fire extinguisher containing a chemical foam on joe then slammed the solid steel door sealing him in his cell and walked away, voicing threats of, ""we'll get that punk.""  at 9:25 p.m. joe was found dead. . .. prison authorities as well as news media will label little joe's death a suicide, but the men here in block nine who witnessed this murder know. but are we next?  what was happening was the organization of prisoners-the caring of prisoners for one another, the attempt to take the hatred and anger of individual rebellion and turn it into collective effort for change. on the outside, something new was also happening, the development of prison support groups all over the country, the building of a body of literature about prisons. there were more studies of crime and punishment, a growing movement for the abolition of prisons on the grounds that they did not prevent crime or cure it, but expanded it. alternatives were discussed: community houses in the short run (except for the incorrigibly violent); guaranteed minimum economic security, in the long run.  the prisoners were thinking about issues beyond prison, victims other than themselves and their friends. in walpole prison a statement asking for american withdrawal from vietnam was circulated; it was signed by every single prisoner-an amazing organizing feat by a handful of inmates. one thanksgiving day there, most of the prisoners, not only in walpole but in three other prisons, refused to eat the special holiday meal, saying they wanted to bring attention to the hungry all over the united states.  prisoners worked laboriously on lawsuits, and some victories were won in the courts. the publicity around attica, the community of support, had its effect. although the attica rebels were indicted on heavy charges and faced double and triple life terms, the charges were finally dropped. but in general, the courts declared their unwillingness to enter the closed, controlled world of the prison, and so the prisoners remained as they had been so long, on their own.  even where an occasional ""victory"" came in the courts it turned out, on close reading, to leave things not much different. in 1973 (procunier v. martinez) the u.s. supreme court declared unconstitutional certain mail censorship regulations of the california department of corrections. but when one looked closely, the decision, with all its proud language about ""first amendment liberties,"" said: ""... we hold that censorship of prison mail is justified if the following criteria are met. ..."" when the censorship could be said to ""further an important or substantial government interest"" or where it was in the ""substantial governmental interests of security, order, and rehabilitation,"" censorship would be allowed.  in 1978 the supreme court ruled that the news media do not have guaranteed rights of access to jails and prisons. it ruled also that prison authorities could forbid inmates to speak to one another, assemble, or spread literature about the formation of a prisoners' union.  it became clear-and prisoners seemed to know this from the start- that their condition would not be changed by law, but by protest, organization, resistance, the creation of their own culture, their own literature, the building of links with people on the outside. there were more outsiders now who knew about prisons. tens of thousands of americans had spent time behind bars in the civil rights and antiwar movements. they had learned about the prison system and could hardly forget their experiences. there was a basis now for breaking through the long isolation of the prisoners from the community and finding support there. in the mid-seventies, tills was beginning to happen.  it was a time of upsurge. women, guarded in their very homes, rebelled. prisoners, put out of sight and behind bars, rebelled. the greatest surprise was still to come.  it was thought that the indians, once the only occupants of the continent, then pushed back and annihilated by the white invaders, would not be heard from again. in the last days of the year 1890, shortly after christmas, the last massacre of indians took place at pine ridge, south dakota, near wounded knee creek. sitting bull, the great sioux leader, had just been assassinated by indian police in the pay of the united states, and the remaining sioux sought refuge at pine ridge, 120 men and 230 women and children, surrounded by u.s. cavalry, with two hotchkiss guns-capable of hurling shells over 2 miles-on a rise overlooking the camp. when the troopers ordered the indians to turn over their weapons, one of them fired his rifle. the soldiers then let loose with their carbines, and the big guns on the hill shelled the tepees. when it was over between 200 and 300 of the original 350 men, women, and children were dead. the twenty-five soldiers who died were mostly hit by their own shrapnel or bullets, since the indians had only a few guns.  the indian tribes, attacked, subdued, starved out, had been divided up by putting them on reservations where they lived in poverty. in 1887, an allotment act tried to break up the reservations into small plots of land owned by individual indians, to turn them into american-type small farmers-but much of this land was taken by white speculators, and the reservations remained.  then, during the new deal, with a friend of the indians, john collier, in charge of the bureau of indian affairs, there was an attempt to restore tribal life. but in the decades that followed, no fundamental change took place. many indians stayed on the impoverished reservations. the younger ones often left. an indian anthropologist said; ""an indian reservation is the most complete colonial system in the world that i know about.""  for a time, the disappearance or amalgamation of the indians seemed inevitable-only 300,000 were left at the turn of the century, from the original million or more in the area of the united states. but then the population began to grow again, as if a plant left to the refused to do so, began to flourish. by 1960 there were 800,000 indians, half on reservations, half in towns all over the country.  the autobiographies of indians show their refusal to be absorbed by the white man's culture. one wrote:  oh, yes, i went to the white man's schools. i learned to read from school books, newspapers, and the bible. but in time i found that these were not enough. civilized people depend too much on man-made printed pages. i turn to the great spirit's book which is the whole of his creation.. ..  a hopi indian named sun chief said:  i had learned many english words and could recite part of the ten commandments. i knew how to sleep on a bed, pray to jesus, comb my hair, eat with a knife and fork, and use a toilet. ... i had also learned that a person thinks with his head instead of his heart.  chief luther standing bear, in his 1933 autobiography, from the land of the spotted eagle, wrote:  true, the white man brought great change. but the varied fruits of his civilization, though highly colored and inviting, are sickening and deadening. and if it be the part of civilization to maim, rob, and thwart, then what is progress?  i am going to venture that the man who sat on the ground in his tip! meditating on life and its meaning, accepting- the kinship of all creatures, and acknowledging unity with the universe of things, was infusing into his being the true essence of civilization... .  as the civil rights and antiwar movements developed in the 1960s, indians were already gathering their energy for resistance, thinking about how to change their situation, beginning to organize. in 1961, five hundred tribal and urban indian leaders met in chicago. out of this came another gathering of university-educated young indians who formed the national indian youth council. mel thorn, a paiute indian, their first president, wrote:  there is increased activity over on the indian side. there are disagreements, laughing, singing, outbursts of anger, and occasionally some planning.... indians are gaining confidence and courage that their cause is right.  the struggle goes on. .. . indians are gathering together to deliberate their destiny... .  around this time, indians began to approach the united states government on an embarrassing topic: treaties. in his widely read 1969 book, custer died for your sins, vine deloria, jr., noted that president lyndon johnson talked about america's ""commitments,"" and president nixon talked about russia's failure to respect treaties. he said: ""indian people laugh themselves sick when they hear these statements.""  the united states government had signed more than four hundred treaties with indians and violated every single one. for instance, back in george washington's administration, a treaty was signed with the iroquois of new york: ""the united states acknowledge all the land within the aforementioned boundaries to be the property of the seneka nation. . .."" but in the early sixties, under president kennedy, the united states ignored the treaty and built a dam on this land, flooding most of the seneca reservation.  resistance was already taking shape in various parts of the country. in the state of washington, there was an old treaty taking land from the indians but leaving them fishing rights. this became unpopular as the white population grew and wanted the fishing areas exclusively for themselves. when state courts closed river areas to indian fishermen, in 1964, indians had ""fish-ins"" on the nisqually river, in defiance of the court orders, and went to jail, hoping to publicize their protest.  a local judge the following year ruled that the puyallup tribe did not exist, and its members could not fish on the river named for them, the puyallup river. policemen raided indian fishing groups, destroyed boats, slashed nets, manhandled people, arrested seven indians. a supreme court ruling in 1968 confirmed indian rights under the treaty but said a state could ""regulate all fishing"" if it did not discriminate against indians. the state continued to get injunctions and to arrest indians fishing. they were doing to the supreme court ruling what whites in the south had done with the fourteenth amendment for many years- ignoring it. protests, raids, arrests, continued into the early seventies.  some of the indians involved in the fish-ins were veterans of the vietnam war. one was sid mills, who was arrested in a fish-in at frank's landing on the nisqually river in washington on october 13, 1968. he made a statement:  i am a yakima and cherokee indian, and a man. for two years and four months, i've been a soldier in the united states army. i served in combat in vietnam-until critically wounded.... i hereby renounce further obligation in service or duty to the united states army.  my first obligation now lies with the indian people fighting for the lawful treaty to fish in usual and accustomed water of the nisqualiy, columbia and other rivers of the pacific northwest, and in serving them in this fight in any way possible. ...  my decision is influenced by the fact that we have already buried indian fishermen returned dead from vietnam, while indian fishermen live here without protection and under steady attack... .  just three years ago today, on october 13, 1965, 19 women and children were brutalized by more than 45 armed agents of the state of washington at frank's landing on the nisqually river in a vicious, unwarranted attack. ...  interestingly, the oldest human skeletal remains ever found in the western hemisphere were recently uncovered on the hanks of the columbia river-the remains of indian fishermen. what kind of government or society would spend millions of dollars to pick upon our bones, restore our ancestral life patterns, and protect our ancient remains from damage-while at the same time eating upon the flesh of our living people . . . ?  we will fight for our rights.  indians fought back not only with physical resistance, but also with the artifacts of white culture- books, words, newspapers. in 1968, members of the mohawk nation at akwesasne, on the st. lawrence river between the united states and canada, began a remarkable newspaper, akwesasne notes, with news, editorials, poetry, all flaming with the spirit of defiance. mixed in with all that was an irrepressible humor. vine deloria, jr., wrote:  every now and then i am impressed with the thinking of the non-indian. i was in cleveland last year and got to talking with a non-indian about american history. he said that he was really sorry about what had happened to indians, but that there was a good reason for it. the continent had to be developed and he felt that indians had stood in the way, and thus had had to be removed. ""after all,"" he remarked, ""what did you do with the land when you had it?"" i didn't understand him until later when i discovered that the cuyahoga river running through cleveland is inflammable. so many combustible pollutants are dumped into the river that the inhabitants have to take special precautions during the summer to avoid setting it on fire. after reviewing the argument of my non- indian friend i decided that he was probably correct. whites had made better use of the land. how many indians could have thought of creating an inflammable river?  in 1969, november 9, there took place a dramatic event which focused attention on indian grievances as nothing else had. it burst through the invisibility of previous local indian protests and declared to the entire world that the indians still lived and would fight for their rights. on that day, before dawn, seventy-eight indians landed on alcatraz island in san francisco bay and occupied the island. alcatraz was an abandoned federal prison, a hated and terrible place nicknamed ""the rock."" in 1964 some young indians had occupied it to establish an indian university, but they were driven off and there was no publicity.  this time, it was different. the group was led by richard oakes, a mohawk who directed indian studies at san francisco state college, and grace thorpe, a sac and fox indian, daughter of jim thorpe, the famous indian college football star and olympic runner, jumper, hurdler. more indians landed, and by the end of november nearly six hundred of them, representing more than fifty tribes, were living on alcatraz. they called themselves ""indians of all tribes"" and issued a proclamation, ""we hold the rock."" in it they offered to buy alcatraz in glass beads and red cloth, the price paid indians for manhattan island over three hundred years earlier. they said:  we feel that this so-called alcatraz island is more than suitable for an indian reservation, as determined by the white man's own standards. by this we mean that this place resembles most indian reservations in that:  it is isolated from modern facilities, and without adequate means of transportation. it has no fresh running water. it has inadequate sanitation facilities. there are no oil or mineral rights. there is no industry and so unemployment is very great. there are no health care facilities. the soil is rocky and non-productive; and the land does not support game. there are no educational facilities. the population has always exceeded the land base. the population has always been held as prisoners and dependent upon others.  they announced they would make the island a center for native american studies for ecology: ""we will work to de-pollute the air and waters of the bay area . . . restore fish and animal life.. . .""  in the months that followed, the government cut off telephones, electricity, and water to alcatraz island. many of the indians bad to leave, but others insisted on staying. a year later they were still there, and they sent out a message to ""our brothers and sisters of all races and tongues upon our earth mother"":  we are still holding the island of alcatraz in the true names of freedom, justice and equality, because you, our brothers and sisters of this earth, have lent support to our just cause. we reach out our hands and hearts and send spirit messages to each and every one of you-we hold the rock.. . .  we have learned that violence breeds only more violence and we therefore have carried on our occupation of alcatraz in a peaceful manner, hoping that the government of these united states will also act accordingly. ...  we are a proud people! we are indians! we have observed and rejected much of what so-called civilization offers. we are indians! we will preserve our traditions and ways of life by educating our own children. we are indians! we will join hands in a unity never before put into practice. we are indians! our earth mother awaits our voices.  we are indians of all tribes! we hold the rock!  six months later, federal forces invaded the island and physically removed the indians living there.  it had been thought that the navajo indians would not be heard from again. in the mid-1800s, united states troops under ""kit"" carson burned navajo villages, destroyed their crops and orchards, forced them from their lands. but in the black mesa of new mexico they never surrendered. in the late 1960s, the peabody coal company began strip mining on their land-a ruthless excavation of the topsoil. the company pointed to a ""contract"" signed with some navajos. it was reminiscent of the ""treaties"" signed with some indians in the past that took away all indian land.  one hundred and fifty navajos met in the spring of 1969 to declare that the strip mining would pollute the water and the air, destroy the grazing land for livestock, use up their scarce water resources. a young woman pointed to a public relations pamphlet put out by the peabody coal company, showing fishing lakes, grassland, trees, and said: ""we're not going to have anything like those you see in the pictures.... what is the future going to be like for our children, our children's children?"" an elderly navajo woman, one of the organizers of the meeting, said, ""peabody's monsters are digging up the heart of our mother earth, our sacred mountain, and we also feel the pains.... i have lived here for years and i'm not about to move.""  the hopi indians were also affected by the peabody operations. they wrote to president nixon in protest:  today the sacred lands where the hopi live are being desecrated by men who seek coal and water from our soil that they may create more power for the whiteman's cities.. . . the great spirit said not to allow this to happen. . .. the great spirit said not to take from the earth-not to destroy living things. . . .  it is said by the great spirit that if a gourd of ashes is dropped upon the earth, that many men will the and that the end of this way of life is near at hand. we interpret this as the dropping of atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki. we do not want to see this happen to any place or any nation again, but instead we should turn all this energy for peaceful uses, not for war... .  in the fall of 1970, a magazine called la raza, one of the countless local publications coming out of the movements of those years to supply information ignored in the regular media, told about the pit river indians of northern california. sixty pit indians occupied land they said belonged to them; they defied the forest services when ordered to leave. one of them, darryl b. wilson, later recalled: ""as the flames danced orange making the trees come to life, and the cold creeped out of the darkness to challenge the speaking fire, and our breath came in small clouds, we spoke."" they asked the government by what treaty it claimed the land. it could point to none. they cited a federal statute (25 usca 194) that where there was a land dispute between indian and white ""the burden of proof falls on the white man.""  they had built a quonset hut, and the marshals told them it was ugly and ruined the landscape. wilson wrote later:  the whole world is rotting. the water is poisoned, the air polluted, the politics deformed, the land gutted, the forest pillaged, the shores ruined, the towns burned, the lives of the people destroyed . .. and the federals spent the best part of october trying to tell us the quonset hut was ""ugly""!  to us it was beautiful. it was the beginning of our school. the meeting place. home for our homeless. a sanctuary for those needing rest. our church. our headquarters. our business office. our symbol of approaching freedom. and it still stands.  it was also the center for the reviving of our stricken, diluted and separated culture. our beginning. it was our sun rising on a clear spring day when the sky holds no clouds. it was a good and pure thing for our heart to look upon. that small place on earth. our place.  but 150 marshals came, with machine guns, shotguns, rifles, pistols, riot sticks, mace, dogs, chains, manacles. ""the old people were frightened. the young questioned bravery. the small children were like a deer that has been shot by the thunder stick. hearts beat fast as though a race was just run in the heat of summer."" the marshals began swinging their riot sacks, and blood started flowing. wilson grabbed one marshal's club, was thrown down, manacled, and while lying face down on the ground was struck behind the head several times. a sixty-six-year-old man was beaten into unconsciousness. a white reporter was arrested, his wife beaten. they were all thrown into trucks and taken away, charged with assaulting state and federal officers and cutting trees - but not with trespassing, which might have brought into question the ownership of the land. when the episode was all over, they were still defiant.  indians who had been in the vietnam war made connections. at the ""winter soldier investigations"" in detroit, where vietnam veterans testified about their experiences, an oklahoma indian named evan haney told about his:  the same massacres happened to the indians 100 years ago. germ warfare was used then. they put smallpox in the indians' blankets. . . .  i got to know the vietnamese people and i learned they were just like us. ... what we are doing is destroying ourselves and the world.  i have grown up with racism all my life. when i was a child, watching cowboys and indians on tv i would root for the cavalry, not the indians. it was that bad. i was that far toward my own destruction. . . .  though 50 percent of the children at the country school i attended in oklahoma were indians, nothing in school, on television, or on the radio taught anything about indian culture. there were no books on indian history, not even in the library. . . .  but i knew something was wrong. i started reading and learning my own culture. . . .  i saw the indian people at their happiest when they went to alcatraz or to washington to defend their fishing rights. they at last felt like human beings.  indians began to do something about their ""own destruction"" - the annihilation of their culture. in 1969, at the first convocation of american indian scholars, indians spoke indignantly of either the ignoring or the insulting of indians in textbooks given to little children all over the united states. that year the indian historian press was founded. it evaluated four hundred textbooks in elementary and secondary schools and found that not one of them gave an accurate depiction of the indian.  a counterattack began in the schools. in early 1971, forty-five indian students at copper valley school, in glennalen, alaska, wrote a letter to their congressman opposing the alaska oil pipeline as ruinous to the ecology, a threat to the ""peace, quiet and security of our alaska.""  other americans were beginning to pay attention, to rethink their own learning. the first motion pictures attempting to redress the history of the indian appeared: one was little big man, based on a novel by thomas berger. more and more books appeared on indian history, until a whole new literature came into existence. teachers became sensitive to the old stereotypes, threw away the old textbooks, started using new material. in the spring of 1977 a teacher named jane califf, in the new york city elementary schools, told of her experiences with fourth and fifth grade students. she brought into class the traditional textbooks and asked the students to locate the stereotypes in them. she read aloud from native american writers and articles from akwesane notes, and put protest posters around the room. the children then wrote letters to the editors of the books they had read:  dear editor,  i don't like your book called the cruise of christopher columbus. i didn't like it because you said some things about indians that weren't true. . . . another thing i didn't like was on page 69, it says that christopher columbus invited the indians to spain, but what really happened was that he stole them! censearly, raymond miranda  on thanksgiving day 1970, at the annual celebration of the landing of the pilgrims, the authorities decided to do something different: invite an indian to make the celebratory speech. they found a wampanoag indian named frank james and asked him to speak. but when they saw the speech he was about to deliver, they decided they did not want it. his speech, not heard at plymouth, massachusetts, on that occasion, said, in part (the whole speech is in chronicles of american indian protest):  i speak to you as a man-a wampanoag man. ... it is with mixed emotions that i stand here to share my thoughts.. . . the pilgrims had hardly explored the shores of cape cod four days before they had robbed the graves of my ancestors, and stolen their corn, wheat, and beans. ... our spirit refuses to die. yesterday we walked the woodland paths and sandy trails. today we must walk the macadam highways and roads. we are uniting. we're standing not in our wigwams but in your concrete tent. we stand tall and proud and before too many moons pass we'll right the wrongs we have allowed to happen to us. ...  for indians there has never been a clear line between prose and poetry. when an indian studying in new mexico was praised for his poetry he said, ""in my tribe we have no poets. everyone talks in poetry."" there are, however, ""poems,"" collected in william brandon's the last americans and in the way by shirley hill witt and stan steiner.  an ashinabe ""spring poem"" translated by gerald vizenor:  as my eyes look across the prairie i feel the summer in the spring  ""snow the last"" by joseph concha:  snow comes last for it quiets down everything  this from a fifth-year group in a special navajo program in the year 1940, called ""it is not!""  the navajo reservation a lonesome place? it is not! the skies are sunny, clear blue, or grey with rain. each day is gay- in nature's way. it is not a lonesome place at all. a navajo house shabby and small? it is not! inside there's love, good laughter, and big talk. but best- it's home with an open door and room for all a castle could have no more.  in march of 1973 came a powerful affirmation that the indians of north america were still alive. on the site of the 1890 massacre, on pine ridge reservation, several hundred ogallala sioux and friends returned to the village of wounded knee to occupy it as a symbol of the demand for indian land, indian rights. the history of that event, in the words of the participants, has been captured in a rare book published by akwesasne notes (voices from wounded knee, 1973).  in the 1970s, 54 percent of the adult males on the pine ridge reservation were unemployed, one- third of the families were on welfare or pensions, alcoholism was widespread, and suicide rates were high. the life expectancy of an ogallala sioux was forty-six years. just before the wounded knee occupation, there was violence at the town of custer. an indian named wesley bad heart bull was killed by a white gas station attendant. the man was let out on $5,000 bond and indicted for manslaughter, facing a possible ten-year term. a gathering of indians to protest this led to a clash with police. the murder victim's mother, mrs. sarah bad heart bull, was arrested, on charges that called for a maximum sentence of thirty years.  on february 27, 1973, about three hundred ogallala sioux, many of them members of the new militant organization called the american indian movement (aim), entered the village of wounded knee and declared it liberated territory. ellen moves camp later said: ""we decided that we did need the american indian movement in here because our men were scared, they hung to the back. it was mostly the women that went forward and spoke out.""  within hours, more than two hundred fbi agents, federal marshals, and police of the bureau of indian affairs surrounded and blockaded the town. they had armored vehicles, automatic rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, and gas shells, and soon began firing. gladys bissonette said three weeks later: ""since we are here, in wounded knee, we've been shot at, over and over, always after dark. but last night we were hit the hardest. i guess the great spirit is with us, and no bullets find their way into our bodies. we ran through a hail of bullets one night.... we're going to hold our stand until we are completely an independent sovereign nation, ogallala sioux nation.""  after the siege began, food supplies became short. indians in michigan sent food via a plane that landed inside the encampment. the next day fbi agents arrested the pilot and a doctor from michigan who had hired the plane. in nevada, eleven indians were arrested for taking food, clothing, and medical supplies to south dakota. in mid-april three more planes dropped 1,200 pounds of food, but as people scrambled to gather it up, a government helicopter appeared overhead and fired down on them while groundfire came from all sides. frank clearwater, an indian man lying on a cot inside a church, was hit by a bullet. when his wife accompanied him to a hospital, she was arrested and jailed. clearwater died.  there were more gun battles, another death. finally, a negotiated peace was signed, in which both sides agreed to disarm (the indians had refused to disarm while surrounded by armed men, recalling the 1890 massacre). the united states government promised to investigate indian affairs, and a presidential commission would reexamine the 1868 treaty. the siege ended and 120 occupiers were arrested. the u.s. government then said that it had reexamined the 1868 treaty, found it valid, but that it was superseded by the u.s. power of ""eminent domain""-the government's power to take land.  the indians had held out for seventy-one days, creating a marvelous community inside the besieged territory. communal kitchens were set up, a health clinic, and hospital. a navajo vietnam veteran:  there's a tremendous amount of coolness considering that we're outgunned. .. . but people stay because they believe; they have a cause. that's why we lost in viet nam, cause there was no cause. we were fighting a rich man's war, for the rich man.... in wounded knee, we're doing pretty damn good, morale-wise. because we can still laugh.  messages of support had come to wounded knee from australia, finland, germany, italy, japan, england. one message came from some of the attica brothers, two of whom were indians: ""you fight for our earth mother and her children. our spirits fight with you!"" wallace black elk replied: ""little wounded knee is turned into a giant world.""  after wounded knee, in spite of the deaths, the trials, the use of the police and courts to try to break the movement, the native american movement continued.  in the akwesasne community itself, which put out akwesasne notes, the indians had always insisted their territory was separate, not to be invaded by the white man's law. one day new york state police gave three traffic tickets to a mohawk indian truck driver, and a council of indians met with a police lieutenant. at first, he insisted that he had to follow orders and give out tickets, even in akwesasne territory, although he obviously was trying to be reasonable. he finally agreed that they would not arrest an indian in the territory or even outside of it without first having a meeting with the mohawk council. the lieutenant then sat down and lit a cigar. indian chief joahquisoh, a distinguished-looking man with long hair, rose and addressed the lieutenant with a serious voice. ""there is one more thing before you go,"" he said looking straight at the lieutenant. ""i want to know,"" he said slowly, ""if you've got an extra cigar."" the meeting ended in laughter.  akwesasne notes continued to publish. on its poetry page, late autumn, 1976, appeared poems reflecting the spirit of the times, ila abernathy wrote:  i am grass growing and the sheerer of grass, i am the willow and the splitter of laths, weaver and the thing woven, marriage of willow and grass. i am frost on the land and the land's life, breath and beast and the sharp rock underfoot; in me the mountain lives, and the owl strikes, and i in them. i am the sun's twin, mover of blood and the blood lost, i am the deer and the deer's death; i am the burr in your conscience: acknowledge me.  and buffy sainte-marie:  you think i have visions because i am an indian.  i have visions because there are visions to be seen.  in the sixties and seventies, it was not just a women's movement, a prisoner's movement, an indian movement. there was general revolt against oppressive, artificial, previously unquestioned ways of living. it touched every aspect of personal life: childbirth, childhood, love, sex, marriage, dress, music, art, sports, language, food, housing, religion, literature, death, schools.  the new temper, the new behavior, shocked many americans. it created tensions. sometimes it was seen as a ""generation gap""-the younger generation moving far away from the older one in its way of life. but it seemed after a while to be not so much a matter of age-some young people remained ""straight"" while some middle-aged people were changing their ways and old people were beginning to behave in ways that astounded others.  sexual behavior went through startling changes. premarital sex was no longer a matter for silence. men and women lived together outside of marriage, and struggled for words to describe the other person when introduced: ""i want you to meet my . . . friend."" married couples candidly spoke of their affairs, and books appeared discussing ""open marriage."" masturbation could be talked about openly, even approvingly. homosexuality was no longer concealed. ""gay"" men and ""gay"" women- lesbians-organized to combat discrimination against them, to give themselves a sense of community, to overcome shame and isolation.  all this was reflected in the literature and in the mass media. court decisions overruled the local banning of books that were erotic or even pornographic. a new literature appeared (the joy of sex and others) to teach men and women how sexual fulfillment could be attained. the movies now did not hesitate to show nudity, although the motion picture industry, wanting to preserve principle as well as profit, set up a classification system (r for restricted, x for prohibited to children). the language of sex became more common both in literature and in ordinary conversation.  all this was connected with new living arrangements. especially among young people, communal living arrangements flourished. a few were truly communes-that is, based on the sharing of money and decisions, creating a community of intimacy, affection, trust. most were practical arrangements for sharing the rent, with varying degrees of friendship and intimate association among the participants. it was no longer unusual for men and women to be ""roommates""-in groups of two or three or larger, and without sexual relations-as practical, unselfconscious arrangements.  the most important thing about dress in the cultural change of the sixties was the greater informality. for women it was a continuation of the historic feminist movement's insistence on discarding of ""feminine,"" hampering clothes. many women stopped wearing bras. the restrictive ""girdle""-almost a uniform of the forties and fifties-became rare. young men and women dressed more nearly alike, in jeans, in discarded army uniforms. men stopped wearing neckties, women of all ages wore pants more often-unspoken homage to amelia bloomer.  there was a new popular music of protest. pete seeger had been singing protest songs since the forties, but now he came into his own, his audiences much larger. bob dylan and joan baez, singing not only protest songs, but songs reflecting the new abandon, the new culture, became popular idols. a middle-aged woman on the west coast, malvina reynolds, wrote and sang songs that fit her socialist thinking and her libertarian spirit, as well as her critique of the modern commercial culture. everybody now, she sang, lived in ""little boxes"" and they ""all came out just the same.""  bob dylan was a phenomenon unto himself: powerful songs of protest, persona] songs of freedom and self-expression. in an angry song, ""masters of war,"" he hopes that one day they will the and he will follow their casket ""in the pale afternoon."" ""a hard rain's a-gonna fall"" recounts the terrible stories of the last decades, of starvation and war, and tears, and dead ponies, and poisoned waters, and damp, dirty prisons-""it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall."" dylan sang a bitter antiwar song, ""with god on our side,"" and one about the killer of the black activist medgar evers, ""only a pawn in their game."" he offered a challenge to the old, hope to the new, for ""the times they are a- changin'.""  the catholic upsurge against the war was part of a general revolt inside the catholic church, which had for so long been a bulwark of conservatism, tied to racism, jingoism, war. priests and nuns resigned from the church, opened their lives to sex, got married and had children-sometimes without bothering to leave the church officially. true, there was still enormous popularity for the old-time religious revivalists, and billy graham commanded the obedience of millions, but now there were small swift currents against the mainstream.  there was a new suspicion of big business, of profiteering as the motive for ruining the environment. there was a reexamination of the ""death industry,"" of moneymaking funerals and profitable tombstones, as in jessica mitford's the american way of death.  with the loss of faith in big powers-business, government, religion-there arose a stronger belief in self, whether individual or collective. the experts in all fields were now looked at skeptically: the belief grew that people could figure out for themselves what to eat, how to live their lives, how to be healthy. there was suspicion of the medical industry and campaigns against chemical preservatives, valueless foods, advertising. by now the scientific evidence of the evils of smoking- cancer, heart disease-was so powerful that the government barred advertising of cigarettes on television and in newspapers.  traditional education began to be reexamined. the schools had taught whole generations the values of patriotism, of obeying authority, and had perpetuated ignorance, even contempt for people of other nations, races, native americans, women. not just the content of education was challenged, but the style-the formality, the bureaucracy, the insistence on subordination to authority. this made only a small dent in the formidable national system of orthodox education, but it was reflected in a new generation of teachers all over the country, and a new literature to sustain them: jonathan kozol, death at an early age; george denison, the lives of children; ivan illich, de-schooling society.  never in american history had more movements for change been concentrated in so short a span of years. but the system in the course of two centuries had learned a good deal about the control of people. in the mid-seventies, it went to work.embed"

(mary driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. she has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)  second watch another! are you of the unfortunate class?  mary driscoll (indignantly.) i'm not a bad one. i bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. i was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with fridays out, and i had to leave owing to his carryings on.  first watch what do you tax him with?  mary driscoll he made a certain suggestion but i thought more of myself as poor as i am.  bloom (in housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) i treated you white. i gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. incautiously i took your part when you were accused of pilfering. there's a medium in all things. play cricket.  mary driscoll (excitedly.) as god is looking down on me this night if ever i laid a hand to them oysters!  first watch the offence complained of? did something happen?  mary driscoll he surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. he held me and i was discoloured in four places as a result. and he interfered twice with my clothing.  bloom she counterassaulted.  mary driscoll (scornfully.) i had more respect for the scouringbrush, so i had. i remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: keep it quiet!  (general laughter.)  georges fottrell (clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) order in court! the accused will now make a bogus statement.  (bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. they would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. he was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. a seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. there might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. an acclimatised britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent british born bairns lisping prayers to the sacred infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )  (renewed laughter. he mumbles incoherently. reporters complain that they cannot hear.)  longhand and shorthand (without looking up from their notebooks.) loosen his boots.  professor machugh (from the presstable, coughs and calls.) cough it up, man. get it out in bits.

(uproar and catcalls. bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)  j. j. o'molloy (in barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) this is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. we are not in a beargarden nor at an oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. my client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. the trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the pharaoh. prima facie, i put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. i would deal inespecial with atavism. there have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. if the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. he himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. his submission is that he is of mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. not all there, in fact.  bloom (barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) him makee velly muchee fine night. (he begins to lilt simply.)  li li poo lil chile, blingee pigfoot evly night. payee two shilly...   (he is howled down.)  j. j. o'molloy (hotly to the populace.) this is a lonehand fight. by hades, i will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. the mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. i say it and i say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. the young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (bloom takes j. j. o'molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) i shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. when in doubt persecute bloom. my client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. he wants to go straight. i regard him as the whitest man i know. he is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at agendath netaim in faraway asia minor, slides of which will now be shown. (to bloom.) i suggest that you will do the handsome thing.  bloom a penny in the pound.

(he assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of seymour bushe.) when the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live i say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt.

(carelessly.) i was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir robert and lady ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. sir bob, i said...  mrs yelverton barry (in lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) arrest him constable. he wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the north riding of tipperary on the munster circuit, signed james lovebirch. he said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as i sat in a box of the theatre royal at a command performance of la cigale. i deeply inflamed him, he said. he made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following thursday, dunsink time. he offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by monsieur paul de kock, entitled the girl with the three pairs of stays.  mrs bellingham (in cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) also to me. yes, i believe it is the same objectionable person. because he closed my carriage door outside sir thornley stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of february ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. i had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.  mrs yelverton barry shame on him!  (a crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)  the sluts and ragamuffins (screaming.) stop thief! hurrah there, bluebeard! three cheers for ikey mo!  second watch (produces handcuffs.) here are the darbies.  mrs bellingham he addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. he lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. he urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.  the honourable mrs mervyn talboys (in amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) also me. because he saw me on the polo ground of the phoenix park at the match all ireland versus the rest of ireland. my eyes, i know, shone divinely as i watched captain slogger dennehy of the inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob centaur. this plebeian don juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. i have it still. it represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. he urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. he implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.  mrs bellingham me too.  mrs yelverton barry me too.  (several highly respectable dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from bloom.)  the honourable mrs mervyn talboys (stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) i will, by the god above me. i'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as i can stand over him. i'll flay him alive.  bloom (his eyes closing, quails expectantly.) here?

(kitty ricketts bends her head. her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. she snakes her neck, nestling. stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)  stephen as a matter of fact it is of no importance whether benedetto marcello found it or made it. the rite is the poet's rest. it may be an old hymn to demeter or also illustrate coela enarrant gloriam domini. it is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round david's that is circe's or what am i saying ceres' altar and david's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. jetez la gourme. faut que jeunesse se passe.
