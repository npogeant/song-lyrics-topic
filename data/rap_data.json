1]\nHailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad\nWhen I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had\nI can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you

Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it\nWe're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you\nDaddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news\nI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'\nTogether ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then, of course, everything always happens for a reason\nI guess it was never meant to be\nBut it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream\nYou might also like[Chorus 1]\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe feel how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\n\n[Verse 2]\nHeh, it's funny\nI remember back one year when Daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree\nAnd said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying\n'Cause Daddy felt like a bum\u2014see, Daddy had a job\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom\nAnd at the time, every house that we lived in\nEither kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block\nAnd your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar\nTryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\nMom and Dad was arguin' a lot\nSo Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment\nAnd Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when Daddy went to California with his CD\nAnd met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me\nBut Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me\nThen you started seein' Daddy on the TV\nAnd Mama didn't like it\nAnd you and Lainie were too young to understand it\nPapa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'\nLookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\nWow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here\nLainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?\nShh! Mama's only gone for the moment\n[Chorus 1]\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe feel how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'ma give you the world\nI'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'ma break that birdie's neck\nI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

some of you\nWhatever weather, cold or warm\nMight still be in that place\nJust lettin' you know that you're not alone\nIf you're tryna get out\nHolla if you feel like you've been down the same road\nJust follow me, I'll get you there\n[Verse 1]\nYou can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em\nBut you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em\n'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem\nWhen I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think\nI'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world\nFeed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me\nI'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly\nAnd all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony\nNo ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he\nFrom Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's\nStill shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly\nUntil he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him\nWhichever comes first, for better or worse\nHe's married to the game\nLike a \"fuck you\" for Christmas, his gift is a curse\nForget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt\nAnd fuck the whole

scissors and shit, and cut the crap\nI shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap\nYou said you was king, you lied through your teeth\nFor that, fuck your feelings\nInstead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped\nAnd to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back\nI promise to never go back on that promise\nIn fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was \"ehh\"\nPerhaps I ran them accents into the ground\nRelax, I ain't goin' back to that now\nAll I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!\n'Cause I ain't playin' around\nThere's a game called circle and I don't know how\nI'm way too up to back down\nBut I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out\nThought I had it mapped out\nBut I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around\nBut it's time to exorcise these demons\nThese ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)\nTo take a stand (To take a stand)\nEverybody

like you've been down the same road\n[Bridge]\nAnd I just can't keep livin' this way\nSo startin' today\nI'm breakin' out of this cage\nI'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons\nI'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground\nI've had enough, now I'm so fed up\nTime to put my life back together right now\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt was my decision to get clean, I did it for me\nAdmittedly I probably did it subliminally for you\nSo I could come back a brand-new me\nYou helped see me through\nAnd don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you\nI've been through the wringer\nBut they can do little to the middle finger\nI think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of\nMy world, haters can make like bees with no stingers\nAnd drop dead: no more beef lingers\nNo more drama from now on, I promise\nTo focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father\nSo I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it\nYou couldn't lift a single shingle on it\n'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club\nOr the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up\n'Cause I'm raisin' the bar\nI'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars\nI feel amazin', and

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

grad'\nSleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad\nReality struck, I seen the white car crash\nHit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed\nMy pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him\nSecurity guard for a month and ended up leavin'\nIn fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends\nTo stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in\nProjects tore up, gang signs get thrown up\nCocaine laced in marijuana\nAnd they wonder why I rarely smoke now\nImagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth\nI was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even\nI made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'\nYou know the reasons but still'll never know my life\nKendrick a.k.a. \"Compton's Human Sacrifice\"\n[Interlude: MC

some Now and Laters to eat?\nIf I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?\nWould you say my intelligence now is great relief?\nAnd it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep\nWith dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor\nInstead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage\nKill 'em all if they gossip\nThe Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option\nOf livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins\nConstantly drinkin' and drive\nHit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye\nListen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it

LyricsTo honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever\n\nRap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

abusing my power so you can hurt\nAbout me and her in the shower whenever she horny\nAbout me and her in the after hours of the morning\nAbout her baby daddy currently serving life\nAnd how she think about you until we meet up at night\nAbout the only girl that cared about you when you asked her\nAnd how she fuckin' on a famous rapper\nWalls can talk (Talk)\n\n[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]\nI remember

Every photo upload or click of a \u201clike\u201d button deposits users' personal data online, much of which is sold to help businesses target advertising. To some, such data mining endangers long-cherished privacy rights, but social media supporters say it is a small price to pay for the benefits of online socializing. Meanwhile, critics of social media express concern that many members of the digital generation may fail to develop vital communication skills because they prefer virtual contact over face-to-face conversations. But proponents say most people use social media not to avoid others but to stay in touch with them.\n\nGo to top\n\nOverview\n\nRandi Zuckerberg \u2014 Facebook's former marketing director and sister of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 should have known better.\n\nAfter she posted a family photo for her Facebook friends, the picture popped up in the Twitter feed of someone not on Ms. Zuckerberg's \u201cfriend\u201d list. \u201cNot sure where you got this photo,\u201d she tweeted angrily. \u201cI posted it only to friends. You reposting it on Twitter is way uncool.\u201d\n\nBut the error was Zuckerberg's. Even though she had guided Facebook's marketing, she hadn't remembered one of the company's complex rules for figuring out which postings are private. The person who tweeted the picture was a Facebook friend of a different Zuckerberg sister in the photo. Because that sister was named \u2014 \u201ctagged,\u201d in Facebook parlance \u2014 as one of the photo's subjects, the picture was visible to all her Facebook friends as well, despite sister Randi's intention to only share it privately.\nIt's a typical confusion of the social media era, when mushrooming numbers of photos and other personal information are being placed online with no consensus about whether any of it should remain private or viewable by only a few, and, if so, how to accomplish that.\n\nThe Internet has been a haven for socializing since its earliest days, but beginning about a decade ago technology developers have focused like a laser on \u201csocial media\u201d \u2014 software designed primarily to facilitate social interaction \u2014 as the key to drawing the public online. Today, social media include social networks such as Facebook that allow people to reach out to friends of friends; the photo-sharing site Pinterest; the collaboratively written Wikipedia encyclopedia; the \u201cuser review\u201d sections at retail websites such as Amazon; \u201cvirtual worlds\u201d such as \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d where people from around the world meet, compete, collaborate and play adventure games together, and many more.\n\n\n\n\nLinebacker Manti Te'o of the University of Notre Dame is at the center of an Internet hoax involving his two-year online relationship with a non-existent young woman who Te'o said had died of cancer. The situation constitutes \u201ca terrible statement about where we are today and how social media is a tool in some really bad stuff,\u201d said Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick.

As of July 2011, nearly 164 million Americans were using social media, according to the New York City-based media-research company Nielsen, and by July 2012 the number had risen 5 percent, to about 172 million.\n\nWhile research is in its earliest stages, some analysts believe that because young people, especially, have shifted so much social energy online, social media may end up having profound effects not just on privacy but on both individual human relationships and how people relate to their communities.\n\nFacebook CEO Zuckerberg has famously said that, because of social networks, privacy is no longer a \u201csocial norm.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people,\u201d said Zuckerberg. That new social norm is \u201cjust something that has evolved over time,\u201d he said.\n\nBut some analysts argue that privacy protections are crucial. \u201cThe No. 1 problem is that the United States doesn't have data-protection\u201d requirements, says Alice Marwick, an assistant professor in communication and media studies at Fordham University in New York City. \u201cThe No. 2 problem,\u201d she says, \u201cis that the market impulse goes in the opposite direction\u201d from privacy protection, promising huge financial rewards to social media companies that sell users' information for targeted marketing efforts and the like.\n\nLittle is known about how social media may be affecting human relationships. However, some analysts fear that social media are being seen as a replacement for face-to-face conversation. In a survey on favored communication modes, people born between 1990 and 1999 said they prefer texting above all other forms of communication, but in second place \u2014 tied with instant messaging and phone calls \u2014 is communicating via Facebook. Strikingly, face-to-face conversation is the least favored form of communication for the digital generation. That's a stark reversal of the survey preferences voiced by each generational cohort born between 1946 and 1989. All those groups put face-to-face conversation as their preferred conversational mode, and none even listed a social media technology.\n\n\u201cMany kids say they prefer not to talk face to face,\u201d notes Larry Rosen, a professor of psychology at California State University, Dominguez Hills. Instead, he says, they rely on written communication only, mainly via text or social media sites, especially when communicating with adults. That choice might damage young people's communication skills for years to come, Rosen says. When people rely entirely on written messages \u201cwhere you don't have access to [nonverbal] cues, things are ripe for miscommunication,\u201d he says. Furthermore, without enough practice observing how people communicate through tone and gesture, it becomes difficult to accurately read face-to-face conversations that do take place, he says.\n\nSome worry that a preference for social media over face-to-face meetings may make it easier and more tempting to commit identity fraud and hoaxes. For example, although exactly who was involved in the elaborate hoax is not yet clear, it was recently revealed that star Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o engaged in a two-year online relationship with a non-existent young woman who Te'o said died of cancer. He says he did not know it was a hoax. The situation constitutes \u201ca terrible statement about where we are today and how social media is a tool in some really bad stuff,\u201d said Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick.\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers see little reason for worry. Most \u201cdigital natives\u201d \u2014 the generation that has grown up online \u2014 do not appear to be living their personal lives much differently than older generations, says Kaveri Subrahmanyam, a professor of psychology at California State University, Los Angeles. Most use social media mainly \u201cto connect to people already in their lives\u201d and \u201cdo the things they'd do anyway\u201d in the physical world, she says. \u201cSocially, I don't think that we need to be too concerned,\u201d at least about the average person.\n\nThe Internet's potential to ignite a more civically engaged populace by making policy information and political debate easily accessible has excited speculation since the world first went online. Now, the dominance of social media \u2014 which spark intense online engagement by many people in social and entertainment matters, for example \u2014 has further fueled those hopes.\n\nResearch suggests that social media are leading to increased political activity, says Joseph Kahne, a professor of education at Mills College, in Oakland, Calif., and chairman of the MacArthur Foundation's Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics. In a survey, 41 percent of young people reported engaging in what Kahne terms \u201cparticipatory politics\u201d \u2014 individual efforts to influence public policy outside the sphere of institutions such as political parties. Their methods include tweeting support for a cause or forwarding a news article about an issue. This kind of personal political engagement is \u201chappening more and more\u201d among young people of all races and ethnicities, he says.\n\nAn example occurred in January 2012, when the Dallas-based Susan G. Komen Foundation, which supports breast cancer research and treatment, announced it would no longer fund programs offered by Planned Parenthood, Kahne notes. The announcement triggered a storm of furious commentary on Twitter, Facebook and other online sites \u2014 some from individuals and some from organizations \u2014 and three days later the foundation reversed course.\n\nParticipatory politics played a big role in the incident, in which a powerful organization was prodded to change its position, at least partly because of influence from everyday people, says Kahne. The influence \u201cdidn't generally run through institutions\u201d such as lobbyists or lawmakers, he says. Instead, \u201ca lot of people posted stuff on Facebook pages. It went viral.\u201d\n\nDespite the growing prevalence of such events, social media probably are not causing more people to become interested in politics and policy, as some Internet analysts have long hoped, Kahne says. Most people who engage in the new participatory politics would have been following politics anyway, he says. However, social media have provided new ways for people to turn their interest into deeper involvement and influence, he says.\n\nAs Internet users and technology analysts ponder how the burgeoning world of social media may be changing people's lives, here are some of the questions being asked:\n\nDo social media foster greater community engagement?\n\nThrough social media such as Twitter and Facebook, friends can urge friends to become involved in causes, and advocacy groups can reach out to millions. Social-media skeptics, however, wonder how much of this new engagement is useful.\n\nDuring riots in London in August 2011, triggered by economic unrest and a police shooting, \u201cwe have seen extraordinary acts of pro-active social engagement\u201d carried out on social media, wrote Kate Crawford, a principal researcher at the corporate think tank Microsoft Research, in Boston, and an associate professor of media at Australia's University of New South Wales, in Sydney. A Facebook and Twitter campaign under the hashtag #riotcleanup \u201crallied people to clean up the streets,\u201d wrote Crawford. On Twitter and Tumblr \u2014 a social network and blog website that makes it easy for users to follow other users' blogs \u2014 citizen journalists writing from the field \u201cmade substantive contributions to media coverage,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media make supporting and organizing causes easier than in the past and are especially effective in getting people already interested in politics to take a more active role, says Daniel Kreiss, an assistant professor of journalism and mass communication at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. For example, thanks to social media, \u201cI can give a small donation much easier \u2014 instantaneously\u201d in fact, he says. Debating public issues can now be done from home, for free, via social media channels such as Twitter, Tumblr blogs, and newspaper and blog comment sections. In the past, self-publishing a pamphlet cost at least a bit of cash, and figuring out how to get it to potentially interested people was extremely difficult, Kreiss notes.\n\nPresident Obama's 2008 and 2012 campaign operations used Facebook effectively to encourage supporters to contact particular Facebook \u201cfriends\u201d who analysts determined were promising targets for a vote-Obama pitch, Kreiss says.\n\n\u201cA strong activist community is one that is unified and [has] a sense of camaraderie,\u201d wrote Charles Harris, a political science major and 2011 graduate of Western Kentucky University Honors College, in Bowling Green, who organized his local university chapter of a national peace and sustainability group. Facebook is an ideal place to bring activists together because the frequent interaction people experience on social media can increase \u201ccomfort levels in interaction during regular meetings\u201d in real life, he said.\n\nSome observers argue, however, that the role of big-name social media such as Twitter has been overblown when it comes to organizing protests.\n\nWestern commentators have claimed that Iranians used Twitter to organize protests after a contested June 2009 election. But, in fact, Twitter was used only minimally, according to Golnaz Esfandiari, an Iranian-born blogger and a senior correspondent for the U.S.-funded agency Radio Free Europe, which broadcasts to Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East. Most of the Twitter feeds Westerners quoted as evidence of Twitter's role were in English, and \u201cno one seemed to wonder why people trying to coordinate protests in Iran would be writing in any language other than Farsi,\u201d Esfandiari said. Twitter may actually have had a destructive influence on the protests because it eased the spread of unsubstantiated rumors, she said.\n\nIn social media's early days, Internet theorists \u201chad this amazing optimism that as the cost of [becoming engaged and engaging others] falls, then everyone was going to be engaged in public issues,\u201d says Kreiss. \u201cBut it turns out that there's always a ceiling, in money, in skills, in time.\u201d It's now clear that while many who were already interested in public issues are more deeply engaged because of social media, the greatly broadened participation once predicted is highly unlikely to happen, he says.\n\nWith ever-increasing amounts of information about individuals available from social networks such as Facebook, political campaigns can target their messages to only the very small slice of the electorate prone to be persuadable, and that could be dangerous to democracy, wrote Kreiss and Philip N. Howard, an associate professor of communication at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cScholars have long feared a \u2018democratic deficit\u2019\u201d when campaigns communicate only with the handful of voters they believe will respond to specific pitches so that successful candidates, in effect, end up representing only those people, they wrote.\n\nSocial media communications and relationships are too short and shallow to spur deep commitment, argues best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell, a journalist who writes about social-science research.\n\nEffective activists for high-stakes causes such as the 1960s civil rights marches almost invariably have a high degree of personal connection to the movement, with many real-life friends \u2014 the kind \u201cwho talk late into the night with one another\u201d \u2014 also involved, he wrote. \u201cThe kind of activism associated with social media isn't like this at all,\u201d Gladwell argues. Twitter \u201cis a way of following \u2026 people you may never have met,\u201d while Facebook is \u201cfor keeping up with the people you would not otherwise be able to stay in touch with.\u201d Such acquaintances are useful for passing along new information about causes one might consider supporting, but they aren't personally compelling enough to inspire the hard work of true activism, he argues.\n\nAre social media making personal relationships more difficult?\n\nWith many people communicating with friends more online than off these days, debate is growing about whether that trend is healthy for human relationships.\n\n\u201cIt's a tough area to study because it's all so new,\u201d says California State's Rosen. \u201cThere are no answers yet.\u201d\n\nSome trends are emerging, however, Rosen and other researchers say.\n\nTeens are showing \u201ca decrease in risk taking\u201d from previous generations when it comes to expressing themselves and interacting with other people, says Katie E. Davis, an assistant professor at the University of Washington Information School in Seattle. \u201cIt's hard to know how much of this comes from technology,\u201d but many teenagers today hold back on intimacy by forgoing face-to-face conversations whenever possible in favor of writing on a Facebook wall or texting \u2014 modes of communication that encourage much briefer and less open-ended dialogue than do more traditional approaches such as face-to-face talk or even email, she says.\n\n\u201cIt feels much safer to broach uncomfortable subjects when you don't have to look someone in the eye,\u201d says Davis. \u201cIt takes a lot of the messiness out of relationships, but it means that you don't make yourself vulnerable,\u201d Davis says. That can be a problem because vulnerability is a key to strong relationships, she says.\n\nMany teens also seem constrained when it comes to expressing different aspects of themselves freely, Davis says. Traditionally, \u201cadolescence is a time of experimentation,\u201d when people try on many roles and are concerned with self-expression, she points out. But, she adds, in a Facebook-dominated world many say \u201cthat how they present themselves online is very public, something that friends\u201d and even parents and college admissions officers might scrutinize and judge, she says. Then, because the online and offline social worlds are increasingly intertwined, many teens end up presenting themselves in both arenas as what Davis terms \u201cpackaged, polished selves\u201d who conform to whatever image they believe fits best in their social circle, without allowing eccentric pictures or negative emotions or unusual interests to show. \u201cEverything's happy on Facebook\u201d even if it's not, she says.\n\nAs the online world migrates to mobile devices through which social media are readily available 24 hours a day, new concerns arise.\n\nA 2011 study found that smartphone users are developing \u201cchecking habits\u201d \u2014 recurring 30-second glances at social media such as Facebook \u2014 as often as every 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cJust the fact that we're constantly pulling our phones out\u201d is evidence \u201cthat we're becoming anxious,\u201d says Rosen. \u201cAn obsession is something that builds up an anxiety so that we have to do something about it to relieve it\u201d \u2014 in this case, check for contact from one's social group, he says.\n\nCamp directors interviewed by the University of Washington's Davis see this anxiety growing rampant among \u201chelicopter parents,\u201d Davis says. To avoid being out of touch with their away-at-camp children, some parents now equip their youngster with two cell phones so that when the camp director asks for one to be handed over, the child still has a hidden one. \u201cParents expect to see pictures of their children on a camp's website\u201d daily, something unheard of just a few years ago, Davis says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDigital natives\u201d are \u201calways connected, never alone,\u201d says Subrahmanyam, at California State University, Los Angeles.\n\nThis fact may translate into overblown fears of being alone, according to some analysts. \u201cWe have a generation of young adults who, due to no fault of their own, have grown dependent on continuous technological connection,\u201d wrote Vivian Diller, a psychologist in New York City. With so little experience dealing with \u201cfrustration or loneliness,\u201d Diller wonders how a cell phone-dependent generation will deal with such feelings.\n\nThe more one's Facebook friends include people from different spheres \u2014 such as extended family, school friends and work colleagues \u2014 the greater one's social stress, according to researchers at Scotland's University of Edinburgh. \u201cFacebook used to be like a great party for all your friends where you can dance, drink and flirt,\u201d said Ben Marder, a fellow at the university's business school. \u201cNow with your mum, dad and boss there, the party becomes an anxious event full of potential social landmines.\u201d\n\nBut many researchers also note that qualms and difficulties always accompany new technology and that some evidence indicates that much social media use is benign.\n\nIn young people's quick embrace of social media, it's clear that they constitute \u201ca primal way to satisfy the eternal need for social connection,\u201d says Subrahmanyam.\n\nSocial media tools clearly help some people, says Rosen. For example, studies show that for people with mild or major depression, \u201chaving many friends on Facebook helps\u201d improve moods, in the same way that talking on the phone does.\n\nIn addition, \u201cwe've actually found that practicing being empathetic online\u201d \u2014 such as by commenting positively on someone's online postings \u2014 \u201ccan help you learn to be empathetic in the real world,\u201d says Rosen. \u201cNow we're looking at whether kids can learn other social skills online,\u201d such as taking turns and \u201cexpressing what you say in nicer terms,\u201d and then translate those skills into offline situations where they're needed.\n\nAre social media eroding privacy?\n\nAs people navigate the Internet, social media and data-analysis companies gather information about everything from what magazine articles they read to what times of day they log on to websites and whose birthday parties they attend. Statistical analysts aggregate that information into profiles that businesses use to target ads and political campaigns milk for insight into whether voters are persuadable.\n\nTo some, this aspect of social media spells the end of the very notion of privacy \u2014 the idea that all people have the right and should have the ability to determine for themselves who can see their personal information. But others say allowing such \u201cdata mining\u201d for commercial and other purposes is a reasonable price to pay for the services social media provide.\n\nInternet users are likely unaware of how aggressive companies are about using personal information, wrote software developer Dave Winer, who says the current climate \u201cscares\u201d him.\n\n\u201cI have always assumed everything I post to Facebook is public,\u201d but companies now use information that we leave behind simply by visiting websites, without ever clicking a \u201cLike\u201d button or posting a comment, Winer wrote. \u201cWhat clued me in was an article on [the technology blog] ReadWriteWeb that says that just reading an article on their site may create an announcement on Facebook\u201d that will go out to all of one's Facebook followers \u2014 a group that includes not just one's Facebook \u201cfriends\u201d but people, including strangers, who have signed up to get access to public posts. \u201cPeople joke that privacy is over, but I don't think they imagined that the disclosures would be so proactive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the archives of personal data grow, interest increases in examining them for many purposes.\n\nIn the past, college admissions officers viewed only information provided by applicants or available from public sources, such as schools or government agencies. A recent survey of medical school and residency admissions officers, however, found that while only 9 percent said they routinely used material from social networks to make admissions decisions, 53 percent said evidence of unprofessional behavior found on such sites could jeopardize a candidate's spot.\n\nThe Obama campaign had access to more than 500 points of data for every member of the public, including data from surveys, commercial and financial transactions, magazine subscriptions and so on, says Kreiss of the University of North Carolina. \u201cNone of it is very meaningful\u201d on its own, he says. However, because analysts have data for literally hundreds of millions of people, they can use statistical patterns to construct a profile of the person most likely to be swayed to vote for a candidate, he says.\n\nKreiss believes campaigns should be required to reveal basic information about how they use personal data. \u201cWe don't know if the data is secure or how campaigns target certain people\u201d to receive particular individualized ads, he says.\n\nFor example, today campaigns send certain ads to people who access the Internet over a smartphone, different ads to people who use a computer or tablet and very negative ads only to carefully chosen voters. Since the Supreme Court has ruled that it is constitutional to require transparency of political advertisers, \u201cthere should be a disclosure on every individually targeted ad that explains: \u2018Why am I seeing this ad?\u2019\u201d he argues.\n\nNevertheless, Kreiss doesn't think the data give campaigns a creepy superpower to manipulate voters. \u201cAn ad that's specifically targeted to me still won't make me turn into a Republican. Ads work on the margin,\u201d convincing only a very narrow subset of people who are ripe for changing their minds, he says.\n\nThe difficulty of drawing truly accurate conclusions about people from even the largest amounts of data may be the biggest problem, said Alessandro Acquisiti, an associate professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College.\n\nCompanies sell data-mining and profile-assembly services to employers looking for guidance on which job candidates to hire and advertisers seeking to woo customers who might be particularly influential among their peers. Today, some organizations even use facial-recognition software to link people in photos to their Facebook profiles to ferret out more details about them. But analogous experiments carried out by his research team demonstrate that such operations should be regarded with mistrust because it's far too easy to jump to a sure-feeling \u2014 but dead wrong \u2014 conclusion about someone based on information they reveal online, Acquisiti said. \u201cWe tend to make strong extrapolations about weak data,\u201d he said.\n\nOther analysts argue that privacy violations are not a problem, even in some of the most massive databases.\n\nBusinesses that use social media information to target advertising collect the data and target the ads using numerical customer codes rather than real names, according to companies involved in such work. Contrary to privacy-advocates' fears, therefore, the data collection actually preserves social media users' anonymity and thus their privacy, company representatives say.\n\n\n\n\nCompetitors in the final round of the LG U.S. National Texting Championship face off in New York's Times Square on Aug. 8, 2012.

(AFP/Getty Images/Stan Honda)\n\n\nAn oft-expressed worry is that the \u201cdigital-native\u201d generation may forgo traditional concerns about privacy in favor of broadcasting their doings to a social media audience. In fact, however, many young people \u201care actually being very strategic\u201d and increasingly savvy about social media use, says Fordham University's Marwick.\n\nFor example, \u201cwe see people using sites like Twitter\u201d \u2014 where pseudonyms are allowed \u2014 \u201cto post more playfully\u201d than they would on Facebook, knowing that what they post there is \u201cnot going to come back to their Facebook identities,\u201d Marwick says.\n\nTeens also are shifting to pseudonym-permitted sites to share the kind of private revelations that most people have always restricted to a small circle, according to the blog of mobileYouth, a consulting firm that analyzes marketing for mobile devices.\n\nRecent surveys reveal that more teens now seek out social media sites where they can restrict their postings to friends only. At the same time, many are adding to their social media repertoire Twitter accounts blocked to public viewing. A Twitter account visible to friends only is \u201cthe equivalent of having that secret diary you would allow only your closest friends to read. This is where teens post more emotional content \u2014 how they feel after a breakup, their latest crush,\u201d said the mobileYouth analyst.\n\nOne survey found that between 2009 and 2011 teen Twitter users doubled from 8 percent to 16 percent, mainly splitting their online time between Facebook and Twitter, according to the mobileYouth blog.\n\nSome governments are limiting how far companies can go in collecting personal information, although the trend hasn't spread to the United States, says Marwick. The European Union recently required social media sites to turn off their facial-recognition technology. \u201cIt's ridiculous that video store rental is protected and online information\u201d \u2014 much of it far more revealing \u2014 \u201cis not,\u201d she says.\n\nGo to top\n\nBackground\n\nSocial Life\n\nOver the centuries, people have quickly turned new technologies of all kinds into new and improved ways to meet one of humanity's strongest needs \u2014 to socialize. Horse-drawn carriages and automobiles, designed as simple transportation, quickly became dating venues for young lovers. The telephone, intended as a business aid, almost immediately became a favorite means of social chitchat.\n\nIn the late 1960s, when the Internet was established, its quick adoption for friendly social interaction surprised its developers. By 1973, e-mail \u2014 much of it purely social in nature \u2014 made up 75 percent of traffic on ARPANET, the world's first computer network, designed by the Department of Defense to allow researchers to exchange data and access remote computing capability. Early \u201cnewsgroups,\u201d used by Internet researchers to transmit messages, soon included groups sharing their enthusiasms for subjects such as science fiction and wines.\n\nBy the 1990s, technology developers had caught on to the appeal of online socializing and saw it \u2014 rather than the lure of interesting content \u2014 as key to attracting the public online.\n\n\u201cCommunity is the Velcro that keeps people [at America Online (AOL)],\u201d said Ted Leonsis, a former top AOL executive. AOL was one of the first tech companies to provide public access to the Internet from home computers.\n\nAmong the social features AOL introduced early in its existence were chat rooms that allow users to exchange messages live and \u201cbuddy lists\u201d that alert members when their friends are online so they can exchange instant messages.\n\nSocial Media\n\nThe first social networking site (SNS) similar to those that are popular today \u2014 New York-based SixDegrees.com \u2014 was launched in 1997. It integrated several existing software features into a package that closely resembles the later SNS giants, MySpace and Facebook.\n\nSocial network sites are unique not because they \u201callow individuals to meet strangers\u201d with common interests, wrote Nicole Ellison, an associate professor of human-computer interaction at the University of Michigan's School of Information, and Danah Boyd, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research. Online chat rooms and newsgroups always facilitated such interactions, they noted. Instead, social networking sites \u201cenable users to articulate and make visible\u201d to themselves and others their real-world webs of social connections, including friends of friends, thus linking an online social world with a real-life social world, Ellison and Boyd wrote.\n\nUnlike previous online technologies, SNSs alerted people to the \u201cfriends of their friends\u201d and allowed users to browse SNSs' membership lists, thus allowing them to reach out socially by the natural-feeling method of contacting people with whom they have mutual acquaintances, wrote Boyd and Ellison.\n\nOthers can use the information, too, however, setting up concerns about whether this innovative socializing tool exposes SNS members to too much snooping. Among other risks, governments can use the \u201cfriends of friends\u201d information to find and watch the social circles of people they suspect of dangerous activity.\n\nSince the first SNSs came on the scene, the online world has included ever more elements of \u201csocial media\u201d \u2014 loosely defined as technologies that center the online experience on:\n\u2022\nuser-created content, both individual and collaborative; (such as the user-written Wikipedia),\n\n\u2022\nconversation and other interaction among social-media users, such as \u201cliking\u201d fellow users' postings;\n\n\u2022\nparticipation in online communities with shared interests, and\n\n\u2022\nin some cases, publication of individuals' social circles online.\n\n\nThe technologies that enable such activities are known as Web 2.0, a term first used in 2004 to distinguish the new \u2014 social \u2014 online world from the Web 1.0 paradigm, in which software tools were primarily designed to facilitate publishing content on the World Wide Web, according to Andreas M. Kaplan and Michael Haenlein, professors of marketing at the Paris campus of ESCP Europe, a business school.\n\nThe World Wide Web is the massive Internet-based technology, invented around 1990 by British technology developer Tim Berners-Lee, which allows browsers such as Internet Explorer to use so-called hyperlinks to discover and access the millions of documents and other resources that exist on the Internet's connected computers.\n\nIn the Web 1.0 days, the aim behind most online technology was to make it easier and cheaper for individuals and organizations to publish their work online in a way that would be easy for others to discover as they \u201cclicked\u201d website links. As it became clear that socializing is a more compelling human desire than creation, however, Web 2.0 shifted from helping people publish their own blogs to helping them converse, collaborate, compete, meet, socialize and comment on others' online postings, Kaplan and Haenlein wrote. With Web 2.0, online \u201ccontent and applications are no longer created and published by individuals, but instead are continuously modified by all users in a participatory and collaborative fashion.\u201d That occurs, for example, when multiple blog participants create a massive commentary on a single individual post or when YouTube posters create a massive archive of, say, a musician's live and electronic performances.\n\nIn Web 2.0, the universe of online \u201cuser-generated content\u201d exploded. No longer did a person have to commit to a time-consuming personal blog \u2014 which no one might ever see \u2014 to be an online content creator. Using social media tools, even time-strapped people and those who aren't interested in writing their thoughts have easy routes to posting content that others are likely to see and respond to. Spurred by the lure of getting responses from others, Internet users have embraced social media.\n\nSocial media technologies also include reader-review sections at online retailer Amazon and other commercial sites; increasingly expansive readers'-comment sections on blogs and at newspaper websites; YouTube, where cell phone and other videos are shared by people and businesses; the photo-sharing site Pinterest where people post and categorize favorite images relating to interests such as fashion; and blog websites such as Tumblr, where some bloggers mainly post screen captures and brief animated snippets from favorite TV shows.\n\nIn fact, not all social media even require users to create content to participate and collaborate, notes Christopher Peterson, a research assistant at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Civic Media.\n\nWebsites such as Digg and Reddit, for example, engage members in \u201ccurating\u201d online content, or filtering the staggering amount of content that appears online daily, elevating the best to a position so others will be likely to see it. Users vote posted content up or down, and, based on an algorithm that weights individual users' ratings, content that's judged most positively rises to prominence, says Peterson. As a result, large numbers of ordinary Internet users daily sift through massive amounts of material and \u201cdecide what's good or bad \u2014 rather than having editors decide to what our attention should be directed,\u201d he says. \u201cWe trust the people and the algorithm to surface useful information from a flood of material.\u201d\n\nOther social media offer opportunities to interact through role-playing in \u201cvirtual worlds.\u201d\n\nIn multiplayer online role-playing games such as \u201cWorld of Warcraft,\u201d players choose characters \u2014 called avatars \u2014 to represent themselves and enter a virtual game world to pursue adventures such as fighting monsters or seeking treasure. In the process, they interact with other players' characters, competing, collaborating and forming friendships, rivalries and romances. Players find the social games so compelling that they spend an average 22.7 hours a week in play.\n\nOther virtual social worlds such as \u201cSecond Life\u201d don't have game-style rules but allow people to choose animated avatars and \u201clive\u201d in an online video environment as those people. Players socialize and form relationships with other \u201cresidents\u201d as they explore the world, create and participate in groups of many kinds as well as create businesses and \u201csell\u201d one another virtual goods and services such as virtual pets, clothing, jewelry, works of art and parcels of \u201cSecond Life\u201d real estate.\n\nSocial Everywhere\n\nThe use of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets for accessing the Internet also has helped fuel social media's dominance.\n\nTweets and Facebook status updates encapsulate a moment's thought or emotion, making them perfect for devices that are always in one's pocket, argues Kaplan, the Paris marketing professor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the world has gone mobile, social media have become \u201can even more integrated part of social life\u201d because mobile-device users are actually connected to social media at all times, even when surrounded by live companions, as in a restaurant with friends or family, says Fordham's Marwick. That gives people's social media circles increased influence because \u201cyou're getting feedback\u201d from them constantly, she observes.\n\nSome social media have been developed to take advantage of the fact that mobile devices reveal their users' exact locations 24 hours a day, wrote Kaplan. At the locally based directory services collectively known as Yelp, users can search for local businesses and post reviews of businesses that are then \u201ctagged\u201d to a location and accessible to other users who visit the spot. Yelp users also gain reputations in the Yelp community as useful or less useful reviewers, based on voting by other users.\n\nWho's in Charge?\n\nSocial media facilitate easy communication with friends as well as publication of one's ideas to a potentially wide audience. As of August 2012, nearly 70 percent of U.S. adult Internet users employed social networking sites, for example, including 75 percent of women and 92 percent of people ages 18 to 29. And it's all free.\n\nFree, however, always comes at a price. The bottom line with anything consumers get \u201cfree\u201d is this, wrote a commenter pen-named \u201cblue_beetle\u201d on the MetaFilter blog: \u201cIf you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to social media, the presumed value of the customer-as-product lies in the massive amounts of personal information social media users leave online, which businesses hope to use to target ads and marketing. That includes information people post about themselves, information gleaned from analyzing an individual's social media connections and patterns of online activity and information that mobile technology sends out constantly about its users' geographic location and online activities. Debates over how that information is collected, stored and used and who has the right to grant access to it and control its uses have raged throughout the social media age.\n\n\u201cEven more so than television audience members, Facebook users function as workers who look \u2026 at advertisements but are also, crucially, suppliers of personal information and producers of content \u2014 particularly on a platform like Facebook,\u201d wrote Tamara Shepherd, a postdoctoral fellow in information-technology management at Toronto's Ryerson University. Unlike with traditional media, the customer information social media produces is so detailed that advertisers not only can determine which products people are likely to buy but can use clues about their economic status to show them different prices for the same goods, Shepherd wrote.\n\n\u201cThe privacy concerns surrounding social media are the most important things to pay attention to,\u201d says Fordham's Marwick. \u201cWe want to connect and share with those we care about, and we want to participate in public life, but we don't want our information to be public,\u201d she says.\n\nGo to top\n\nCurrent Situation\n\nProfits and Control\n\nSocial media companies continue looking for ways to turn the public's love of their products into profit, but the process is tough. Meanwhile, struggles continue between marketers hungry for personal data and individuals who want to control how their information is shared.\n\nDuring the recent holiday shopping season, while store and online sales rose, the number of purchases made after a social media user clicked through to a store from a site such as Facebook or YouTube dropped 26 percent from the previous year. Furthermore, old-fashioned email advertising resulted in $39.40 in sales for each dollar spent in 2012, compared to only $12.90 worth of sales per dollar spent on social media-based promotions.\n\nSocial media businesses keep looking for ways to cash in on user-generated content. But users are managing to beat back some initiatives. In December, the photo-sharing site Instagram, owned by Facebook, sparked ire when it announced that it not only claimed full ownership of photos and all other information users leave on the site but would accept cash from companies and other organizations \u201cto display your username, likeness, photos and/or actions you take\u201d in advertising and promotional material \u201cwithout any compensation to you.\u201d For example, Instagram users might find their vacation photos and comments used in advertising for a hotel or resort without getting paid for the content.\n\nAfter commenters on Instagram and other social media sites reacted angrily, the company quickly changed course, however. \u201cInstagram has no intention of selling your photos, and we never did. We don't own your photos, you do,\u201d co-founder and CEO Kevin Systrom backtracked on the company blog.\n\n\n\n\nSeattle resident Damon Brown is all smiles after Facebook helped give him a new lease on life.

In December, Facebook unveiled a revamped system that makes privacy-control tools more easily findable on the site and shows users more details about where and to whom their information is visible \u2014 both consumer-friendly moves. However, in the same package, Facebook ended users' rights to mark their profiles off-limits to Facebook's search function.\n\nThe ability to hide one's profile from search is being \u201cretired\u201d because only a \u201csingle-digit percentage\u201d of Facebook users do so, explained the company's director of product, Sam Lessin. However, because Facebook now has over a billion users, that \u201csingle-digit percentage\u201d could mean \u201ctens of millions\u201d of people, remarked Nick Bilton, a technology blogger for The New York Times.\n\nThis month, Facebook introduced the first version \u2014 fledgling and incomplete \u2014 of a search tool that ultimately will allow users to search for much more than just names. Using Graph Search, users can dig into Facebook's photo archives as well as the many preferences that people in their social networks have expressed online to find, for example, \u201cphotos of friends before 1990\u201d or which Facebook connections are fans of a particular columnist.\n\nIn response, some analysts predict a mass rejection of photo tagging and \u201cliking\u201d as people realize that things they casually responded to five years ago are suddenly searchable by anyone in their Facebook network.\n\nLimiting Access\n\nSimmering questions about whether social media facilitate serious invasions of privacy are leading to new legislative proposals.\n\nLast September in Europe, Facebook turned off its facial-recognition software, which links names to photographed faces based on other photos that users have already \u201ctagged\u201d with a name. Facebook said it would delete all facial-recognition data it had stored for European customers. The Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who oversees data-protection issues for the European Union, and privacy officials in some other EU countries demanded the change on the grounds that the software did not comply with privacy laws in some EU countries.\n\nPrivacy experts worldwide have voiced concerns about whether the technology might allow rampant government surveillance of innocent people as well as potentially invasive or embarrassing commercial-marketing efforts based on the content of photos people consider private.\n\nIn November 2012, in a measure that applies mainly to email, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill requiring the government to get probable-cause warrants to request most stored online communications from companies. And in December the panel approved requiring user consent before an app on a mobile device reports information about its geographic location. Committee leaders are expected to urge further action on the bills this year.\n\nOn Jan. 1, laws took effect in Illinois and California barring employers from asking workers and job seekers for their social media account-access information. California also has a new law barring universities and colleges from seeking applicants' or students' social media passwords.\n\nOn Dec. 28, Michigan's Republican governor, Rick Snyder, signed legislation barring employers and postsecondary educational institutions from requesting social media access information, effective immediately. In early December, New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie signed legislation barring universities and colleges from seeking applicants' or students' passwords. And in November the New Jersey Senate passed a similar ban on employers, which awaits action by the state Assembly. Earlier in 2012, Delaware banned postsecondary educational institutions and Maryland barred employers from seeking social media access information.\n\nFederal legislation blocking employers and colleges from seeking social media access information was introduced in the U.S. House last April, but it expired after no committee acted on it during the 112th Congress.\n\n\u201cOur social media accounts offer views into our personal lives and expose information that would be inappropriate to discuss during a job interview due to the inherent risk of creating biases,\u201d said Democratic California state Assembly member Nora Campos, author of her state's bill.\n\nBut some analysts blame an unfounded \u201cmedia frenzy\u201d for the legislative interest. In March 2012, The Associated Press reported on some isolated incidents in which employers had either requested or required social media log-in information from workers or job applicants. Yet, wrote bloggers for San Francisco-based Littler Mendelson, a law firm specializing in employment issues, no media article has cited \u201ca single study proving that private employers routinely\u201d do so.\n\nMeanwhile, significant cultural changes \u2014 including in how people engage with political issues \u2014 are occurring because of the intertwining of media and social networking, says Kahne of Mills College. \u201cWe think we see potentially a very important shift \u2014 especially for young people\u201d in the way people pass along and learn about the news, he says.\n\nIn a survey by his research group, roughly as many young people said they got news through their Facebook and Twitter relationships with friends and family as said they got it from newspapers, he says. This suggests that a fairly large percentage of young people \u2014 the 10 to 15 percent who report that they regularly forward news \u2014 are \u201cmediating or influencing what their family and friends learn\u201d about the world,\u201d Kahne says. \u201cI would argue that's a significant difference\u201d from the past, with the news-forwarders playing a very active role in shaping the political conversation in their networks, he says.\n\nGo to top\n\nOutlook\n\nChanging Expectations?\n\nJust under a decade into the flowering of social media, early predictions that they would empower people in hitherto unimagined ways and earn billions for social media companies are giving way to more realistic views, analysts say.\n\nTheorists once predicted that, with ever larger numbers of people posting and responding to observations at venues such as Twitter and website comment sections, citizen reporting and analysis might rival if not replace traditional journalism for exposing and opposing official malfeasance, says Kreiss of the University of North Carolina. But that task turns out to be too demanding for unpaid amateurs, no matter how numerous, Kreiss says.\n\n\u201cIt's great to imagine that an army of people on Twitter is going to call the government to account,\u201d but \u201cprofessional journalists are paid to sort through databases\u201d and track down elusive sources \u2014 actions that social-media users, posting for free in their spare time, simply can't do. \u201cProducing high-quality journalism requires resources to counter power, which itself has huge resources,\u201d he says.\n\nMid-2000s expectations for the earnings potential of social media companies were also overblown, says Fordham's Marwick.\n\nThe concept of a \u201csuccessful\u201d social media website is beginning to change, she says. For one thing, sites where users post under pseudonyms \u2014 rather than real names, as Facebook requires \u2014 increasingly get millions of hits by providing social centers where people with shared interests, such as parenting, can converse while maintaining privacy, a combination many people find \u201cvery freeing,\u201d she says. Because these companies don't require people to use their real names or reveal their offline social connections, they'll never collect the masses of individual data that Facebook intends to rely on for ultra-high profits.\n\nStill, Marwick says, \u201cI think a lot of the small companies will be fine because they're not expecting to have billion-dollar IPOs\u201d \u2014 initial public offerings of their shares on Wall Street. \u201cIt's very sexy and exciting to have these young entrepreneurs\u201d such as Facebook CEO Zuckerberg and Microsoft's Bill Gates, who earned billions in the dot-com boom of the 1990s, \u201cbut in reality there's no reason that tech companies should make people millions and millions of dollars. We're moving toward a much more moderate model based on reality,\u201d she says.\n\nHaving social media as today's predominant communications mode is leading to a significant cultural change \u2014 the rise of \u201cparticipatory culture,\u201d which is already baked into the entertainment arena and spilling over into politics, says Kahne of Mills College. Although the change may hardly be noticeable, participatory activities such as public voting to determine the outcome of TV shows, tweeting back and forth with a TV show's writing staff while an episode airs or providing commentary and debate with other fans on a real-time blog during a football game or reality-TV program are now commonplace activities. During the recent presidential campaign both President Obama and GOP candidate Mitt Romney sent special tweets to their followers before debates, bringing people into a closer relationship to the campaigns than in the past, Kahne says.\n\nAll this may make the moment ripe for helping young people forge new connections to political life, Kahne says. The teen and 20-something generation can more easily learn the tools of civic engagement than in the past, because institutions such as advocacy groups and government offices use social media, too, he says.\n\nStudies show that young people already are enthusiastically engaged in participatory culture, and now they can become more politically involved just by \u201cdoing [what] they are already doing\u201d on social media for other interests, such as music and sports, \u201cdrawing on skills they've already developed,\u201d Kahne says. \u201cThese things are much more friendly\u201d to the digital generations than writing letters to the editor, he says.\n\nGo to top\n\nPro/Con\n\nWill social media's use of facial recognition destroy privacy?\n\n\n\n\nPro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlessandro Acquisti\nAssociate Professor of Information Technology, Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. From testimony before Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, July 18, 2012\n\nFace recognition could make our lives easier or more secure; conversely, it could limit our freedom, endanger our security and chill free speech by creating a state of constant and ubiquitous surveillance.\n\nConsider, for instance, Facebook. Many of its users choose photos of themselves as their \u201cprimary profile\u201d image. Facebook has aggressively pursued a \u201creal identity\u201d policy, under which members are expected to join the network under their real names, under penalty of account cancellation. Using tagging features and login security questions, the social network has successfully nudged users to associate their and their friends' names to uploaded photos. These photos are also publicly available: Primary profile photos must be shared with strangers under Facebook's own Privacy Policy.\n\nOnline social networks such as Facebook are accumulating the largest known databases of facial images. Often, those images are tagged or attached to fully identified profiles. Furthermore, many social network users post and tag multiple photos of themselves and their friends, allowing biometric models of their faces, and those of other people as well, to become more accurate. Furthermore, such a vast and centralized biometrics database can be at risk of third-party hacking.\n\nAn analysis of recent history in the market for personal data also suggests that firms may engage in more invasive applications of face recognition over time. If recent history is a guide, the current, almost coy applications of face recognition may be \u201cbridgeheads\u201d designed by firms to habituate end-users into progressively more powerful and intrusive services.\n\nConsider the frequency with which, in the past few years, a popular social network such as Facebook has engaged in practices that either unilaterally modified settings associated with user privacy or reflected a \u201ctwo steps forwards, one step backward\u201d strategy, in which new services were enacted, then taken back due to users' reaction, and then enacted again, after some time had passed.\n\nIn the absence of policy interventions, therefore, the patterns we are observing (increasing gathering and usage of individuals' facial biometrics data) are unlikely to abate.\n\nThe risk exists that some firms may attempt to nudge individuals into accepting more capturing and usage of facial data \u2014 creating a perception of fait accompli which, in turn, will influence individuals' expectations of privacy and anonymity.\n\n\nCon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Sherman\nManager, Privacy & Public Policy, Facebook. From testimony before Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, July 18, 2012\n\nIn the early days of Facebook, we learned how important photo sharing was to our users. One component of our photo management and sharing features is photo tagging \u2014 the 21st century's version of handwriting captions on the backs of photographs \u2014 and it allows users to instantaneously link photos from birthdays, vacations and other important events with the people who participated.\n\nTo help our users more efficiently tag their friends in photos, we built \u201ctag suggestions,\u201d which uses facial recognition technology to suggest people they already know and whom they might want to tag.\n\n\u201cTag suggestions\u201d works by determining what several photos in which a person has been tagged have in common and storing a summary of the data derived from this comparison. When a person uploads a new photo, we compare that photo to the summary information in the templates of the people on Facebook with whom the person communicates frequently. This allows us to make suggestions about whom the user should tag in the photo, which the user can then accept or reject.\n\n\u201cTag suggestions\u201d has been enthusiastically embraced by millions of people because it is convenient, and the uploader is in control of [his or her] photos.\n\nWe launched the feature with several important privacy protections.\n\n\u201cTag suggestions\u201d only uses data people have voluntarily provided to Facebook \u2014 photos and the tags people have applied to them. We do not collect any new information beyond the photos themselves in order for \u201ctag suggestions\u201d to work.\n\nFacebook's technology does not enable people to identify others with whom they have no relationship.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Facebook enables people to prevent the use of their image for facial recognition altogether. Through an easy-to-use privacy setting, people can choose whether they will use our facial recognition technology to suggest that their friends tag them in photos. When you turn off \u201ctag suggestions,\u201d Facebook won't suggest that friends tag you when photos look like you.\n\nOur software cannot be used to compare a photo of an unknown person against our database of user templates. Our technology is designed to search only a limited group of templates \u2014 namely, an individual user's friends \u2014 and law enforcement agencies accordingly cannot use our technology to reliably identify an unknown person.\n\n\nGo to top\n\n\n\n\nChronology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1990s\n\nAs more people go online, companies develop technologies to help them socialize.\n\n\n\n1996\n\nAOL introduces the Buddy List, which alerts users when friends are online.\n\n\n\n1997\n\nThe early social networking site Sixdegrees.com is among the first to link users to friends of their friends.\n\n\n\n2000s\n\nAs the popularity of social networking grows, technology to facilitate user-generated content and social interaction spreads to most websites.\n\n\n\n2001\n\nOnline social network Meetup is launched to help link people wanting to meet offline\u2026.

But the long-term consequences of this behavior are difficult to determine.\n\nSome believe that whatever the psychological and relationship-related changes that may stem from this new form of interaction, social media obsession may already be altering how people think and learn.\n\nSingle-minded focus on a person, object or concept seems to be the first casualty, making the age of online socializing also the age of multitasking, says Larry Rosen, a professor of psychology at California State University, Dominguez Hills.\n\nWhen electronic devices were first becoming ubiquitous, some hoped they would teach a new generation how to multitask better than previous generations did. But research indicates that people who grew up with electronic devices \u201creally can't multitask\u201d either, says Rosen. As a result, the typical technology-obsessed person now gives \u201ccontinuous partial attention\u201d to just about everything and full attention to almost nothing. \u201cYou never do anything in depth,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYou're constantly interrupted, and you're self-interrupting,\u201d too, he says. The very nature of the brain seems to decree that, for many activities, people simply can't do two or more tasks at once. In addition, while the brain can switch rapidly from task to task, doing so takes more time to do the tasks. In addition, he says, \u201cYou simply don't do as thorough a job,\u201d and some tasks simply aren't amenable to being done in a shallow way. The repeated switching of attention also \u201cadds to one's stress.\u201d\n\nSome analysts say evidence may already be showing that technology-driven multitasking takes a toll on one's ability to perform the most complex mental tasks. \u201cI'm not sure I'm able to write in the same concentrated way\u201d as before the saturation of digital media began, says Kaveri Subrahmanyam, a professor of psychology at California State University, Los Angeles. \u201cAnd I'm teaching 20-year-olds who seem to have less memory than I do.\u201d\n\nThe sleep disruptions that accompany social technology may help account for cognitive changes, Subrahmanyam suggests. The \u201cdigital native\u201d generation \u2014 teens and young 20-somethings who have grown up with these technologies \u2014\u201csleep with the cell phone and get up in the middle of the night to respond to texts,\u201d she says. While the long-term effects of such behavior are unknown, research has shown that \u201cfrequent sleep interruptions make it harder for the brain to consolidate the day's learning and memories,\u201d she says.\n\nBecause technologically aided social connection is not going away, society must figure out how to adapt to these changes, says Rosen. He recommends \u201ctech breaks\u201d \u2014 for classrooms and even family dinners \u2014 to help people tolerate the anxiety many feel when unable to check their online social worlds.\n\nBanning cell phones from the classroom or dinner table doesn't work, he says. \u201cIf you take the technology away, you'll lose people in three to five minutes. They'll start to zone out\u201d because of the anxiety of knowing they can't check their phones, he says. Anxious people aren't able to pay attention, he says.\n\nIf, instead, people can check their phones every five minutes, for example, that anxiety is defused, and the intervals between phone-checking time can be increased gradually, he says.\n\nMental focus matters, and social media may pose a particular threat to it, says Rosen.\n\nHis research team conducted detailed observations of 263 middle school, high school and university students while they studied at home for 15 minutes. Not surprisingly, most were surrounded by technology and remained at one task just three to five minutes before losing focus. One finding from the research \u201cstunned\u201d Rosen, though: \u201cIf the students checked Facebook just once during the 15-minute study period, they had a lower grade-point average.\u201d Thanks to always-available social media, Rosen argues, many young people spend their days constantly simmering in anxiety about whether they've heard from online friends, and \u201canxiety inhibits learning.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Marcia Clemmitt\n\n\n\n[1] Larry Rosen, \u201cDriven to Distraction: Our Wired Generation,\u201d Pioneer Press [St. Paul, Minn.], Nov. 12, 2012, www.twincities.com/\u200bopinion/\u200bci_21982260/\u200blarry-rosen-driven-distraction-our-wired-generatio\u200bn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to top\n\nOnline Anonymity Stirs Controversy\nDo real-name-only policies stop abusive behavior or shut down difficult debates?\nAn old joke runs, \u201cOn the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog.\u201d And until several years into the 21st century, that was largely true, since many \u2014 if not most \u2014 people who participated in online discussion forums did so under pseudonyms. That changed, however, when Facebook and other social media sites such as Google Plus and YouTube began requiring users to post under their real names.\n\nSupporters of real-name-only policies say they prevent abusive behavior online because they force people to take full responsibility for what they post. Proponents of allowing pseudonyms, however, say their use frees many people to engage in honest online conversation about delicate topics such as politics, sex or health problems without exposing them to offline suspicion or harassment.\n\n\u201cAnonymity on the Internet has to go away,\u201d said Randi Zuckerberg, former Facebook marketing director and sister of the company's co-founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. \u201cPeople behave a lot better when they have their real names down. People hide behind anonymity, and they feel like they can say whatever they want behind closed doors.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFormer Facebook marketing director Randi Zuckerberg, sister of Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, says people \u201cbehave a lot better\u201d when they use their real names online. (Getty Images/Miguel Villagran)\n\n\nRequiring the use of real names in Internet postings would create a more civil online atmosphere, wrote London-based Internet analyst James Cook. \u201cAssociate someone's real name to abusive content that they've posted online, and suddenly they aren't so keen on standing by it,\u201d said Cook. A requirement for real-name posting \u201cis often accompanied by a rise in quality, and a friendlier community,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you scam someone on eBay if they knew your real name? Would you tell someone to go kill themselves via Twitter if everyone who followed that person knew who you were? The odds are that, no, you would not.\u201d\n\nBut skeptics of the virtue of a real-names-only Web say such arguments ignore salient points. For one thing, posting under a longtime pseudonym, as many veteran Internet posters have done for decades, is different from posting anonymously, says Alice Marwick, an assistant professor in communication and media studies at Fordham University in New York City. Many pseudonymous posters have built up a reputation under their pseudonyms, she says, and preserving that reputation creates many of the same benefits claimed for real-name posting, without opening people to possible harassment because they hold unpopular views.\n\n\u201cThe civility argument doesn't tell the whole story,\u201d said Eva Galperin, international freedom of expression coordinator at the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for online privacy. For instance, \u201cuncivil discourse [is] alive and well in venues with real-name policies (such as Facebook),\u201d she said.\n\nFurthermore, \u201coffline, people say things appropriate to the group they are in,\u201d and the use of online pseudonyms allows people to decide with whom they may openly share which ideas, just as people do in real life, said Bernie Hogan, a research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute in the United Kingdom. Without that, he said, the freedom to share certain thoughts with only some people vanishes.\n\nMany who prefer pseudonymous postings want to preserve the Internet as a venue for honest discussion of difficult topics as much as they want to make it more civil. Among those who may need the protection of pseudonyms to engage in honest discussion are teachers, those whose relatives don't share their views or circumstances, those who live in intolerant communities, spouses of government workers who must keep their political views to themselves and marginalized people, such as homosexuals, wrote Danah Boyd, a senior researcher at the corporate think tank Microsoft Research. \u201cNot everyone is safer by giving out their real name.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople also don't seem to understand the history of Facebook's \u2018real names\u2019 culture,\u201d noted Boyd. \u201cWhen early adopters (elite college students) embraced Facebook, it was a trusted community,\u201d confined to certain universities. Then \u201cas the site grew larger, people had to grapple with new crowds being present and discomfort emerged\u2026. But the norms were set.\u201d\n\nOther analysts say the opportunity to take on another character \u2014 such as by choosing a so-called avatar to represent oneself on a game site or some other kind of virtual world \u2014 can be a valuable learning experience for young people. For safety's sake, many virtual environments created for children and teens bar users from revealing their true names, ages or the cities in which they live, says Deborah Fields, an assistant professor of instructional technology and learning sciences at Utah State University in Logan. The role playing that takes place in virtual environments \u2014 under pseudonyms \u2014 is valuable, and \u201cresearch is suggesting that that's especially true for girls\u201d who, in real life, \u201care often constrained\u201d in their roles. \u201cIt's easier to take on a role with people who don't know you because people who know you put you in a box.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Marcia Clemmitt\n\n\n\n[2] For background, see Gregory Ferenstein, \u201cSurprisingly Good Evidence that Real Name Policies Fail to Improve Comments,\u201d Techcrunch, July 29, 2012, http://techcrunch.com/\u200b2012/\u200b07/\u200b29/\u200bsurprisingly-good-evidence-that-real-namepolicies-\u200bfail-to-improve-comments, and Ramona Emerson, \u201cGoogle+ \u2018Real Names\u2019 Policy Gets Revised,\u201d The Huffington Post, Jan. 24, 2012, www.huffingtonpost.com/\u200b2012/\u200b01/\u200b23/\u200bgoogle-plus-realnames-policy_n_1224970.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[3] Quoted in Eva Galperin, \u201cRandi Zuckerberg Runs in the Wrong Direction on Pseudonymity Online,\u201d Electronic Frontier Foundation, Aug. 2, 2011, www.eff.org/\u200bdeeplinks/\u200b2011/\u200b08/\u200brandi-zuckerberg-runs-wrong-direction-pseudonymity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[4] James Cook, \u201cLet's Have an Internet-wide Real-name Policy,\u201d The Kernel, Jan. 10, 2013, www.kernelmag.com/\u200bcomment/\u200bcolumn/\u200b3951/\u200blets-have-an-internet-wide-real-name-policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[5] Galperin, op. cit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[6] Bernie Hogan, \u201cReal-Name Sites Are Necessarily Inadequate for Free Speech,\u201d Social Media Collective blog, Aug. 8, 2011, http://socialmediacollective.org/\u200b2011/\u200b08/\u200b08/\u200breal-name-sites-are-necessarily-inadequate-for-fre\u200be-speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[7] Danah Boyd, \u201cReal Name Policies Are an Abuse of Power,\u201d Social Media Collective blog, Aug. 4, 2011, www.zephoria.org/\u200bthoughts/\u200barchives/\u200b2011/\u200b08/\u200b04/\u200breal-names.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[8]Ibid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to top\n\nBibliography\n\nBooks\n\nAboujaoude, Elias , Virtually You: The Dangerous Powers of E-Personality , W.W.

here tomorrow\nI'm hopin' that I can borrow\nA peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important\nMy mind is really distorted\nI find nothing but trouble in my life\nI'm fortunate you believe in a dream\nThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands\nMy plan's rather vindictive\nEverybody's a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back, whispering \"Get 'em!\"\nI got 'em and I ain't give a fuck\nThat same mentality I told my brother not to duck\nIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors\nI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover\nThe life that I knew as a youngin\nIn pajamas and dun-ta-duns\nWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb\nNiggas like me never prosper\nPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted\nThis Piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever\nAnd I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did\nJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big\nAnd if I die before your album drop, I hope\u2014 [Gunshots]\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $141You might also like[Chorus]\nPromise that you will sing about

me\n[Verse 2]\nYou wrote a song about my sister on your tape\nAnd called it Section.80\nThe message resembled \"Brenda's Got a Baby\"\nWhat's crazy was I was hearin' about it\nBut doubted your ignorance\nHow could you ever just put her on blast and shit?\nJudgin' her past and shit?\nWell, it's completely my future\nHer nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit\nAnd I'ma need that forty dollars\nEven if I got to fuck, suck and swallow\nIn the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed\nBy a married man, and father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys\nMatter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's\nHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last week\nThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em\nSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em\nBack to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman\nOr better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'\nThen you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught\nThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I'm exhausted, but fuck that \"Sorry for your loss\" shit\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain\nIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in?\nI'll wait\u2026 Your rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song\n'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own\nAnd matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight\nI'll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate\nAnd I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'\nI'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'\nYou lyin' to these motherfuckers\nTalkin' about you can help 'em with my story\nYou can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...\n[Chorus]\nWhen the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about

me\n\n[Verse 3]\nSometimes I look in the mirror\nAnd ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?\nIf it's today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about, \u2019cause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest\nAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak on somethin'\nThat's realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"It need to be told\"\nCursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'\nOr steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's\nI count lives, all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong\nFightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone\nAm I worth it? Did I put enough work in?\n\n[Chorus]\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Outro]\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\n[Part II: \"I'm Dying of Thirst\"]\n\n[Skit]\n(On the phone)\n\"Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?\"\n\"Nigga, the homie's brother\u2014nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!\"\n\"Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.\"\n\"We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we\u2014nigga, we right here, my nigga.\"\n\"Bring a nigga back a black!\"\n\"Nigga\u2014bruh\u2014nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga.

Ha ha ha! We love you\nHow many people are proud to be citizens\nOf this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars\nFor the rights that men have died for to protect?\nThe women and men who have broke their necks\nFor the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold\u2026\u00a0or so we're told\n(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see\nSo many motherfuckin' people who feel like me\nWho share the same views and the same exact beliefs\nIt's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me\nSo many lives I touched, so much anger aimed\nIn no particular direction, just sprays and sprays\nAnd straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays\n'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days\nWho would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair\nWith some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear\nThat I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?\nHow could I predict my words would have an impact like this?\nI must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office\n'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems\nAnd now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government\nI'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on\n[Chorus]\nWhite America!

Erica loves my shit\nI go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself\nIf they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf\nBut Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help\nMake ladies swoon, baby (Ooh, baby!) \u2014 Look at my sales!\nLet's do the math: If I was black, I would've sold half\nI ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that\nBut I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back\nGive me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at\nWhen I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white\nNo labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like\n\"Fuck it,\" until I met Dre, the only one to look past\nGave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass\nHelped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got\nWas prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got\nLike damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow\nI'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now?

sendin' this one out\nTo my man, Killer B\nNo doubt indeed\nWhere that weed?\nNomsayin'?\nThat old real shit\n\n[Verse 1: Prodigy]\nThere's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from\nYou could run, but you can't hide forever\nFrom these streets that we done took\nYou walkin' with your head down, scared to look\nYou shook, \u2018cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks\nThey never around when the beef cooks in my part of town\nIt's similar to Vietnam\nNow we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control\nThey better have the riot gear ready\nTryin' to bag me and get rocked steady\nBy the MAC one-double, I touch you\nAnd leave you with not much to go home with\nMy skin is thick, \u2018cause I be up in the mix of action\nIf I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'\nNew York got a nigga depressed\nSo I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess\nGod bless my soul\nBefore I put my foot down and begin to stroll\nInto the drama I built\nAnd all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed\nPut us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk\nI'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me\nAnd if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me\nLord, forgive me\nThe Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act\nI'm fallin' and I can't turn back\nOr maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black\nThat I can't say so it's left a untold fact\nUntil my death, my goal's to stay alive\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive\n[Chorus: Havoc]\nYo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive\n(We still livin' it)\nWe livin'

dough get low the jewels go\nBut never that, as long as fiends smoke crack\nI'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks\nNo doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution\nFive-oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system\nNiggas usin' fake names to get out quick\nMy brother did it and got bagged with two ounces\nI live a world where squads hit the block hard\nAsk my man Twin when he got bagged\nThat fucked me up, God, but shit happens for a reason\nYou find out who's your true peoples\nWhen you're upstate bleedin'\nYou can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you\nHit with a two to four is difficult\nWild on the streets, I try to maintain\nTight with my loot, \u2018cause hoes like to run game\nSome niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit\nI'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip\nPushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet\nNo matter how much loot I get\nI'm stayin' in the projects forever\nJakes on the blocks we out-clever\nIf beef, we never separate and pull together\nWhen worst comes to worst, my peoples come first\nTry to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt\nMy crew's all about loot\u2014fuck lookin' cute!\nI'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits\nPuffin L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell\nIn the Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell\nYou better realize\nYou might also like[Chorus: Mobb Deep]\nYo, yo, we livin' this

You already know\nWho's fully capable, the two caped heroes\nDial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero\nYou can even call collect, the most feared duet\nSince me and Elton played career Russian Roulette\nAnd never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat\nPeople steppin' over people just to rush to the set\nJust to get to see an MC who breathes so freely\nEase over these beats and be so breezy\nJesus, how can shit be so easy?\nHow can one Chandra be so Levy?\nTurn on these beats, MCs don't see me\nBelieve me, BET and MTV\nAre gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy\nCan't leave rap alone, the game needs me\n'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear\nInto the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here\nBut we ain't fuckin' around 'round here\nYo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a \"hell...\"? (Hell yeah!)\n[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]\nNow let's get down to business\nI don't got no time to play around, what is this?\nMust be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down\nOn these clowns; can I get a witness?

stone\nSome may never figure out their purpose in life and some will\nThere are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in\nContent with being blinded by rules and judgment\nWe live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead\nIn this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to\nBeing a leader in this day and age is being a threat\nNot many people stood up against the system we all call life\nBut toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice\nA voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time\nA voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest\nThis is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too\nThis is the story of the Man on the MoonYou might also like26Embed"}, {"name": "Drip Too Hard (Lil Baby & Gunna)", "artist": "Lil Baby", "lyrics": "TranslationsT\u00fcrk\u00e7eDanskDrip

a record\nI can take apart the remote control\nAnd I can almost put it back together\nI can tie a knot in a cherry stem\nI can tell you about Leif Ericson\nI know all the words to \"De Colores\"\nAnd I'm proud to be an American\nMe and my friends saw a platypus\nMe and my friend made a comic book\nAnd guess how long it took?\nI can do anything that I want 'cause look\u2014\n[Chorus 1]\nI can keep rhythm with no metronome\nNo metronome, no metronome\nAnd I can see your face on the telephone\nOn the telephone, on the telephone\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook at me, look at me\nJust called to say that it's good to be\nAlive, in such a small world\nI'm all curled up with a book to read\nI can make money, open up a thrift store\nI can make a living off a magazine\nI can design an engine sixty-four miles to a gallon of gasoline\nI can make new antibiotics\nI can make computers survive aquatic conditions\nI know how to run a business\nAnd I can make you wanna buy a product\nMovers, shakers, and producers\nMe and my friends understand the future\nI see the strings that control the systems\nI can do anything with no resistance 'cause\u2014\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI can lead a nation with a microphone\nWith a microphone, with a microphone\nAnd I can split the atom of a molecule\nOf a molecule, of a molecule\nYou might also like[Trumpet Solo]\u200b\n\n[Verse 3]\nLook at me, look at me, driving and I won't stop\nAnd it feels so good to be alive and on top\nMy reach is global, my tower secure\nMy cause is noble, my power is pure\nI can hand out a million vaccinations\nOr let 'em all die in exasperation\nHave 'em all healed from their lacerations\nOr have 'em all killed by assassination\nI can make anybody go to prison\nJust because I don't like 'em\nAnd I can do anything with no permission\nI have it all under my command because\u2014\n\n[Chorus 3]\nI can guide a missile by satellite\nBy satellite, by satellite\nAnd I can hit a target through a telescope\nThrough a telescope,

this\nQueen, I ain't seen you in a minute\nWrote this letter, and finally decide to send it\nSigned, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together\nLove has no limit, let's spend it slow forever\nI know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you\nI ain't gon' assault them, \u2018cause I probably did it too\nBecause of you, feelings I handle with care\nSome niggas recognize the light, but they can't handle the glare\nYou know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts\nIf relationship is effort, I will match your work\nI want to be the one to make you happiest and hurt you the most\nThey say the end is near, it's important that we close.. to the Most High\nRegardless of what happen, on Him let's rely\n[Hook]\nThere are times\nWhen you'll need someone\nI will be by your side\nThere is a light that shines\nSpecial for you and me\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's important we communicate\nAnd tune the fate of this union to the right pitch\nI never call you my bitch, or even my boo\nThere's so much in a name, and so much more in you\nFew understand the union of woman and man\nAnd sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land\nBut that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write\nFor in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light\nIf Heaven had a height, you would be that tall\nGhetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all\nLet's stick to understandin' and we won't fall\nFor better or worse times, I hope to me you call\nSo I pray every day more than anythin'\nFriends we'll stay as we begin to lay\nThis foundation for a family, love ain't simple\nWhy can't it be anythin' worth havin' you work at annually?\nGranted we known each other for some time\nIt don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine\nYou might also like[Hook]\nThere are times\nWhen you'll need

beauty to thrift shop\nPlus you shit pop when it's time to\nThinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to\nAt times when I'm lost I try to find you\nYou know to give me space when it's time to\nMy heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness\nTruthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence\nThe time we committed love, it was real good\nHad to be for me to arrive and it still feel good\nI know the sex ain't gon' keep you\nBut as my equal, it's how I must treat you\nAs my reflection in light I'ma lead you\nAnd whatever's right I'ma feed you\nDigga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da\nYo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!\n\n[Hook]\nThere are times\nWhen you'll need someone\nI will be by your side\nThere is a light that shines\nSpecial for you

called me Dumbo\nTwenty years ago, can't forget\nNow I can lend him a ear or two\nHow to stack these residuals tenfold\nThe liberal concept of what men'll do\n\"20 on 6,\" he didn't hear me\nIndigenous African only spoke Zulu\nMy American tongue was leery\nWalked out the gas station\nA homeless man with a semi-tan complexion\nAsked me for ten Rand, stressin' about dry land\nDeep water, powder blue skies that crack open\nA piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'\nHe begged and pleaded\nAsked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it\nTold him, \"Beat it\"\nContributin' money just for his pipe\u2014I couldn't see it\nHe said, \"My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated\nListen to me, I want a single bill from you\nNothin' less, nothin' more\"\nI told him I ain't have it and closed my door\nTell me, how much a dollar cost?\n[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]\nIt's more to feed your mind\nWater, sun and love, the one you love\nAll you need,

leave\nAnd somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see\nThe reason why he was mad at a stranger\nLike I was supposed to save him\nLike I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor\nHe's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser\nHe's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious\n'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect\nIf I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck\nI never understood someone beggin' for goods\nAskin' for handouts, takin' it if they could\nAnd this particular person just had it down pat\nStarin' at me for the longest until he finally asked\n\"Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?\nA humble man is all that we ever need\"\nTell me, how much a dollar cost?\n[Chorus: James

I can't say no to nobody\nAnd at this rate, we gon' both die broke\nGot friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt\nAnd like my wife said, I still didn't say no\nPeople tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter\nMy friends' best advice was to stay low\nI guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills\nEspecially when you got family members on payroll\nThe media said it was outlandish spendin'\nThe media said he's way out of control\nI just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'\nI'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control\nI know I'm the most influential\nThat TIME cover was just confirmation\nThis generation's closest thing to Einstein\nSo don't worry about me, I'm fine\nI can see a thousand years from now in real life\nSkate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like\nTroll conventional thought, don't need to question\nI know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive\nThank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission\nDid it with no permission, on our own conditions\nMost blacks with money have been beaten to submission\nYeezy with the big house, did it way different\nNever listen to Hollywood producers\nDon't stare at money too long, it's Medusa\nThe ultimate Gemini has survived\nI wasn't supposed to make it past 25\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\nWonderin' whether

believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro\nIf the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho\nBrother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation\nHe sat back and smiled\nBlack on black lies is worse than black on black crime\nThe Jews share their truth on how to make a dime\nMost black men couldn't balance a checkbook\nBut buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, \"How my neck look?\"\nWell, it all looks great\nFour hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains\nThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard\nReal family stick together and see through the mirage\nThe smokescreens, perceptions of false reality\nWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?\nI am one with the people\nI am one with the people (Real!)\nI've been woken from enlightened man's dream\nCheckin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem\nLet me not say too much or do too much\n'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch\nI'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen\nSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'\nGod, I have humbled myself before the court\nDrop my ego when confidence was my last resort\nI know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I turned on the news and they was buryin' me\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me\nTold Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see\nI would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov\nI heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove\nBut it's better that I stayed at home with my folks\n'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke\nOnly thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go\nWe all go\nNot just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\n\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"\n\n[Saxophone Solo]\n\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\n\n[Hiphop: \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\"]\n\nI'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"\n\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\n[JAY-Z: \"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"]\nAnd he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\n[JAY-Z: \"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"]\n\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"So what you think of this?\"]\n\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n\n[Donda West: \"Come on, let's just go\"]\n\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n\n[Donda West: \"Kanye, baby, we're here\"]\n\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\n[Hiphop: \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"]\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\n[Dame: \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"]\n\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\n[Dame: \"Jay got classics, G.\"]\n\nYou know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"]\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them \"Jesus Walks\" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\n[Jessica: \"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"]\n\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\n\n[\"Y'all niggas is stupid\"]\n\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\n\n[Joe: \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"]\n\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\n[Dame: \"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"]\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\n[Dame: \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"]\n\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\n[Dame: \"it's actually kinda hot.\"]\n\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\n[Dame: \"you don't wanna catch a brick\"]\n\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\n[Mel: \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\"]\n\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?142Embed"}, {"name": "Jungle", "artist": "Drake", "lyrics": "TranslationsT\u00fcrk\u00e7eJungle Lyrics[Chorus: Gabriel Garz\u00f3n Montano]\nRock me real slowly\nPut a bib on me\nI'm just like a baby, droolin' over you\nThe things you do\n\n[Verse 1: Drake]\nThese days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me\nThe things I can't change are the reason you love me\nListen, you can hear them callin' my name\nI'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place\nI'm not ashamed at all\nStill findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'\nFeel like we one and the same, our relationship changed\nThat, or it never existed\nWhenever they say somethin' 'bout us, you listen\nBut fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline\nThat's cuttin' all into my time with you\nFuck what they talkin' about on your timeline\nThat's cuttin' all into my time with you\nMy time with you, my\n[Chorus: Gabriel Garz\u00f3n Montano]\nRock me real slowly\nPut a bib on me\nI'm just like a baby, droolin' over you\nThe things you do\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nShe said, \"You're my everything\"\n\"I love you through everything\"\nI done did everything to her\nShe forgave me for everything\nThis a \"forever\" thing\nHate that I treat it like it's a \"whatever\" thing\nTrust me, girl, this shit is everything to me\nShe from the jungle\nShe from the jungle\nI take somebody else's car, drive there undercover\nThis shit is everything to me\nThis shit is everything\nDon't know where we stand\nI used to hit you 'bout everything, oh\n\n[Bridge: Drake]\nAre we still good?

plays in ways the mind can't figure out\nHeart plays in ways the mind can't\u2014\nHeart plays in ways the mind can't figure out\nThis is how we conceptualize human beings\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nMy auntie is a man now\nI think I'm old enough to understand now\nDrinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards\nMotorola pager, off-white Guess jacket\nBlue Air Max's, gold chains, and curl kits\n'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest\nBig social, big personality, vocal\nPlayed the underground verbatim and stayed local\nMy auntie is a man now\nI watch him and his girl hold their hands down\nTip of the avenues under street lights made his\nThinking, \"I want me a bad bitch when I get big\"\nThey hug on the corner like California king\nCold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road\nSee, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado\nScratching the likes from lotto\nHoping that she pull up tomorrow\nSo I can hang out in the front seat\nSix by nines keeping the music up under me\nMy auntie is a man now\nAsked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much\nAnd at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much\nShe said, \"Ain't no tellin'\nNiggas always been jealous because he had more women\nMore money and more attention made more envy\nCalling him anything but broke was less offending\"\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nMy auntie is a man now\nI think I'm old enough to understand now\nDrinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards\nBack when it was comedic relief to say, \"Faggot\"\nFaggot, faggot, faggot, we ain't know no better\nElementary kids with no filter, however\nMy auntie became a man and I took pride in it\nShe wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference\nThat's what I told my friends in second grade\nShe picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face\nThey couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed\nWe pull off bumpin' Quik like it was nothing\nMy auntie is a man now, what a relationship\nI grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit\nHe gave me some cash then gave me some game\nCherry freshener on the dash, I never complained\nShe even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade\nThe first person I seen write a rap\nThat's when my life had changed\nHouse full of demo, smoke stuck on the window\nCameras on the microphone, all women and men though\nMy auntie was a man now, we cool with it\nThe history had trickled down and made us ign'ant\nMy favorite cousin said he's returning the favor\nAnd following my auntie with the same behavior\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $141You might also

world's gonna bring you down)\nConvincing themselves, \"He ain't living discreet, he's fine\" (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)\nThey said they never seen it in him, but I seen it (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nThe Barbie dolls played off reflection of Venus (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nHe built a wall so tall you couldn't climb over\nHe didn't laugh as hard when the kids start joking (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\"Faggot, faggot, faggot,\" we ain't know no better\nMiddle school kids with no filter, however\nI had to be very mindful of my good cousin\nI knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nI mean he's really Mary-Ann, even took things further\nChanged his gender before Bruce Jenner was certain\nLiving his truth even if it meant see a surgeon\nWe didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant\nWasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive\nBut I recall we both had a sick sense of humor\nMade raw, but time changes all\n\n[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nRemember church, Easter Sunday?\nI sat in the pew, you had stronger faith\nMore spiritual when these dudes were living life straight\nWhich I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same\nHe said my cousin was going through some things\nHe promised the world we living in was an act on abomination\nAnd Demetrius was to blame\nI knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman\nWondering if God still call you a decent man\nStill you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint\nUntil he singled you out to prove his point, saying\n\"Demetrius is Mary-Ann now\nChurch, his auntie is a man now,\" it hurt\nYou the most 'cause your belief was close to his words\nForcing me to stand now\nI said, \"Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?\nThe laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?\nI recognize the study she was taught since birth\nBut that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved\"\nThe building was thinking out loud, bad angel\nThat's when you looked at me and smiled, said, \"Thank you\"\nThe day I chose humanity over religion\nThe family got closer, it was all forgiven\nI said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better\nMistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different\nSee, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound\nIf ever they was pronounced without any intentions\nThe very second you challenged the shit I was kicking\nReminded me about a show I did out the city\nThat time I brung a fan on stage to rap\nBut disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me\nYou said, \"Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction\nTo truly understand love, switch position\n'Faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together\nBut only if you let a white girl say 'Nigga'\"47Embed"},

Whether your earliest musical memories are of The Beatles professing that they love you yeah yeah yeah, your grammar school classmates singing along with Thriller, or Jay Z rapping about his hard knock life, the tunes you hear in your formative years pave the way for what\u2019s to come.\n\nSo it is with hip-hop.  The musical backbone of rap\u2019s most influential era -- the so-called Golden Age of the late 1980s to early 90s -- has its roots in the childhood memories of its creators.  Songs heard in parents\u2019 dens or at dances got chopped up, dissected, and scientifically rearranged.\n\nA few seconds of solo drums in the middle of a song would become the basis for a whole new creation.  A guitar stab, grunt, or horn riff took on new life as the canvas for an emcee or group to paint on.  And anything was fair game.  Cheesy pop songs, novelties, movie soundtracks -- as long as it was funky, it made the cut.  It was all about the breaks.\n\nAt the very beginning of hip-hop culture, there was the break.  A DJ named Clyde Campbell working parties in the Bronx in the early 1970s discovered that people loved the moments in songs where everything would drop out except the drums, or occasionally the drums and bass.  But these instrumental sections were almost always short -- a few seconds or a minute.  How to keep the party going?\n\nCampbell, who was dj\u2019ing under the name \u201cKool Herc,\u201d invented a technique he called \u201cthe Merry-Go-Round.\u201d  It involved finding those key moments in each record, and going right from one to the other.  He\u2019d start with James Brown\u2019s \u201cGive It Up or Turn It Loose,\u201d a favorite among b-boys to this day (it\u2019s the one old-schoolers call \u201cClap your hands, stomp your feet,\u201d after Brown\u2019s exhortation at the beginning of the break).  Then he\u2019d transition into \u201cBongo Rock\u201d from the Incredible Bongo Band, and go right into Babe Ruth\u2019s \u201cThe Mexican.\u201d  Or, even better, he\u2019d take two copies of the same record and switch back and forth, extending a single break into infinity.  The dancers loved it -- all of their favorite moments that they\u2019d previously had to wait for, now happening one after another, in an endless wave of funky drums.\n\nBy the time rap music made it to record in 1979, the concept of extending a single breakbeat was transferred onto the new genre.  The early records featured popular songs of the era either sampled or replayed, with grooves that had once rocked the dance floor now expected to rock the pockets of record buyers.\nFamiliarity may breed contempt, but to early hip hop record makers, it also bred success.  Chic\u2019s monster hit \u201cGood Times,\u201d released that very year, formed the basis for dozens of early rap songs, including the biggest one of all, \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d by the Sugarhill Gang. Cheryl Lynn\u2019s \u201cGot to be Real\u201d from the previous year was another one whose groove was used over and over.\n\nBut the breaks used at the earliest parties showed up as well.  As the genre grew and more records started being made, the tunes that folks remembered from the parties they had attended as kids ten or so years prior began showing up in their raps.  By the mid-1980s, records like The Incredible Bongo Band\u2019s \u201cApache,\u201d the Honeydrippers\u2019 \u201cImpeach the President,\u201d or any number of James Brown cuts began appearing in earnest as the backing to rap records.\n\nAnd then 1986 hit, and nothing was the same.  Two enigmatic figures known as \u201cBreakbeat Lou\u201d and \u201cBreakbeat Lenny\u201d put out the first volume of an anthology that would shake up the world and change the sound of rap forever.  Louie Flores and Lenny Roberts released the first of what would become 25 volumes of a series called Ultimate Breaks and Beats.\n\nThese were wide-ranging, extremely illegal compilations that included songs favored by DJs for their breaks.  The first volume contained tunes ranging from The Monkees\u2019 \u201cMary Mary\u201d to Rufus Thomas\u2019 novelty \u201cDo the Funky Penguin.\u201d  But it was the third song, \u201cAmen Brother\u201d by The Winstons, that would push the project over the edge.  The drum solo in that tune became so popular that it eventually got its own name -- the \u201c\u2018Amen\u2019 break.\u201d  It showed up in NWA (\u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d), Salt-N-Pepa (\u201cI Desire\u201d), the Ultramagnetic MCs (\u201cCritical Beatdown\u201d), and countless other dope late-80s tracks.  It also took on a second life in the 90s, as it appeared in sped-up form in nearly every drum-n-bass song of the era.\n\nMore than any individual tune, though, it was the idea of having all of the hottest breaks in one easy-to-find place that made the series take off.  Until the series stopped in 1991, the tunes on UBB became the backbone of the genre.  The songs on the 25 volumes ranged from 1966 to 1984, with the vast majority unsurprisingly dating from the 70s, the same era as the parties where breakbeats first ruled.  Every producer of the era, whether they copped to it or not, used breaks found somewhere on the compilations.  They defined the sound of the era.\n\nThe series ceased right around the time sampling laws tightened up, and using breaks became considerably more expensive.  The classic breaks are now far too identifiable, so current producers engage in a cat-and-mouse game of finding more and more obscure breaks, or trying to alter them enough to be unrecognizable.\n\nLuckily for the inquisitive listener of today, UBB was reissued (still illegally!) a few years ago as a set of 2 CDs containing all 25 volumes on MP3, so it\u2019s possible to find if you look hard enough.\n\nWhat Makes a Break?\n\u201cI\u2019m ripping emcees from \u2018Funky Drummer\u2019 to \u2018Big Beat\u2019\u201d\n-- LL Cool J, \u201cMurdergram\u201d\n\nSo why have some breaks been used over and over?  What makes a good break beat?  First off, from a producer\u2019s perspective, ease of use is important.  Having only the drums playing makes a breakbeat easy to sample and loop -- there are no difficult decisions on how to cut out the vocals or other instruments.\n\nIt is this simple qualification that many of rap\u2019s most sampled breaks have in common.  In 2010, the website Who Sampled put together a list of the most-sampled breaks of all time.  The vast majority of them -- eight out of ten -- were from between 1969 and 1973, with just one outlier on each end of that time period.  In almost all of them, there were between two and eight bars of solo drums.\n\nWhat does that mean to you as a listener?  First off, certain popular breaks have become a part of the language and meaning of rap songs.  When a contemporary song uses \u201cApache\u201d from the Incredible Bongo Band (from 1973, #6 on the list), it\u2019s used not only because it\u2019s a dope break.  The sample\u2019s existence is itself a reference to its popularity in early park jams, and also to the hundreds of times the beat has been sampled since 1981.  Jay Z and Kanye West used these associations astutely on the 2011 track \u201cThat\u2019s My Bitch.\u201d  The song foregrounded an \u201cApache\u201d sample, but also included an homage to Public Enemy and a lyrical shoutout to Golden Age rapper Monie Love.  All of these things worked in tandem to add an intended subtext of, as Digital Underground put it, \u201ca tribute to the early days.\u201d\n\nIn fact, as early as 1987, \u201cApache\u201d was used to signify those same early days.  A sample of the song was used on Kool Moe Dee\u2019s \u201cWay Way Back,\u201d on which he used a self-consciously dated style to pay tribute to his roots.  Likewise, Busy Bee used the \u201cApache\u201d break on his 1988 song \u201cOld School.\u201d  Immediately after the break plays, his first words are, \u201cOh man, that\u2019s that old school.\u201d  Without the knowledge of the break\u2019s history, that ad-lib would fall on deaf ears, and in fact the whole concept of the song would be nonsensical.\nThat same sample could also serve as a canvas for innovation.  Kool G. Rap used it for his 1989 tune \u201cMen At Work,\u201d  whose polysyllabic rhymes left a lifelong impression on a whole generation of emcees (to this day, Black Thought of The Roots can still rap the tune perfectly word-for-word).  The tune had all the more impact for including advanced lyricism against a familiar template, where listeners were used to hearing the simplistic end-line rhymes of The Sugarhill Gang or the schoolyard chants of Busy Bee.\n\nIn truth, a solid knowledge of the soul and funk of the late 1960s and 1970s is essential to really understanding hip-hop.  Being able to identify the bells on Bob James\u2019 classic \u201cTake Me to the Mardi Gras\u201d (1974) or the drums of Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cChocolate Buttermilk\u201d (1969) will add layers upon layers to your enjoyment of rap songs.\n\nCan\u2019t Stop the Rock: Rock & Roll and Other Outliers\n\u201cI\u2019m the King of Rock, there is none higher/Sucker emcees should call me \u2018Sire\u2019\u201d\n-- Run-DMC, \u201cKing of Rock\u201d\n\nOne of the oddities on Who Sampled\u2019s list provides another important clue to unlocking the mysteries of the break beat.  Number nine on the list is \u201cThe Big Beat,\u201d a 1980 track by hard rocker Billy Squier.  The song didn\u2019t chart, and would have been forgotten, despite its charming stop-motion-filled video , if not for rap.  Its opening drum break was immediately adopted by rappers -- by 1981, it was already a staple of many artists\u2019 live performances.\n\nSo what does this mean?  That rappers were anxiously awaiting Billy Squier\u2019s first solo album?  Of course not.  The break was adopted because it had open drums, was right at the beginning of the song, and sounded great.  That it was on a hard-rock record mattered not a bit.\n\nThis catholic approach to sampling has been true of hip-hop from the beginning, and continues to be so today.  Popular Golden Age breaks came from funk and soul records, to be sure.  But they also came from jazz, hard rock, and even The Monkees, the only-on-television 1960s \u201cband\u201d whose \u201cMary Mary\u201d was adopted by De La Soul, Run-DMC, J.J. Fad, and 2 Live Crew proteges Anquette.  If something sounded good, the source didn\u2019t matter.\n\nThis approach, of reshaping good bits no matter where they\u2019re from, goes back very far in hip-hop\u2019s DNA.  Afrika Bambaataa, one of the genre\u2019s foremost pioneers, was famous for it.  During hip-hop\u2019s early years, he would throw parties where he would play everything -- electronic music, video game soundtracks, calypso -- with an unerring ear for what would both surprise people and keep the party moving.  His record collection, which is now preserved at Cornell University, grew to over 40,000 strong, and he became known as the \u201cMaster of Records.\u201d  That same adventurousness is preserved even in today\u2019s big stars -- Jay Z\u2019s sample of Gonjasufi, Kanye West taking from 1970s Hungarian rockers Omega, and more.\n\nThe Godfather: James Brown and the Break Beat\n\u201cTell the truth, James Brown was old/\u2019Til Eric and Ra came out with \u2018I Got Soul\u2019\u201d\n-- Stetsasonic, \u2018Talkin All That Jazz\u2019\n\nNo discussion of break beats is complete without an examination of James Brown.  Tracks that he either performed on or produced have been sampled well over 5,000 times, making him by far the most-sampled artist of all time.\n\nWhy is that?  As with so many things in hip-hop, and in history generally, there is no one monolithic answer.  Brown\u2019s cultural impact was unparalleled during the 1960s and 70s -- remember that showing a concert of his on television in the wake of MLK\u2019s death was pretty much the only thing that kept the city of Boston from rioting.  His call to \u201csay it loud, I\u2019m black and I\u2019m proud\u201d and his self-reliant cry that \u201cI don\u2019t want nobody to get me nothing/Open up the door, I\u2019ll get it myself\u201d had a huge impact on black people (and also cost him a lot of his white audience).\nMusically, Brown more or less single-handedly invented the hard-edged funk that would come to dominate the 1970s.  He took the traditions of rhythm and blues music and stripped them down to almost nothing -- a few words (often made up on the spot), a groove, and often just a single chord.\n\nSomehow, the force of his personality -- and an unerring nose for finding great musicians -- made it all work, and songs like \u201cSuper Bad\u201d and \u201cGet Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\u201d created what we now think of as funk.\n\nJames\u2019 influence extended far beyond his own tunes.  The songs he co-wrote and produced for other members of his camp became classics as well.  Lyn Collins (\u201cThink (About It)\u201d) and Bobby Byrd (\u201cI Know You Got Soul\u201d) used Brown\u2019s band The J.B.\u2019s to produce great records in the vein of the master.  And The J.B.\u2019s themselves released a ton of instrumentals in the 1970s that stand alongside Brown\u2019s greatest work.  Even former members of Brown\u2019s band got in on the act.  The sibling team of William \u201cBootsy\u201d Collins on bass and Phelps \u201cCatfish\u201d Collins on guitar, who played with Brown briefly in 1970-1, became key members of the legendary Parliament-Funkadelic collective after leaving the group.\n\nWhat does this all have to do with breaks?  First off, James\u2019 early funk songs were repetitive grooves.  While played straight through by the musicians, their circular nature connects them to the four- and eight-bar loops of early rap.  Also, the extended length of many of the tunes meant that there were lots of moments without vocals for burgeoning producers to sample.  And then there were the drum breaks.\n\n\u201cFunky Drummer,\u201d number two on Who Sampled\u2019s list, is a prime example.  The song itself is a seven-minute mellow bit of funk that consists almost entirely of a one-bar vamp.  Brown emotes and plays some organ on top of the groove.\n\nThen, almost five minutes in, Brown starts giving the band instructions for an upcoming drum break.   \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do no soloing, brother.  Just keep what you got!\u201d he tells drummer Clyde Stubblefield.  And 45 seconds later, Stubblefield does just that.  Everyone drops out, and perhaps the most famous eight bars in the history of funk begins.\n\nThe beat -- a barrage of ghost notes, hi-hat openings and closings, and a tricky syncopated kick drum pattern -- would echo down through the decades.  Starting in the mid-1980s, the beat became a staple in hip-hop.  Other Brown songs would soon follow, creating renewed interest in the master\u2019s work.  While all eras of his career would be fair game for samplers, his \u201chard funk\u201d period that began with 1967\u2019s \u201cCold Sweat\u201d and continued through 1976 makes up the vast majority of the sampled tunes.\n\nThe funk and soul of the late 1960s and 1970s, Brown especially, is the DNA of hip-hop.  It worked its way into the genre\u2019s sound, its emcees rhythms, and even its lyrical preoccupations.  From Biggie\u2019s \u201cfunk flow to make your drawers drop slow\u201d to \u201cRedman on the funk train,\u201d the sound, feel, attitude, and cool of the funk pioneers has been a guiding light in the rap world.\n\nIn addition to Brown, his proteges in the Parliament-Funkadelic collective had a huge influence on the sound of West Coast rap in particular.  Dr. Dre\u2019s breakthrough 1992 solo album The Chronic, a record that came to define the so-called \u201cG-funk\u201d sound, featured ten different samples from either Parliament, Funkadelic, or the collective\u2019s leader George Clinton, where no other artist was sampled more than once.\n\nKool & the Gang, before having smash success with crossover hits like \u201cHollywood Swingin\u2019,\u201d released funky instrumental tracks that would later be raided by producers.  Their 1969 debut record would be used by pioneers like Eric B and Rakim, Stetsasonic, X-Clan, NWA, Special Ed, A Tribe Called Quest, and more.\n\nWhile breakbeats were originally used to keep the party going, they came to be much more than that.  They were a way for producers to use the music that was most familiar to them in order to create something exciting and new.  And later, they began to signify themselves -- that is, to represent all of the other times that particular break has been used.  That, ultimately, is the magic of breaks, and their ever-shifting meaning over time is as hip-hop as anything else about them.20Embed"}, {"name": "Coming Home", "artist": "Diddy - Dirty Money", "lyrics": "Coming Home Lyrics[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nI'm comin' home, I'm comin' home\nTell the world I'm comin' home\nLet the rain wash away\nAll the pain of yesterday\nI know my kingdom awaits\nAnd they've forgiven my mistakes\nI'm comin' home, I'm comin' home\nTell the world I'm comin'\n\n[Intro: Diddy]\nI'm back where I belong (Uh, yeah)\nI never felt so strong, ayy (Yeah, I'm back, baby)\nI'm feelin' like there's nothin' that I can't try (Uh, nothin')\nAnd if you with me put your hands high (Yeah, put your hands high)\nHigh, ayy (If you ever lost a life before, this one's for you)\nAnd if you with me put your hands high (And you, the dreams are for you rockin' with the best)\nHigh, ayy (And you, and you)\nI'll be home soon\n[Verse 1: Diddy]\nI hear the \"Tears of a Clown,\" uh, I hate that song\nI always feel like they're talkin' to me, when it comes on (Come on)\nAnother day, another dawn\nAnother Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone\nWhat am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on?\nIt's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean (Come on)\nWhat if my twins ask me why I ain't marry their mom?

Are you deceiving me?\nCould I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?\nIs your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?\nWould you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?\nIf I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off\nIf the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car\nWould you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?\nOr question my character and degrade me on every blog?\nWant you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson\nI freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome\nYou tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing\nBut a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question:\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $141You might also like[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWon't you look to your left and right?

Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?\nEven though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?\nLike, who got your best interest?\nLike, how much are you dependent?\nHow clutch are the people that say they love you?\nAnd who pretending?\nHow tough is your skin when they turn you in?\nDo you show forgiveness?\nWhat brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?\nWhat kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?\nWhat kind of bridge did they burn?\nRevenge on your mind when it's mentioned\nYou wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson\nYou wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom\nYou wanna be remembered that delivered the message\nThat considered the blessing of everyone\nThis your lesson for everyone, say;\n[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWon't you look to your left and right?

was conflicted\nMisusing your influence\nSometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power, full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screaming in the hotel room\nI didn't wanna self destruct\nThe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went running for answers\nUntil I came home\nBut that didn't stop survivor's guilt\nGoing back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned\nOr maybe how A-1 my foundation was\nBut while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city\nI was entering a new one\nA war that was based on apartheid and discrimination\nMade me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned\nThe word was respect\nJust because you wore a different gang color than mine's\nDoesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man\nForgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets\nIf I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us\nBut I don't know, I'm no mortal man\nMaybe I'm just another nigga\u201d\nShit and that's all I wrote\nI was gonna call it \"Another Nigga\" but, it ain't really a poem\nI just felt like it's something you probably could relate to\nOther than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you\nI always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-\nAbout a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground\nWhat you mean by that, what the ground represent?\nThe ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil\nRight\nThat's how I see it, my word is bond\nI see\u2014and the ground is the symbol for the poor people\nRight\nThe poor people is gonna open up this whole world\nAnd swallow up the rich people\n'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat\nAnd they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I'm saying Wealthy, appetizing\nThe poor gonna be so poor, and hungry\nRight\nYou know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like\nYou know what I'm saying, it's gonna be\nThere might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-\nThey might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?\nAight so let me ask you this then\nDo you see yourself as somebody that's rich\nOr somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?\nI see myself as a natural born hustler\nA true hustler in every sense of the word\nI took nothin', I took the opportunities\nI worked at the most menial and degrading job\nAnd built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it\nI went from having somebody managing me\nTo me hiring the person that works my management company\nI changed everything, I realized my destiny\nIn a matter of five years, you know what I'm saying?\nI made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people\nNow it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying?\nI made millions for the record companies\nI made millions for these movie companies\nNow I make millions for, for us\nAnd through your different avenues of success\nHow would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?\nBy my faith in God, by my faith in the game\nAnd by my faith in \"all good things come to those that stay true\"\nRight\nYou know what I'm saying?\nAnd it was happening to me for a reason\nYou know what I'm saying, I was noticing, shit\nI was punching the right buttons and it was happening\nSo it's no problem, you know\nI mean, it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know\nI'm finna go straight through\nWould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that\nSomebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?\nShit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance\nAnd not only me but, it goes down my family tree\nYou know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back\nAight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like\n\"We fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win\nAnd I wanna lay it all down\"\nIn this country, a black man only have like\n5 years we can exhibit maximum strength\nAnd that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong\nWhile you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back\n'Cause once you turn 30 it's like\nThey take the heart and soul out of a man\nOut of a black man, in this country\nAnd you don't wanna fight no more\nAnd if you don't believe me, you can look around\nYou don't see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers\nThat's crazy, because me being one of your offsprings\nOf the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that\nThere's nothing but turmoil goin' on so, I wanted to ask you\nWhat you think is the future for me and my generation today?\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores\nAnd next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed\nFor real, I don't think America know that\nI think America think we was just playing\nAnd it's gonna be some more playing but\nIt ain't gonna be no playing\nIt's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying?\nIt's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker\nYou know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen\nThat's crazy, man, in my opinion\nOnly hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nLot a people don't understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic\nAnd I don't know what type of energy I'ma push out\nOr where it comes from, trip me out sometimes\nBecause it's spirits, we ain't even really rappin'\nWe just letting our dead homies tell stories for us\nDamn\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIt's actually something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world, it says:\n\u201cThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHe's trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\"\nWhat's your perspective on that?\nPac?
