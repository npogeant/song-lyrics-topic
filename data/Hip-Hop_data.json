right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like\nAnd right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe\nI can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight\nAs long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight\nHigh off her love, drunk from her hate\nIt's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate\nAnd right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me\nShe fuckin' hates me, and I love it \u2014 \"Wait!\nWhere you going?\" \u2014 \"I'm leaving you!\"

Lois Lane\nBut when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed\nI snapped, \"Who's that dude?\", I don't even know his name\nI laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again\nI guess I don't know my own strength\n[Chorus: Rihanna]\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn?\nWell, that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry?\nWell, that's all right

to hurt 'em\nNow you're in each other's face\nSpewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em\nYou push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em\nThrow 'em down, pin 'em\nSo lost in the moments when you're in 'em\nIt's the rage that took over, it controls you both\nSo they say you're best to go your separate ways\nGuess that they don't know ya\n'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over\nIt's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over\nBut you promised her, next time you'll show restraint\nYou don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game\nBut you lied again\nNow you get to watch her leave out the window\nGuess that's why they call it window pane\nYou might also like[Chorus: Rihanna]\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn?\nWell, that's all right

comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please\nCome back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me\nMaybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems\nMaybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano\nAll I know is I love you too much to walk away though\nCome inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk\nDon't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?\nTold you this is my fault, look me

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

Relapse CD was \"ehh\"\nPerhaps I ran them accents into the ground\nRelax, I ain't goin' back to that now\nAll I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!\n'Cause I ain't playin' around\nThere's a game called circle and I don't know how\nI'm way too up to back down\nBut I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out\nThought I had it mapped out\nBut I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud

you\nSo I could come back a brand-new me\nYou helped see me through\nAnd don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you\nI've been through the wringer\nBut they can do little to the middle finger\nI think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of\nMy world, haters can make like bees with no stingers\nAnd drop dead: no more beef lingers\nNo more drama from now on, I promise\nTo focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father\nSo I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it\nYou couldn't lift a single shingle on it\n'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club\nOr the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up\n'Cause I'm raisin' the bar\nI'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars\nI feel amazin', and

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered\n\n100. \"All of the Lights\" - Kanye West\n99. \"No Lie\" - 2 Chainz feat.

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

People keep on givin' in\nMakin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends\nNot respectin' each other, deny thy brother\nA war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover\nThe truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug\nIf you never know truth, then you never know love\nWhere's the love, y'all?

LyricsTo honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever\n\nRap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

Fiasco]\nAnd you better wear your shades\nThe spotlights here can burn holes through the stage\nDown through the basement, past the Indian graves\nWhere the dinosaurs laid and (Pew!)\nOut through China, nearly misses airliners\nMagnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer\nRicochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)\nNow, that's important to say\n'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade\nWe want it to braid\nMeaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay\nLike the governor called, and he told him to wait\nUnstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage\nThe audience ain't fazed\nAnd they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Uh)\nThey want everything back (Back) that they've paid\n'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim\nHa, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha\n[Chorus: Matthew Santos]\nIf you are what you say you are\nA superstar\nThen have no fear, the crowd is here\nAnd the lights are on\nAnd they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah\n[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]\nSo, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away\n'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days\nMe and security ain't getting along, and when I got to the front\nThey told me all of the tickets were gone\nSo just take me home where the mood is mellow\nAnd the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow\nAnd the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker\nEverybody gets a nice autograph picture\nOne for you and one for your sister\nWho had to work tonight but is an avid listener\nEvery song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback\nAll the reviewers say, \"You need to go and see that!\"\nAnd everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased\nAnd then, they all take the stage and start performing for me\nLike, \"Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha\"\n\"Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha\"\n[Chorus: Matthew Santos & Lupe Fiasco]\nIf you are what you say you are\nA superstar\nThen have no fear, the camera's here\nAnd the microphones\nAnd they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh\nIf you are what you say you are\nA superstar (Superstar)\nThen have no fear, the crowd is here\nAnd the lights are on\nAnd they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)\n\n[Outro:

just don't cross, and he crossed it\nI heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it\nIt was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit\nAnd even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it\nI spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted\nAnd I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it\nThis ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it\nThat was never my object, for someone to get killed\nWhy would I wanna destroy somethin' I helped build?\nIt wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good\nI went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****\nAnd that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth\nAnd talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about\nPlus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef\nSo I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth\nWhile he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man\nWho literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand\nThis is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business\nBut still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause\u2014\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nStep by step, heart to heart\nLeft, right, left, we all fall down\nLike toy

him\nUntil Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him\nFuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it\nMeanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction\nSome receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\nHas an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\nTries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\nBut now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up\nWas through that publication, the same one that made me famous\nNow the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?\nWell, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!\nBut I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think\nThat we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.\nAnd he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind\nWe still have soldiers that's on the front line\nWho's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders\nNever to extort us, strictly to show they support us\nAnd maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus\nTo show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important\nIt is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners\nTheir loyalty to us is worth more than any award is\nBut I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered\nIt ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\nThan to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict\nI'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further\nBut don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'\nI'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'\nOff at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'\nI'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience\n'Cause\u2014\n[Chorus]\nStep by step, heart to heart\nLeft, right, left, we all fall down\nLike toy soldiers\nBit by bit, torn apart\nWe never win, but the battle wages on\nFor toy soldiers220Embed"}, {"name": "Kick, Push", "artist": "Lupe Fiasco", "lyrics": "Kick, Push Lyrics[Produced by Soundtrakk]\n\n[Intro]\nUgh!

Monkey\u2019s Head Lyrics[Verse 1: Dennis Hopper]\nOnce upon a time at the foot of a great mountain\nThere was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived\nTheir very existence a mystery to the rest of the world\nObscured as it was by great clouds\nHere, they played out their peaceful lives\nInnocent of the litany of excess and violence\nThat was growing in the world below\nTo live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough\nThen one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town\nThey came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses\nBut no one noticed them, they only saw shadows\nYou see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind\n[Interlude: 2D]\nFalling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes\nWaiting for the sunset to come, people going home\nJump out from behind them and shoot them in the head\nNow everybody dancing, the dance of the dead\nThe dance of the dead, the dance of the dead\n\n[Verse 2: Dennis Hopper]\nIn time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain\nAnd it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty\nBy chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest\nThe Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things\nAnd soon they began to mine the mountain\nIts rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world\nMeanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly\nTheir dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls\nEvery day, people would wake and stare at the mountain\nWhy was it bringing darkness into their lives?\nAnd as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear\nBringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey\nFor the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful\nFor they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep\nAnd then came a sound, distant at first, it grew into castrophany\nSo immense that it could be heard far away in space\nThere were no screams, there was no time\nThe mountain called Monkey had spoken\nThere was only fire, and then... nothing\nSee Gorillaz LiveGet

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture\n\nSo it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation\n\nWhile rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

kills for phone time\nI max like cassettes, I flex like sex\nIn your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck\nI used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive\nWhen I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5\nI drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it\nWith more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach\nNasty Nas has to rise \u2018cause I'm wise\nThis is exercise 'til the microphone dies\nBack in '83, I was an MC sparkin'\nBut I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and\nKick my little raps \u2018cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand\nAnd now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man\nI rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships\nI used to watch \"CHiPs\", now I load Glock clips\nI got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic\nVersatile, my style switches like a faggot\nBut not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap\nI'm a professional, and that's no question, yo\nThese are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?\n\u2018Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man\nAm I in place with the bass and format?\nExplore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that\nAnd next time I rhyme, I be foul\nWhenever I freestyle, I see trial niggas say I'm wild\nI hate a

I'd call you\nIn case I'm not here tomorrow\nI'm hopin' that I can borrow\nA peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important\nMy mind is really distorted\nI find nothing but trouble in my life\nI'm fortunate you believe in a dream\nThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands\nMy plan's rather vindictive\nEverybody's a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back, whispering \"Get 'em!\"\nI got 'em and I ain't give a fuck\nThat same mentality I told my brother not to duck\nIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors\nI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover\nThe life that I knew as a youngin\nIn pajamas and dun-ta-duns\nWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb\nNiggas like me never prosper\nPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted\nThis Piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever\nAnd I love you 'cause you love my brother like you

hearin' about it\nBut doubted your ignorance\nHow could you ever just put her on blast and shit?\nJudgin' her past and shit?\nWell, it's completely my future\nHer nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit\nAnd I'ma need that forty dollars\nEven if I got to fuck, suck and swallow\nIn the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed\nBy a married man, and father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys\nMatter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's\nHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last week\nThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em\nSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em\nBack to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman\nOr better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'\nThen you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught\nThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I'm exhausted, but fuck that \"Sorry for your loss\" shit\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain\nIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in?\nI'll wait\u2026 Your rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song\n'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own\nAnd matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight\nI'll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate\nAnd I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'\nI'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'\nYou lyin' to these motherfuckers\nTalkin' about you can help 'em with my story\nYou can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...\n[Chorus]\nWhen the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main

me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Verse 3]\nSometimes I look in the mirror\nAnd ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?\nIf it's today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about, \u2019cause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest\nAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak on somethin'\nThat's realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"It need to be told\"\nCursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'\nOr steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's\nI count lives, all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong\nFightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me

Did I put enough work in?\n\n[Chorus]\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Outro]\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\n[Part II: \"I'm Dying of Thirst\"]\n\n[Skit]\n(On the phone)\n\"Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?\"\n\"Nigga, the homie's brother\u2014nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!\"\n\"Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.\"\n\"We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we\u2014nigga, we right here, my nigga.\"\n\"Bring a nigga back a black!\"\n\"Nigga\u2014bruh\u2014nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga.

children, listen, it gets deep\nSee, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects\nThe object was to process and digest poverty's dialect\nAdaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot\nFederal policies raid buildings and drug professionals\nAnthony was the oldest of seven\nWell-respected, calm and collected\nLaughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack\nA four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her\nHis family history: pimpin' and bangin'\nHe was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'\nFifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces\nEven got some head from a smoker last weekend\nDodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie\nSmall-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him\nTen-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily\nSeen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies\nHad a couple of shooters, caught a murder case\nFingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it\nThat was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin\nHe beat the case and went back to hustlin'\nBird-shufflin', Anthony rang\nThe first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots\nAnd hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks\nCrooked cops told Anthony he should kick it\nHe brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken\nSee, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot\nWith a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window\nHis name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes\nSouthside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome\nDrove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars\nThey had a son, hopin' that he'd see college\nHustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it\nCadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends\nThree-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket\n'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it\nStuck up the place before, back in '84\nThat's when affiliation was really at gears of war\nSo many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime\nIntelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's\nDucky was well-aware\nThey robbed the manager and shot a customer last year\nHe figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides\nFree chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits\nAnthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him\nIn fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention\nThat one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time\nReverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why\nYou take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments\nGive 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it\nTwenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again\nInside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits\nThen you start remindin' them about that chicken incident\nWhoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?\nBecause if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life\nWhile I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight\n*Gunshot*\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $141You might also like[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]\nThgifnug a ni eid dna rehtaf a tuohtiw pu werg I elihW\nEfil 'nivres eb dluoc gwaD poT ,ykcuD dellik ynohtnA fi esuaceB\nEcnedicnioc morf eb dluow reppar tsetaerg eht thguoht reveohW?\nTnedicni nekcihc taht tuoba meht 'nidnimer trats uoy nehT\nStifeneb rieht 'nipaer yeht erehw soiduts gnidrocer edisnI\nNiaga teem me' ekam uoy ,sregnarts emas meht ,retal sraey ytnewT\nTi htiw evil dna seciohc nwo rieht ekam nac yeht os luos a me' eviG\nStnemaciderp modnar ni me' tup dna sregnarts owt ekat uoY\nYhw uoy llet ll'I dna ,amrak doog dna tsefinam eht esreveR\nEmit a ta esruc eno ,sevil yeht fo htob degnahc noisiced eno tahT\nNoitnetta yaP\u2014\nErac tuB\n\u2014Tpecnoc etalucammi ,siht ekil eno ecnis retrauq eniacoC\nAND ym edisni ytlayor tog ,ytlayoL\n\u2014Tog I ,tog I ,tog I ,tog I\nSo, I was takin' a walk the other day\u2026208Embed"}, {"name": "Location", "artist": "Playboi Carti", "lyrics": "TranslationsEspa\u00f1ol\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439Fran\u00e7aisLocation Lyrics[Intro: Playboi Carti & Fanesha Fabre]\n(La m\u00fasica de Harry Fraud)\nYeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, what?

I'm African, I'm black as the moon\nHeritage of a small village, pardon my residence\nCame from the bottom of mankind\nMy hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide\nYou hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture\nYou're fuckin' evil\nI want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey\nYou vandalize my perception but can't take style from me\nAnd this is more than confession\nI mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion\nI'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it\nYou sabotage my community, makin' a killin'\nYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the

ya\nGonna love ya like a black widow, baby\n\n[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]\nThis twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same\nFirst we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray\nWe went from nothin' to something, liking to lovin'\nIt was us against the world, and now we just fucking?\nIt's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you\nFeelin' stupid for all the time that I gave you\nI wanted all or nothin' for us, ain't no place in between\nMight, might be me believin' what you say that you'll never mean\nLike it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long\nIf it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singin' this song\nYou were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored\nAnd as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing\n[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & Iggy Azalea]\nYou used to be thirsty for me\nBut now you wanna be set free\nThis is the web, web that you weave\nSo baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)\n[Chorus: Rita Ora & Iggy

l-l-l-love you until it hurts\nJust to get you, I'm doin' whatever works\nYou ain't ever met nobody that will do ya how I do ya\nThat'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah\nI'ma make you beg for it, plead for it\n'Til you feel like you breathe for it\n'Til you'll do any and everything for it\nI want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it\n'Til it's got you gaspin' for air and you lean forward\n'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind\nAnd it's nothin' but me, on it (On it, on it)\nNow it's me time, believe that\nIf it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise

1]\nIt's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend\nThe one you let hit it and never called you again\n'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?\nYou act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim\nTo begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend\nLike you wasn't down and you called him again?\nPlus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him\nIf you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again\nTalking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian\nA Muslim, sleeping with the jinn\nNow that was the sin that did Jezebel in\nWho you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?\nShowing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend\nGirlfriend, let me break it down for you again\nYou know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine\nDon't be a hard rock when you really are a gem\nBaby girl, respect is just a minimum\nNiggas fucked up and you still defending 'em\nNow, Lauryn is only human\nDon't think I haven't been through the same predicament\nLet

pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men\nNeed to take care of they three or four kids\nAnd they face a court case when the child support late\nMoney taking and heart breaking, now you wonder

Ha ha ha! We love you\nHow many people are proud to be citizens\nOf this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars\nFor the rights that men have died for to protect?\nThe women and men who have broke their necks\nFor the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold\u2026\u00a0or so we're told\n(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see\nSo many motherfuckin' people who feel like me\nWho share the same views and the same exact beliefs\nIt's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me\nSo many lives I touched, so much anger aimed\nIn no particular direction, just sprays and sprays\nAnd straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays\n'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days\nWho would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair\nWith some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear\nThat I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?\nHow could I predict my words would have an impact like this?\nI must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office\n'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems\nAnd now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government\nI'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on\n[Chorus]\nWhite America!

Erica loves my shit\nI go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself\nIf they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf\nBut Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help\nMake ladies swoon, baby (Ooh, baby!) \u2014 Look at my sales!\nLet's do the math: If I was black, I would've sold half\nI ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that\nBut I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back\nGive me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at\nWhen I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white\nNo labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like\n\"Fuck it,\" until I met Dre, the only one to look past\nGave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass\nHelped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got\nWas prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got\nLike damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow\nI'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now?

fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nSearchin' for resolutions until somebody get back\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nWonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap\nDamn\n\n[Bridge 2: B\u0113kon]\nGod damn you, God damn me\nGod damn us, God damn we\nGod damn us all\n\n[Outro: Carl Duckworth]\nVerse 2 says, \"You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities\"\nSo until we come back to these commandments\nUntil you come back to these commandments\nWe gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse\nBecause He said He's gonna punish us\nThe so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians\nAre the true children of Israel\nWe are the Israelites, according to the Bible\nThe children of Israel\nHe's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience\nBecause we chose to follow other gods\nThat man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee\nSo, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you\nBecause He loves you, so that's why we get chastised\nThat's why we're in the position that we're in\nUntil we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments\nAnd do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us\nWe gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live\nHere, in today, in the United States of America\nI love you, family, and I pray for you\nGod bless you\nShalom174Embed"}, {"name": "Pity Party", "artist": "Melanie Martinez", "lyrics": "TranslationsFran\u00e7aisDanskPity Party Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDid my invitations disappear?\nWhy'd I put my heart on

a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead\nIn this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to\nBeing a leader in this day and age is being a threat\nNot many people stood up against the system we all call life\nBut toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice\nA voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time\nA voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest\nThis is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too\nThis is the story of the Man on the MoonYou might also like26Embed"}, {"name": "Drip Too Hard (Lil Baby & Gunna)", "artist": "Lil Baby", "lyrics": "TranslationsT\u00fcrk\u00e7eDanskDrip

this\nQueen, I ain't seen you in a minute\nWrote this letter, and finally decide to send it\nSigned, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together\nLove has no limit, let's spend it slow forever\nI know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you\nI ain't gon' assault them, \u2018cause I probably did it too\nBecause of you, feelings I handle with care\nSome niggas recognize the light, but they can't handle the glare\nYou know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts\nIf relationship is effort, I will match your work\nI want to be the one to make you happiest and hurt you the most\nThey say the end is near, it's important that we close.. to the Most High\nRegardless of what happen, on Him let's rely\n[Hook]\nThere are times\nWhen you'll need someone\nI will be by your side\nThere is a light that shines\nSpecial for you and me\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's important we communicate\nAnd tune the fate of this union to the right pitch\nI never call you my bitch, or even my boo\nThere's so much in a name, and so much more in you\nFew understand the union of woman and man\nAnd sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land\nBut that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write\nFor in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light\nIf Heaven had a height, you would be that tall\nGhetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all\nLet's stick to understandin' and we won't fall\nFor better or worse times, I hope to me you call\nSo I pray every day more than anythin'\nFriends we'll stay as we begin to lay\nThis foundation for a family, love ain't simple\nWhy can't it be anythin' worth havin' you work at annually?\nGranted we known each other for some time\nIt don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine\nYou might also like[Hook]\nThere are times\nWhen you'll need

to\nMy heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness\nTruthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence\nThe time we committed love, it was real good\nHad to be for me to arrive and it still feel good\nI know the sex ain't gon' keep you\nBut as my equal, it's how I must treat you\nAs my reflection in light I'ma lead you\nAnd whatever's right I'ma feed you\nDigga-da, digga-da,

me\nIndigenous African only spoke Zulu\nMy American tongue was leery\nWalked out the gas station\nA homeless man with a semi-tan complexion\nAsked me for ten Rand, stressin' about dry land\nDeep water, powder blue skies that crack open\nA piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'\nHe begged and pleaded\nAsked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it\nTold him, \"Beat it\"\nContributin' money just for his pipe\u2014I couldn't see it\nHe said, \"My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated\nListen to me, I want a single bill from you\nNothin' less, nothin'

leave\nAnd somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see\nThe reason why he was mad at a stranger\nLike I was supposed to save him\nLike I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor\nHe's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser\nHe's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious\n'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect\nIf I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck\nI never understood someone beggin' for goods\nAskin' for handouts, takin' it if they could\nAnd this particular person just had it down pat\nStarin' at me for the longest until he finally asked\n\"Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?\nA humble man is all that we ever need\"\nTell me, how much a dollar cost?\n[Chorus: James

I can't say no to nobody\nAnd at this rate, we gon' both die broke\nGot friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt\nAnd like my wife said, I still didn't say no\nPeople tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter\nMy friends' best advice was to stay low\nI guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills\nEspecially when you got family members on payroll\nThe media said it was outlandish spendin'\nThe media said he's way out of control\nI just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'\nI'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control\nI know I'm the most influential\nThat TIME cover was just confirmation\nThis generation's closest thing to Einstein\nSo don't worry about me, I'm fine\nI can see a thousand years from now in real life\nSkate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like\nTroll conventional thought, don't need to question\nI know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive\nThank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission\nDid it with no permission, on our own conditions\nMost blacks with money have been beaten to submission\nYeezy with the big house, did it way different\nNever listen to Hollywood producers\nDon't stare at money too long, it's Medusa\nThe ultimate Gemini has survived\nI wasn't supposed to make it past 25\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're

believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro\nIf the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho\nBrother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation\nHe sat back and smiled\nBlack on black lies is worse than black on black crime\nThe Jews share their truth on how to make a dime\nMost black men couldn't balance a checkbook\nBut buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, \"How my neck look?\"\nWell, it all looks great\nFour hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains\nThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard\nReal family stick together and see through the mirage\nThe smokescreens, perceptions of false reality\nWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?\nI am one with the people\nI am one with the people (Real!)\nI've been woken from enlightened man's dream\nCheckin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem\nLet me not say too much or do too much\n'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch\nI'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen\nSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'\nGod, I have humbled myself before the court\nDrop my ego when confidence was my last resort\nI know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I turned on the news and they was buryin' me\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me\nTold Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see\nI would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov\nI heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove\nBut it's better that I stayed at home with my folks\n'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke\nOnly thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go\nWe all go\nNot just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's

on a Saturday, knew it was somethin' soon as you spoke it\nEye fuckin' across the table, don't think anybody noticed\nYou asked me if I was comin' to city you from\nMaybe we should kick it, I was interested, that would be dumb\nIf I denied long legs, good ears, great taste\nSmell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face\nAnd we clicked, we was at each other's hips\nI ain't even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough\nYou and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly\nWe was chattin' 'til mornin', the vibrations was heavy\nI wasn't drownin' or yawnin', that's when I told you my feelings\nYou told me you felt the same, but you got homie you dealin' with\nDamn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected\nBut I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it\nWe still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it\nThe problem is he my friend, but if I'm honest, I'm really hopin' you drop him\nIt's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross\nBut you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost\nI try to keep it together, never felt this way\nWe spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day\nAnd they say, \"Bros over hoes,\" I'm like, \"Mm, nah, hey\"\nI would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake\nBut whatever, we still could be friends, it could still be chance\nI'ma play it cool, we got somethin', we cannot pretend, uh, uh\n[Interlude]\nIt's, it's like starting a race\nAnd then when you take off, they like, \"No, no, it's not a end,\" ha\nIt was too late and shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nFaceTimin', it ain't 'bout nothin', you laughin', packin' your luggage\nIt's nothin' incriminatin', but please delete our discussions\nYou hit me with the look and replied like, \"Duh, bitch\"\nDon't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back\nCross the line, cross the line, cross the\u2014 nah, we never did that\nThough I haven't seen him in months, shit is rare he never hit back\nAnyway, convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it\nRight in front of his lenses, nothing here is malicious\nYou sat by me in that movie, we went outside for them doobies\nWe walkin' off when we talk, man, that nigga not fuckin' stupid\nHe see it, he know it's somethin' we frontin' like, \"Ha-ha-ha\"\nWhenever we \"Ha-ha-ha,\" we subtly press his buttons\nNot on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose\nIf I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it\nBut, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it\nAnd plus y'all got depth, I'm just the nigga on the surface, for real\nSurface\n\n[Interlude]\nI said surface, like, 'cause they got roots\nLike, I'm the new nigga\nBut you know, they be fuckin', haha\nYeah, yeah\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nDidn't see you a couple weeks, think he want you away from me\nKnow y'all argued 'bout if you mad you met him before you met me\nI feel guilty, but not as much as I should\nI tried to have that self-control, but not as much as I could\nI been down for days, you in my city and I can't see your face\nI can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place\nI never been jealous of another man\nEspecially when I have everything I want at hand\nExcept you, you\n\n[Interlude]\nYou know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs\nBut it's like, \"No, I want that,\" ha\n\n[Verse 4]\nHe left for some days, I cleared out my sched', I cleared out my head\nYou dropped off at mine, I say that we fled, \"No, you pick a place\"\nWe could Tulum, or we could Capri, or die right here\nAs long as you with me, I'll be at peace, huh\nYou was supposed to go back home to see your bestie\nI told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week\nYou was like, \"Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that\"\nSeven days with me, your nigga like, \"Where the fuck you at?\"\nDirtyin' my bakin' pots, tennis at my mama spot\nChauffeured in the Rolls, the back entrance for them restaurants\nParks playin' chess games, givin' wigs pet names\nManicures, night swims, Jerrod providin' methane\nShoppin' 'til we droppin', what you coppin'?\nSee, the price is not a option\nIt's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me\nI know around him, you gotta act like you not into me\nI know your answer, but you gotta keep it honest with me\nSaid you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him\nThen why the fuck when we link it's like he doesn't exist?\nThey all know that we friends, but we both aware that it's more\nEverything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours\nThe only thing I'm missin' in life, I know you could be it\nAnd everyone around me that care about me can see it\nI could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in\nMen or women, it don't matter, if I seen 'em, then I had 'em\nBut with you, it's a feeling 'cause we twinnin' and we matchin'\nYou stayed in the car when I went on date with that actress\nWhole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back\nIn the back of the car with you and talk about who we are\nYou told me when you with me, it's like heroin\nTold me that your confidence went up since we befriended, and\nTold me that you didn't wanna hurt him, why we doin' this?\nTold me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it\nTold me every time you not with him, it started problems, and\nTold me every time you not with me, you always ponder\nWhat type of sweater I'm wearin', what music have I been finding\nGirl, you know that I'ma play it whenever, that's what we bonded over\nYou said you told him the truth and you never lied\nNow he lookin' at you with them eyes\nWe never crossed the line, but he got every right to be a lil' pissed off\nHe picked you up, y'all got an argument, he got his shit off\nMy energy like, \"Get lost,\" your energy just want peace\nI couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak\nHe ain't even call you his bitch\nUntil he see me make you smile, that nigga threatened as shit\nI'm in the wrong, though\nI picked you up, your energy off\nYour lips really dry, something is off\nYou ask if I gotta, I ask if you gotta\nWe trip on our words, nobody is lyin', hakuna matata\nWe sat in the car and cried for a hour\nMy shirt look like a showerhead got it, we called it off\nI'll skip the details but that night I seen hell\nYou was in a room I was payin' for, I took three Ls\nNo, I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell\nThey buckled to the ground, I cannot walk, shit, I need Vill\nNext day I'm drivin' 'round the city with no destination back-up\nWater in my eyes kept falling like Niagara\nVill right beside me makin' sure I didn't crash or\nDo something heinous 'cause I'm emotionally jabbed up\nYou checked every box, I thought it was it\nFelt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff\nNo, I'm in the wrong, that was a friend\nNo, fuck that, the energy we had, never again will find it\nYou in the wrong, gotta remind you 'bout the times that you stepped\nGotta rewind it\u2014 aw, fuck\nWe talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links\nYou don't do that type of shit when you in relationship\nAnd you a hundred with your mate, so don't go actin' like no saint\n'Cause it's a two-way street, and shit, you knew what I was on\nAnd while that nigga out and gone, shit, you was loungin' in my home\nShit, I even let you meet my mama and y'all got along\nBut shit, I'll take my L, though it's not fun\nYou still got your nigga and still had your fun\nShit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words\nThat's why I called and said we couldn't end this on bad terms\nWe straight like a bad perm, we'll always be good friends\nAnd laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns, huh\nThis my perspective, this how I feel\nI ain't fabricate nothin', I kept it real\nI told you I love you and always will\nAnd if he ever put his hands on you, promise I'll get him killed, true\nTrue, true, true, yeah\n[Outro]\nOn God, I love that girl, f\u2014 mhm\nI'm a sh\u2014 I'm a bad person, like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person\nI had no ill intentions, though\nShit, everybody got hurt\nI got hurt, bruh\nIt's a shit situation\nAll the morals and power you have just vanish when a certain energy is nearing\nAnd those feelings got so much gravity and it's out of your control\nThat made me realize adults don't know what they doin' either\nWe're all just children\nI ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up, man\nI thought I was bulletproof\nShe proved me wrong, man\nI felt two hundred percent with her\nIt was beautiful\nI was able to feel\nBut it was, it was bad timing\nAnd I'm mad private with this side of my life 'cause people are weirdos, and\nI just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows\nSafe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts\n'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of

afraid\u205fto\u205fsay\u205fthey need some\u205ftime\nThe turnaround is\u205flife or death, but you don't mind\nGo out the way to say you made the compromise\nThat's what I call love\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut the time it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you\nYou say no and all you've done gives them amnesia\nOne thing I've learned, love can change with th\u0435 seasons\n[Chorus]\nAnd I can't please \u0435verybody\nNo, I can't please everybody\nWait, you can't please everybody\nNo, I can't please everybody\nI can't please everybody\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey idolize and praise your name across the nation\nTap the feet and nod the head for confirmation\nPromise that you keep the music in rotation\nThat's what I call love (That's what I call love)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut the time it'll come (But the time it'll come)\nTo not be there when somebody needs you (When somebody needs you)\nYou say no and all you've done gives them amnesia (They don't remember)\nOne thing I've learned, love can change with the seasons\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I can't please everybody\nNo, I can't please everybody\nWait, you can't please everybody\nNo, I can't please

ways...\"\n[Verse 1: MF DOOM]\nWreak havoc, beep beep it's mad traffic\nSleek and lavish people speak and leak it to the maverick\nHe see as just another felony drug arrest\nAny day could be the one he pick the wrong thug to test\nSlug through the vest, shot in the street\nFor pulling heat on a father whose baby's gotta eat\nAnd when they get hungry, it ain't shit funny\nPaid to interfere with how a brother get his money\nNow, who's the real thugs, killers and gangsters?\nSet the revolution, let the things bust and thank us\nWhen the smoke clear, you can see the sky again\nThere will be the chopped off heads of Leviathan\n[Interlude: Sample and MF DOOM]\nMy friend, they call 'em strangers\nAnybody talk to him end up in some danger\n\"They'll never change...\nThey stay...\nStrange ways...\"\nCan't reform 'em\n[Verse 2: MF DOOM]\nThey pray four times a day, they pray five\nWho ways is strange when it's time to survive\nSome will go of they own free will to die\nOthers take them with you when they blow sky high\nWhat's the difference? All you get is lost children\nWhile the bosses sit up behind the desks, it cost billions\nTo blast humans in half, into calves and arms\nOnly one side is allowed to have bombs\nIt's like making a soldier drop his weapon\nShooting him, and telling him to get to stepping\nObviously, they came to portion up his fortune\nSounds to me like that old robbery/extortion\n\n[Interlude: Sample and MF DOOM]\n\"They'll never change...\nThey stay...\"\nSame Game\n\"Strange ways...\"\nYa can't reform 'em\nYou might also like[Outro: Sample]\n...that Mary was goin' around with an old flame\nThat burned me up, because I know he was just feeding her a line!\nBut the guy really spent his money like water\nI think he was connected, so I left\nOutside it was raining cats and dogs\nI was feelin' mighty blue... and everything looked black\nBut I carried on!33Embed"}, {"name": "Hey Ya! - Radio Mix / Club Mix", "artist": "OutKast", "lyrics": "Hip-Hop\u2019s Greatest Singles By Year Lyrics1979\n1.

little older, I realize life is perspective\nAnd my perspective may differ from yours\nI wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me\nAll my fans, all\u205fmy\u205fbeautiful\u205ffans\nAnyone who's ever\u205fgave me a\u205flisten, all my people\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nI come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor\nRebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer\nBelt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence\nMake the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment\nResidue burned, mist of the inner-city\nMiscommunication to keep homi' detective busy\nNo protection is risky\nDesensitized, I vandalized pain, covered up and camouflaged\nGet used to hearin' arsenal rain\nAnalyze, risk your life, take the charge\nHomies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard\nThat's culture\nTwenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called\nSaid your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved\nI done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house\nGet out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed\nCar wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed\nA brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams\nThe culture\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar with Marvin Gaye]\n(I want, I want, I want, I want)\nBut I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood\nLook what I done for you (Look what I done for you)\nLook what I done for you\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nI said I do this for my culture\nTo let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover\nIn my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper\nHair trigger, walk up closer, ain't no Photoshoppin'\nFriends bipolar, grab you by your pockets\nNo option if you froze up, always play the offense\nNiggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work\nWorkin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork\nThat's the culture, point the finger, promote ya\nRemote location, witness protection, they gon' hold ya\nThe streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me\nI wanna represent for us\nNew revolution was up and movin'\nI'm in Argentina wiping my tears, full of confusion\nWater in between us, another peer's been executed\nHistory repeats again\nMake amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it\nBut that's the culture, crack a bottle\nHard to deal with the pain when you're sober\nBy tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over\nThat's the problem\nOur foundation was trained to accept whatever follows\nDehumanized, insensitive\nScrutinize the way we live for you and I\nEnemies shook my hand, I can promise I'll meet you\nIn the land where no equal is your equal\nNever say I ain't told ya, nah\nIn the land where hurt people hurt more people\nFuck callin' it culture\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $141You might also like[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar with Marvin Gaye]\n(I want, I

purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now\nSacrifice personal gain over everything\nJust to see the next generation better than ours\nI wasn't perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered\nTemptation, impatience, everything that the body nurtures\nI felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry\nBut all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent\nFace your fears, always knew that I would make it here\nWhere the energy is magnified and persevered\nConsciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear\nEuphoria is glorified and made His\nReflectin' on my life and what I done\nPaid dues, made rules, change outta love\nThem same views made schools change curriculums\nBut didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun\nShould I feel resentful I didn't see my full potential?\nShould I feel regret about the good that I was into?\nEverything is everything, this ain't coincidental\nI woke up that morning with more heart to give you\nAs I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence\nTo my brother, to my kids, I'm in Heaven\nTo my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven\nTo my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven\nTo my friends, make sure you countin' them blessings\nTo my fans, make sure you make them investments\nAnd to the killer that sped up my demise\nI forgive you, just know your soul's in question\nI seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed\nAnd though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved\nI completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave\nBut fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased\nI can't stress how I love y'all\nI don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all\nThe memories recollect just because y'all\nCelebrate me with respect\nThe unity we protect is above all\nAnd Sam, I'll be watchin' over you\nMake sure my kids watch all my interviews\nMake sure you live out our dreams we produced\nKeep that genius in your brain on the move\nAnd to my neighborhood, let the good prevail\nMake sure them babies and the leaders outta jail\nLook for salvation when troubles get real\n'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself\nAnd I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed\nY'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel\nAnd though my physical won't reap the benefits\nThe energy that carry on emits still\nI want you200Embed"}, {"name": "Sunshine", "artist": "Lupe Fiasco",

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\n\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"\n\n[Saxophone Solo]\n\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\n\n[Hiphop: \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\"]\n\nI'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"\n\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\n[JAY-Z: \"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"]\nAnd he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\n[JAY-Z: \"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"]\n\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"So what you think of this?\"]\n\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n\n[Donda West: \"Come on, let's just go\"]\n\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n\n[Donda West: \"Kanye, baby, we're here\"]\n\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\n[Hiphop: \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"]\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\n[Dame: \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"]\n\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\n[Dame: \"Jay got classics, G.\"]\n\nYou know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\n\n[JAY-Z: \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"]\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them \"Jesus Walks\" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\n[Jessica: \"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"]\n\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\n\n[\"Y'all niggas is stupid\"]\n\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\n\n[Joe: \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"]\n\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\n[Dame: \"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"]\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\n[Dame: \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"]\n\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\n[Dame: \"it's actually kinda hot.\"]\n\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know.

plays in ways the mind can't figure out\nHeart plays in ways the mind can't\u2014\nHeart plays in ways the mind can't figure out\nThis is how we conceptualize human beings\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nMy auntie is a man now\nI think I'm old enough to understand now\nDrinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards\nMotorola pager, off-white Guess jacket\nBlue Air Max's, gold chains, and curl kits\n'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest\nBig social, big personality, vocal\nPlayed the underground verbatim and stayed local\nMy auntie is a man now\nI watch him and his girl hold their hands down\nTip of the avenues under street lights made his\nThinking, \"I want me a bad bitch when I get big\"\nThey hug on the corner like California king\nCold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road\nSee, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado\nScratching the likes from lotto\nHoping that she pull up tomorrow\nSo I can hang out in the front seat\nSix by nines keeping the music up under me\nMy auntie is a man now\nAsked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much\nAnd at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much\nShe said, \"Ain't no tellin'\nNiggas always been jealous because he had more women\nMore money and more attention made more envy\nCalling him anything but broke was less offending\"\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nMy auntie is a man now\nI think I'm old enough to understand now\nDrinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards\nBack when it was comedic relief to say, \"Faggot\"\nFaggot, faggot, faggot, we ain't know no better\nElementary kids with no filter, however\nMy auntie became a man and I took pride in it\nShe wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference\nThat's what I told my friends in second grade\nShe picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face\nThey couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed\nWe pull off bumpin' Quik like it was nothing\nMy auntie is a man now, what a relationship\nI grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit\nHe gave me some cash then gave me some game\nCherry freshener on the dash, I never complained\nShe even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade\nThe first person I seen write a rap\nThat's when my life had changed\nHouse full of demo, smoke stuck on the window\nCameras on the microphone, all women and men though\nMy auntie was a man now, we cool with it\nThe history had trickled down and made us ign'ant\nMy favorite cousin said he's returning the favor\nAnd following my auntie with the same behavior\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $141You might also

talk for a while, he seemed more distant\nWasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive\nBut I recall we both had a sick sense of humor\nMade raw, but time changes all\n\n[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nRemember church, Easter Sunday?\nI sat in the pew, you had stronger faith\nMore spiritual when these dudes were living life straight\nWhich I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same\nHe said my cousin was going through some things\nHe promised the world we living in was an act on abomination\nAnd Demetrius was to blame\nI knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman\nWondering if God still call you a decent man\nStill you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint\nUntil he singled you out to prove his point, saying\n\"Demetrius is Mary-Ann now\nChurch, his auntie is a man now,\" it hurt\nYou the most 'cause your belief was close to his words\nForcing me to stand now\nI said, \"Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?\nThe laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?\nI recognize the study she was taught since birth\nBut that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved\"\nThe building was thinking out loud, bad angel\nThat's when you looked at me and smiled, said, \"Thank you\"\nThe day I chose humanity over religion\nThe family got closer, it was all forgiven\nI said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better\nMistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different\nSee, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound\nIf ever they was pronounced without any intentions\nThe very second you challenged the shit I was kicking\nReminded me about a show I did out the city\nThat time I brung a fan on stage to rap\nBut disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me\nYou said, \"Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction\nTo truly understand love, switch position\n'Faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together\nBut only if you let a white girl say 'Nigga'\"47Embed"},

Whether your earliest musical memories are of The Beatles professing that they love you yeah yeah yeah, your grammar school classmates singing along with Thriller, or Jay Z rapping about his hard knock life, the tunes you hear in your formative years pave the way for what\u2019s to come.\n\nSo it is with hip-hop.  The musical backbone of rap\u2019s most influential era -- the so-called Golden Age of the late 1980s to early 90s -- has its roots in the childhood memories of its creators.  Songs heard in parents\u2019 dens or at dances got chopped up, dissected, and scientifically rearranged.\n\nA few seconds of solo drums in the middle of a song would become the basis for a whole new creation.  A guitar stab, grunt, or horn riff took on new life as the canvas for an emcee or group to paint on.  And anything was fair game.  Cheesy pop songs, novelties, movie soundtracks -- as long as it was funky, it made the cut.  It was all about the breaks.\n\nAt the very beginning of hip-hop culture, there was the break.  A DJ named Clyde Campbell working parties in the Bronx in the early 1970s discovered that people loved the moments in songs where everything would drop out except the drums, or occasionally the drums and bass.  But these instrumental sections were almost always short -- a few seconds or a minute.  How to keep the party going?\n\nCampbell, who was dj\u2019ing under the name \u201cKool Herc,\u201d invented a technique he called \u201cthe Merry-Go-Round.\u201d  It involved finding those key moments in each record, and going right from one to the other.  He\u2019d start with James Brown\u2019s \u201cGive It Up or Turn It Loose,\u201d a favorite among b-boys to this day (it\u2019s the one old-schoolers call \u201cClap your hands, stomp your feet,\u201d after Brown\u2019s exhortation at the beginning of the break).  Then he\u2019d transition into \u201cBongo Rock\u201d from the Incredible Bongo Band, and go right into Babe Ruth\u2019s \u201cThe Mexican.\u201d  Or, even better, he\u2019d take two copies of the same record and switch back and forth, extending a single break into infinity.  The dancers loved it -- all of their favorite moments that they\u2019d previously had to wait for, now happening one after another, in an endless wave of funky drums.\n\nBy the time rap music made it to record in 1979, the concept of extending a single breakbeat was transferred onto the new genre.  The early records featured popular songs of the era either sampled or replayed, with grooves that had once rocked the dance floor now expected to rock the pockets of record buyers.\nFamiliarity may breed contempt, but to early hip hop record makers, it also bred success.  Chic\u2019s monster hit \u201cGood Times,\u201d released that very year, formed the basis for dozens of early rap songs, including the biggest one of all, \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d by the Sugarhill Gang. Cheryl Lynn\u2019s \u201cGot to be Real\u201d from the previous year was another one whose groove was used over and over.\n\nBut the breaks used at the earliest parties showed up as well.  As the genre grew and more records started being made, the tunes that folks remembered from the parties they had attended as kids ten or so years prior began showing up in their raps.  By the mid-1980s, records like The Incredible Bongo Band\u2019s \u201cApache,\u201d the Honeydrippers\u2019 \u201cImpeach the President,\u201d or any number of James Brown cuts began appearing in earnest as the backing to rap records.\n\nAnd then 1986 hit, and nothing was the same.  Two enigmatic figures known as \u201cBreakbeat Lou\u201d and \u201cBreakbeat Lenny\u201d put out the first volume of an anthology that would shake up the world and change the sound of rap forever.  Louie Flores and Lenny Roberts released the first of what would become 25 volumes of a series called Ultimate Breaks and Beats.\n\nThese were wide-ranging, extremely illegal compilations that included songs favored by DJs for their breaks.  The first volume contained tunes ranging from The Monkees\u2019 \u201cMary Mary\u201d to Rufus Thomas\u2019 novelty \u201cDo the Funky Penguin.\u201d  But it was the third song, \u201cAmen Brother\u201d by The Winstons, that would push the project over the edge.  The drum solo in that tune became so popular that it eventually got its own name -- the \u201c\u2018Amen\u2019 break.\u201d  It showed up in NWA (\u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d), Salt-N-Pepa (\u201cI Desire\u201d), the Ultramagnetic MCs (\u201cCritical Beatdown\u201d), and countless other dope late-80s tracks.  It also took on a second life in the 90s, as it appeared in sped-up form in nearly every drum-n-bass song of the era.\n\nMore than any individual tune, though, it was the idea of having all of the hottest breaks in one easy-to-find place that made the series take off.  Until the series stopped in 1991, the tunes on UBB became the backbone of the genre.  The songs on the 25 volumes ranged from 1966 to 1984, with the vast majority unsurprisingly dating from the 70s, the same era as the parties where breakbeats first ruled.  Every producer of the era, whether they copped to it or not, used breaks found somewhere on the compilations.  They defined the sound of the era.\n\nThe series ceased right around the time sampling laws tightened up, and using breaks became considerably more expensive.  The classic breaks are now far too identifiable, so current producers engage in a cat-and-mouse game of finding more and more obscure breaks, or trying to alter them enough to be unrecognizable.\n\nLuckily for the inquisitive listener of today, UBB was reissued (still illegally!) a few years ago as a set of 2 CDs containing all 25 volumes on MP3, so it\u2019s possible to find if you look hard enough.\n\nWhat Makes a Break?\n\u201cI\u2019m ripping emcees from \u2018Funky Drummer\u2019 to \u2018Big Beat\u2019\u201d\n-- LL Cool J, \u201cMurdergram\u201d\n\nSo why have some breaks been used over and over?  What makes a good break beat?  First off, from a producer\u2019s perspective, ease of use is important.  Having only the drums playing makes a breakbeat easy to sample and loop -- there are no difficult decisions on how to cut out the vocals or other instruments.\n\nIt is this simple qualification that many of rap\u2019s most sampled breaks have in common.  In 2010, the website Who Sampled put together a list of the most-sampled breaks of all time.  The vast majority of them -- eight out of ten -- were from between 1969 and 1973, with just one outlier on each end of that time period.  In almost all of them, there were between two and eight bars of solo drums.\n\nWhat does that mean to you as a listener?  First off, certain popular breaks have become a part of the language and meaning of rap songs.  When a contemporary song uses \u201cApache\u201d from the Incredible Bongo Band (from 1973, #6 on the list), it\u2019s used not only because it\u2019s a dope break.  The sample\u2019s existence is itself a reference to its popularity in early park jams, and also to the hundreds of times the beat has been sampled since 1981.  Jay Z and Kanye West used these associations astutely on the 2011 track \u201cThat\u2019s My Bitch.\u201d  The song foregrounded an \u201cApache\u201d sample, but also included an homage to Public Enemy and a lyrical shoutout to Golden Age rapper Monie Love.  All of these things worked in tandem to add an intended subtext of, as Digital Underground put it, \u201ca tribute to the early days.\u201d\n\nIn fact, as early as 1987, \u201cApache\u201d was used to signify those same early days.  A sample of the song was used on Kool Moe Dee\u2019s \u201cWay Way Back,\u201d on which he used a self-consciously dated style to pay tribute to his roots.  Likewise, Busy Bee used the \u201cApache\u201d break on his 1988 song \u201cOld School.\u201d  Immediately after the break plays, his first words are, \u201cOh man, that\u2019s that old school.\u201d  Without the knowledge of the break\u2019s history, that ad-lib would fall on deaf ears, and in fact the whole concept of the song would be nonsensical.\nThat same sample could also serve as a canvas for innovation.  Kool G. Rap used it for his 1989 tune \u201cMen At Work,\u201d  whose polysyllabic rhymes left a lifelong impression on a whole generation of emcees (to this day, Black Thought of The Roots can still rap the tune perfectly word-for-word).  The tune had all the more impact for including advanced lyricism against a familiar template, where listeners were used to hearing the simplistic end-line rhymes of The Sugarhill Gang or the schoolyard chants of Busy Bee.\n\nIn truth, a solid knowledge of the soul and funk of the late 1960s and 1970s is essential to really understanding hip-hop.  Being able to identify the bells on Bob James\u2019 classic \u201cTake Me to the Mardi Gras\u201d (1974) or the drums of Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cChocolate Buttermilk\u201d (1969) will add layers upon layers to your enjoyment of rap songs.\n\nCan\u2019t Stop the Rock: Rock & Roll and Other Outliers\n\u201cI\u2019m the King of Rock, there is none higher/Sucker emcees should call me \u2018Sire\u2019\u201d\n-- Run-DMC, \u201cKing of Rock\u201d\n\nOne of the oddities on Who Sampled\u2019s list provides another important clue to unlocking the mysteries of the break beat.  Number nine on the list is \u201cThe Big Beat,\u201d a 1980 track by hard rocker Billy Squier.  The song didn\u2019t chart, and would have been forgotten, despite its charming stop-motion-filled video , if not for rap.  Its opening drum break was immediately adopted by rappers -- by 1981, it was already a staple of many artists\u2019 live performances.\n\nSo what does this mean?  That rappers were anxiously awaiting Billy Squier\u2019s first solo album?  Of course not.  The break was adopted because it had open drums, was right at the beginning of the song, and sounded great.  That it was on a hard-rock record mattered not a bit.\n\nThis catholic approach to sampling has been true of hip-hop from the beginning, and continues to be so today.  Popular Golden Age breaks came from funk and soul records, to be sure.  But they also came from jazz, hard rock, and even The Monkees, the only-on-television 1960s \u201cband\u201d whose \u201cMary Mary\u201d was adopted by De La Soul, Run-DMC, J.J. Fad, and 2 Live Crew proteges Anquette.  If something sounded good, the source didn\u2019t matter.\n\nThis approach, of reshaping good bits no matter where they\u2019re from, goes back very far in hip-hop\u2019s DNA.  Afrika Bambaataa, one of the genre\u2019s foremost pioneers, was famous for it.  During hip-hop\u2019s early years, he would throw parties where he would play everything -- electronic music, video game soundtracks, calypso -- with an unerring ear for what would both surprise people and keep the party moving.  His record collection, which is now preserved at Cornell University, grew to over 40,000 strong, and he became known as the \u201cMaster of Records.\u201d  That same adventurousness is preserved even in today\u2019s big stars -- Jay Z\u2019s sample of Gonjasufi, Kanye West taking from 1970s Hungarian rockers Omega, and more.\n\nThe Godfather: James Brown and the Break Beat\n\u201cTell the truth, James Brown was old/\u2019Til Eric and Ra came out with \u2018I Got Soul\u2019\u201d\n-- Stetsasonic, \u2018Talkin All That Jazz\u2019\n\nNo discussion of break beats is complete without an examination of James Brown.  Tracks that he either performed on or produced have been sampled well over 5,000 times, making him by far the most-sampled artist of all time.\n\nWhy is that?  As with so many things in hip-hop, and in history generally, there is no one monolithic answer.  Brown\u2019s cultural impact was unparalleled during the 1960s and 70s -- remember that showing a concert of his on television in the wake of MLK\u2019s death was pretty much the only thing that kept the city of Boston from rioting.  His call to \u201csay it loud, I\u2019m black and I\u2019m proud\u201d and his self-reliant cry that \u201cI don\u2019t want nobody to get me nothing/Open up the door, I\u2019ll get it myself\u201d had a huge impact on black people (and also cost him a lot of his white audience).\nMusically, Brown more or less single-handedly invented the hard-edged funk that would come to dominate the 1970s.  He took the traditions of rhythm and blues music and stripped them down to almost nothing -- a few words (often made up on the spot), a groove, and often just a single chord.\n\nSomehow, the force of his personality -- and an unerring nose for finding great musicians -- made it all work, and songs like \u201cSuper Bad\u201d and \u201cGet Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\u201d created what we now think of as funk.\n\nJames\u2019 influence extended far beyond his own tunes.  The songs he co-wrote and produced for other members of his camp became classics as well.  Lyn Collins (\u201cThink (About It)\u201d) and Bobby Byrd (\u201cI Know You Got Soul\u201d) used Brown\u2019s band The J.B.\u2019s to produce great records in the vein of the master.  And The J.B.\u2019s themselves released a ton of instrumentals in the 1970s that stand alongside Brown\u2019s greatest work.  Even former members of Brown\u2019s band got in on the act.  The sibling team of William \u201cBootsy\u201d Collins on bass and Phelps \u201cCatfish\u201d Collins on guitar, who played with Brown briefly in 1970-1, became key members of the legendary Parliament-Funkadelic collective after leaving the group.\n\nWhat does this all have to do with breaks?  First off, James\u2019 early funk songs were repetitive grooves.  While played straight through by the musicians, their circular nature connects them to the four- and eight-bar loops of early rap.  Also, the extended length of many of the tunes meant that there were lots of moments without vocals for burgeoning producers to sample.  And then there were the drum breaks.\n\n\u201cFunky Drummer,\u201d number two on Who Sampled\u2019s list, is a prime example.  The song itself is a seven-minute mellow bit of funk that consists almost entirely of a one-bar vamp.  Brown emotes and plays some organ on top of the groove.\n\nThen, almost five minutes in, Brown starts giving the band instructions for an upcoming drum break.   \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do no soloing, brother.  Just keep what you got!\u201d he tells drummer Clyde Stubblefield.  And 45 seconds later, Stubblefield does just that.  Everyone drops out, and perhaps the most famous eight bars in the history of funk begins.\n\nThe beat -- a barrage of ghost notes, hi-hat openings and closings, and a tricky syncopated kick drum pattern -- would echo down through the decades.  Starting in the mid-1980s, the beat became a staple in hip-hop.  Other Brown songs would soon follow, creating renewed interest in the master\u2019s work.  While all eras of his career would be fair game for samplers, his \u201chard funk\u201d period that began with 1967\u2019s \u201cCold Sweat\u201d and continued through 1976 makes up the vast majority of the sampled tunes.\n\nThe funk and soul of the late 1960s and 1970s, Brown especially, is the DNA of hip-hop.  It worked its way into the genre\u2019s sound, its emcees rhythms, and even its lyrical preoccupations.  From Biggie\u2019s \u201cfunk flow to make your drawers drop slow\u201d to \u201cRedman on the funk train,\u201d the sound, feel, attitude, and cool of the funk pioneers has been a guiding light in the rap world.\n\nIn addition to Brown, his proteges in the Parliament-Funkadelic collective had a huge influence on the sound of West Coast rap in particular.  Dr. Dre\u2019s breakthrough 1992 solo album The Chronic, a record that came to define the so-called \u201cG-funk\u201d sound, featured ten different samples from either Parliament, Funkadelic, or the collective\u2019s leader George Clinton, where no other artist was sampled more than once.\n\nKool & the Gang, before having smash success with crossover hits like \u201cHollywood Swingin\u2019,\u201d released funky instrumental tracks that would later be raided by producers.  Their 1969 debut record would be used by pioneers like Eric B and Rakim, Stetsasonic, X-Clan, NWA, Special Ed, A Tribe Called Quest, and more.\n\nWhile breakbeats were originally used to keep the party going, they came to be much more than that.  They were a way for producers to use the music that was most familiar to them in order to create something exciting and new.  And later, they began to signify themselves -- that is, to represent all of the other times that particular break has been used.  That, ultimately, is the magic of breaks, and their ever-shifting meaning over time is as hip-hop as anything else about them.20Embed"}, {"name": "The Number Song", "artist": "DJ Shadow", "lyrics": "The Number Song LyricsOne, two, three, four, five\nBreakdown, baby\n\nCome on and get with it\nOne, two, three, four, hit it\nWhat is this?\nThis is the number song\nBut before I start, let's have the countdown\nOne, two, three, four\n\nListen to this, just listen to this\nJust listen to this, just listen to this\nJust listen to this, just listen to this\nJust listen to this, just listen to this\nJust listen to this, just listen to this\nJust listen to this, just listen to this\nWe want y'all to understand\nOne, two, three, and\n\nEight, seven, six, five\nFour, three, two\nCome on and get with it\nOne, two, three, hit it (Have to go)\n\nWho got the number?\nWho, who got the number?\nWho got the number?\nWho, who got the number?\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAlright\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI got the number\n\nWon't you please let me rock your mind?\nThe party, the party\nThe party's already started\nAnd it's about to end\nOne, two, three, four\nIt's Def\n\nOne, two, three, four, one, get with it\nGet with it\nGet, get\nGet with it\nYou might also likeTen, nine (Everybody, come on)\nEight (Come on, louder), seven (Louder)\nSix (Louder)Embed"}, {"name": "Coming Home", "artist": "Diddy - Dirty Money", "lyrics": "Coming Home Lyrics[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nI'm comin' home, I'm comin' home\nTell the world I'm comin' home\nLet the rain wash away\nAll the pain of yesterday\nI know my kingdom awaits\nAnd they've forgiven my mistakes\nI'm comin' home, I'm comin' home\nTell the world I'm comin'\n\n[Intro: Diddy]\nI'm back where I belong (Uh, yeah)\nI never felt so strong, ayy (Yeah, I'm back, baby)\nI'm feelin' like there's nothin' that I can't try (Uh, nothin')\nAnd if you with me put your hands high (Yeah, put your hands high)\nHigh, ayy (If you ever lost a life before, this one's for you)\nAnd if you with me put your hands high (And you, the dreams are for you rockin' with the best)\nHigh, ayy (And you, and you)\nI'll be home soon\n[Verse 1: Diddy]\nI hear the \"Tears of a Clown,\" uh, I hate that song\nI always feel like they're talkin' to me, when it comes on (Come on)\nAnother day, another dawn\nAnother Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone\nWhat am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on?\nIt's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean (Come on)\nWhat if my twins ask me why I ain't marry their mom?
