towards the Gare d'Orsay, M. Etienne Rambert looked at his watch and found, as he had anticipated, that he had a good quarter of an hour before the train that he intended to take was due to start. He called a porter, and gave him the heavy valise and the bundle of rugs that formed the whole of his hand baggage.\n\n\"Where is the office for forwarding luggage, my man?\" he enquired.\n\nThe porter led him through the famous panelled hall of the Gare d'Orsay, and M. Etienne Rambert satisfied himself that his trunks had been properly registered for Verri\u00e8res, the station at which he had to alight for the ch\u00e2teau of Beaulieu.\n\nStill attended by the porter, who had conceived a respectful admiration for him in consequence of the authoritative tone in which he demanded information from the various railway servants, and who scented a probable munificent tip, M. Etienne Rambert proceeded to the booking-office and took a first-class ticket. He spent a few minutes more at the book-stall where he selected an imposing collection of illustrated papers, and then, his final preparations completed, he turned once more to the porter.\n\n\"The Luchon train,\" he said; \"where is it?\" and as the man only made a vague gesture and growled something wholly indistinct, he added: \"Lead the way, and I will follow.\"\n\nIt was now just half-past eight, and the station showed all the animation inseparable from the departure of main-line trains. M. Etienne Rambert hurried onwards, and reaching the platform from which all the lines begin, was stayed by the porter who was laden with his baggage.\n\"You want the express, sir?\"\n\n\"No, the slow train, my man.\"\n\nThe porter showed some surprise, but made no remark.\n\n\"Do you like the front or the back of the train?\"\n\n\"The back by choice.\"\n\n\"First-class, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, first-class.\"\n\nThe porter, who had stopped a moment, picked up the heavy valise again.\n\n\"Then there isn't any choice. There are only two first-class carriages on the slow train, and they are both in the middle.\"\n\n\"They are corridor carriages, I suppose?\" said Etienne Rambert.\n\n\"Yes, sir; there are hardly any others on the main-line trains, especially first-class.\"\n\nIn the ever-increasing crowd Etienne Rambert had some difficulty in following the porter. The Gare d'Orsay has little or none of the attractiveness of the other stations, which cannot fail to have a certain fascination for any imaginative person, who thinks of the mystery attaching to all those iron rails reaching out into the distance of countries unknown to him. It is less noisy than the others also, for between Austerlitz and Orsay the traction is entirely electric. And further, there is no clearly defined separation between the main and the suburban lines.\n\nOn the right of the platform was the train which was to take Etienne Rambert beyond Brives to Verri\u00e8res, the slow train to Luchon; and on the left of the same platform was another train for Juvisy and all the small stations in the suburbs of Paris.\nVery few people were making for the train to Luchon; but a large crowd was pressing into the suburban train.\n\nThe porter who was piloting M. Etienne Rambert, set the baggage he was carrying down on the footboard of a first-class carriage.\n\n\"There is no one for the slow train yet, sir; if you like to get in first you can choose your own compartment.\"\n\nM. Etienne Rambert acted on the suggestion, but he had hardly set foot in the corridor before the guard, also scenting a generous tip, came to offer his services.\n\n\"It really is the 8.50 you want, sir?\" was his first enquiry. \"You are sure you are not making a mistake?\"\n\n\"No,\" Etienne Rambert replied. \"Why?\"\n\n\"A great many first-class passengers do make a mistake,\" the man explained, \"and confuse the 8.50 with the 8.45 express.\"\n\nAs he spoke the guard took the baggage from the porter who had remained on the platform, and the porter, after being generously remunerated for his trouble by M. Rambert, hurried away to look for other travellers.\n\n\"The 8.45 is the express, isn't it?\" M. Rambert enquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" the guard answered; \"it runs right through without stopping at all the small stations as this train does. It goes in front of this one and gets to Luchon three hours earlier. There it is on the side there,\" and he pointed through the window in the door on the far side to another train on the next rails, in which a number of travellers were already taking their seats. \"If you prefer to go by that one, sir,\" he went on, \"there is still time for you to change; you are entitled to take your choice since you have a first-class ticket.\"\n\nBut Etienne Rambert, after a moment's consideration, declined the suggestion.\n\n\"No: I would rather go by the slow train. If I take the express I should have to get out at Brives, and then I should be twelve or thirteen miles from Saint-Jaury, which is my destination; whereas the slow train stops at Verri\u00e8res, where, by the way, I have already telegraphed to say I shall arrive to-morrow morning.\"\n\nHe walked a little way along the corridor, assuring himself that the various compartments were still quite empty, and then turned to the guard.\n\"Look here, my man,\" he said, \"I am awfully tired, and I mean to get some sleep to-night; consequently I should like to be alone. Now where shall I be most quiet and undisturbed?\"\n\nThe man understood. M. Etienne Rambert's enquiry about the place where he would be most quiet, was an implicit promise of a handsome tip if nobody did disturb him.\n\n\"If you like to settle yourself here, sir,\" the man answered, \"you can draw down the blinds at once, and I dare say I shall be able to find room for any other passengers somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said M. Rambert, moving towards the compartment indicated. \"I will smoke a cigar until the train starts, and immediately afterwards I will settle down to sleep. By the way, my man, since you seem so obliging, I wish you would undertake to call me to-morrow morning in time for me to get out at Verri\u00e8res. I am desperately sleepy and I am quite capable of not waking up.\"\n\nThe guard touched his cap.\n\n\"You can be perfectly easy, sir, and sleep without the least anxiety. I won't fail.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nWhen his baggage had been stowed away, and his rugs spread out to make the seat more comfortable still, M. Etienne Rambert repeated his appeal, for he was an old traveller and knew that it does not do to rely too much upon the promises of chance attendants.\n\n\"I can rely upon you, can't I? I may sleep as sound as I like, and you will wake me at Verri\u00e8res?\" And the more to assure himself that the guard would execute his orders he slipped a franc into his hand.\n\nWhen he was left alone, M. Rambert continued his preparations for the night. He carefully drew down the blinds over the door and over the windows of the compartment that gave on to the corridor, and also lowered the shade over the electric light, and then, in order to enjoy the last puffs at his cigar in peace, he opened the window over the other door and leant his elbows on it, watching the final preparations being made by the travellers by the express on the other line.\n\nThe departure of a train is always a picturesque sight, and M. Rambert leant forward inquisitively to note how the passengers had installed themselves in the two compartments which he could see from his coign of vantage.\n\nThere were not many people in the train. As a matter of fact the Brives and Luchon line is not much used at this time of year. If the number of passengers in the express were any criterion Etienne Rambert might reasonably expect that he would be the only one in the slow train. But there was not much time for observations and reflections of this kind. On the platform for the express, which he got a glimpse of through the compartments, people were hurrying up their farewells. The passengers had got into their carriages, and the friends who had come to see them off were standing alone upon the platform. There was the sound of safety locks being fastened by porters, and the noise of trollies being wheeled along bearing articles for sale.\n\n\"Pillows! Rugs! Sweets! Papers!\"\n\nThen came the whistle of the guard, the shriller scream from the electric engine, and then, slowly at first but steadily, more rapidly as the engine got up speed, the express moved along the platform and plunged into the tunnel on the way to Austerlitz.\n\nMeanwhile the guard of the slow train was doing wonders. Shamelessly resolved to assure perfect quiet to \"his\" passenger, he managed, without unduly compromising himself but yet without leaving any doubt about it in any mind, to insinuate discreetly that M. Rambert's carriage was reserved, so that that gentleman might count upon an entirely undisturbed night.\n\nA few minutes after the express had gone, the slow train drew out in its turn, and disappeared into the darkness of the underground tunnel.\n\nAt the ch\u00e2teau of Beaulieu young Charles Rambert was just finishing dressing when a gentle tap sounded on the door of his room.\n\n\"It is a quarter to five, Charles. Get up at once!\"\n\n\"I am awake already, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se,\" Charles Rambert answered with some pride. \"I shall be ready in two minutes.\"\n\n\"What? up already?\" the girl exclaimed from the other side of the door. \"Marvelous! I congratulate you. I'm ready too; I will wait for you in the dining-room. Come down as soon as you are dressed.\"\n\n\"All right!\" the young man answered.\n\nHe wasted no time over his toilette, the more so because it was none too warm in his room, for at this early hour it was still quite dark; and then taking his light in one hand he opened his door carefully so as to make no noise, tip-toed along the landing, and went down the staircase to join Th\u00e9r\u00e8se in the dining-room. The girl was an accomplished housekeeper already, and while waiting for the young fellow she had got a scratch meal together.\n\n\"Let us have breakfast quickly,\" she suggested; \"it isn't snowing this morning, and if you like we might walk to the station. We have plenty of time, and it will do us good to have a walk.\"\n\n\"It will warm us up anyhow,\" Charles Rambert replied; he was only half-awake, but he sat beside Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and did justice to the preparations she had made.\n\n\"Do you know that it is very wonderful of you to get up so punctually?\" Mme. de Langrune's granddaughter remarked. \"How did you manage it? Last night you were afraid you would sleep on as usual.\"\n\n\"It was not much trouble for me to wake up,\" Charles Rambert answered. \"I hardly closed an eye all night.\"\n\n\"But I promised to come and knock at your door myself, so you might have slept without any anxiety.\"\n\n\"That's so, but to tell you the truth, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, I was regularly upset and excited by the thought of papa arriving this morning.\"\n\nThey had both finished breakfast, and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se got up.\n\n\"Shall we start?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se opened the hall door, and the two young people went down the flight of steps leading to the garden. The girl had thrown a big cloak over her shoulders, and she inhaled the pure morning air with keen delight.\n\n\"I love going out in the early morning,\" she declared.\n\n\"Well, I don't like it at all,\" Charles Rambert confessed with characteristic candour. \"Good Lord, how cold it is! And it is still pitch dark!\"\n\n\"Surely you are not going to be frightened?\" said Th\u00e9r\u00e8se teasingly.\n\nCharles Rambert made an irritable movement of vexation and surprise.\n\n\"Frightened? What do you take me for, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se? If I don't like going out in the early morning it's really only because it is cold.\"\n\nShe laughed at him while they were crossing the lawn towards the out-buildings, through which she meant to get out on to the high road. As they passed the stables they came across a groom who was leisurely getting an old brougham out of the coach-house.\n\n\"Don't hurry, Jean,\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se called out as she greeted him. \"We are going to walk to the station, and the only important thing is that you should be there to bring us back.\"\n\nThe man touched his cap and the two young people passed through the park gate and found themselves upon the high road.\n\nIt was still very dark, with just a wan reflection in the distance of the sky vaguely outlining some cloud-shapes to the eastward to give some promise of the day. There was no sound to break the silence of the fields, and as they walked briskly along Charles and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se could hear their footsteps ringing on the hard surface of the frozen ground.\n\n\"It must please you awfully to be going to meet your father,\" said Mme. de Langrune's granddaughter half questioningly. \"It is a long time since you have seen him, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Three years,\" Charles Rambert answered, \"and then just for a few minutes. He is coming home from America now, and before that he travelled in Spain for a long time.\"\n\n\"He was travelling the whole time you were a child, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, always: either in Colombia, looking after his rubber plantations there, or in Spain, where he has a good deal of property too. When he was in Paris he used to come to the school and ask for me, and I saw him in the parlour\u2014for a quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"And your mother?\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma was different. You know, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, I spent all  the childhood that I can remember at the school. I liked the masters and had good chums, and was very happy there, and if the truth must be told I looked forward with anything but pleasure to the holidays, when I had to go to my parents' house. I always felt a stranger with them; my real home was the school-room, where I had my desk and all my own interests. And then, you know, when one is little one doesn't understand things much; I didn't feel having hardly any family, very much.\"\n\n\"But you loved your mother very much?\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se asked the question quite anxiously, and it was patent that she would have thought it dreadful if her companion had not had a real affection for his mother.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I loved her,\" Charles Rambert answered; \"but I hardly knew her either.\" And as Th\u00e9r\u00e8se showed her surprise he went on, telling her something of the secret of his lonely childhood. \"You see, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, now that I am a man I guess lots of things that I could not have had even a suspicion of then. My father and mother did not get on well together. They were what you call an ill-assorted couple. They were both very good, but their characters did not harmonise. When I was little I always saw mamma silent and sad, and papa active and on the go, and bright and talking at the top of his voice. I half believe he frightened mamma! And then my father was constantly away, whereas mamma hardly ever went out. When a servant took me to the house on Thursdays, I was taken up to say good morning to her, and I invariably found her lying on a sofa in her room, with the blinds down and almost dark. She just touched me with her lips and asked me one or two questions, and then I was taken away again because I tired her.\"\n\n\"Was she ill, then?\"\n\n\"Mamma always has been ill. I suppose you know, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, that three months ago\u2014stay, it was just when I had taken my degree and went to Germany\u2014she was sent to an asylum? I believe my father had wanted her to agree to undergo careful treatment of the kind long before, but she would not.\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se was silent for a few minutes.\n\n\"You have not been very happy,\" she said presently.\n\n\"Oh, it was only after I grew up that I felt unhappy. When I was a little chap I never thought of how sad it is to have no real father or mother. The last four or five years it has hurt me, but when he came to see me once at school, papa told me he would take me with him as soon as I had taken my degree and grown up. Last October, after my examination, he wrote and told me to be patient a little longer, and that he was hurrying on with the winding up of his business and coming back to France. That gave me a hope which has brightened these last few months, and will also make you understand why I am so pleased this morning at my fathers coming. It seems to me that a new life is going to begin.\"\n\nDay was breaking now: a dirty December day, with the light filtering through heavy grey clouds that drifted along the ground, hid the horizon, clung to the low hills, and then suddenly dispersed in long wisps driven by a keen breeze, that got up in gusts, and drove clouds of dust along the hard frozen ground.\n\n\"I have not been very happy either,\" said Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, \"for I lost my father when I was tiny: I don't even remember him; and mamma must be dead as well.\"\n\nThe ambiguous turning of the child's phrase caught Charles Rambert's interested attention.\n\n\"What does that mean, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se? Don't you know if your mother is dead?\"\n\n\"Yes, oh yes; grandmamma says so. But whenever I ask for particulars grandmamma always changes the subject. I will echo what you said just now: when you are little you don't know anything and are not surprised at anything. For a long time I took no notice of her sudden reticence, but now I sometimes wonder if something is not being kept back from me\u2014whether it is really true that mamma is no more in this world.\"\n\nTalking like this Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Charles had walked at a good pace, and now they came to the few houses built around Verri\u00e8res station. One by one, bedroom windows and doors were being opened; peasants were making their way to the sheds to lead their cattle to the pastures.\n\n\"We are very early,\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se remarked, pointing to the station clock in the distance. \"Your father's train is due at 6.55, and it is only 6.40 now; we still have a quarter of an hour to wait, and more, if the train is not punctual!\"\n\nThey went into the little station and Charles Rambert, thankful for some shelter from the cold, stamped his feet, making a sudden uproar in the empty waiting-room. A porter appeared.\n\n\"Who the deuce is kicking up all this row?\" he began angrily, and then seeing Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, broke off short. \"Ah, Mademoiselle Th\u00e9r\u00e8se,\" he said with the familiar yet perfectly respectful cordiality that marks country folk, \"up already? Have you come to meet somebody, or are you going away?\"\n\nAs he spoke, the porter turned a curious eye upon Charles Rambert, whose arrival had caused quite a sensation two days before in this little spot, where with but few exceptions none but people belonging to the neighbourhood ever came by train.\n\n\"No, I am not going away,\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied. \"I have accompanied M. Rambert, who has come to meet his father.\"\n\n\"Ah-ha, to meet your papa, sir: is he coming from far?\"\n\n\"From Paris,\" Charles Rambert answered. \"Is the train signalled yet?\"\n\nThe man drew out a watch like a turnip, and looked at the time.\n\n\"It won't be here for quite another twenty minutes. The work on the tunnel makes it necessary to be careful, and it's always late now. But you will hear when the bell rings: that will be when the train is coming over the level-crossing; it will run into the station three minutes after that. Well, Mademoiselle, I must get on with my work,\" and the man left them.\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se turned to Charles Rambert.\n\n\"Shall we go on to the platform? Then we shall see the train come in.\"\n\nSo they left the waiting-room and began to walk up and down the whole length of the platform. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se watched the jerky movements of the hands of the clock, and smiled at her companion.\n\n\"Five minutes more, and your father will be here! Four minutes more! Ah! There it is!\" and she pointed to a slope in the distance where a slight trail of smoke rose white against the blue of the sky, now clear of cloud. \"Can't you see it? That is the steam from the engine coming out of the tunnel.\"\n\nEre she finished speaking the quivering whir of the bell echoed through the empty station.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Charles Rambert: \"at last!\"\n\nThe two porters who, with the stationmaster, constituted the entire railway staff at Verri\u00e8res, came bustling along the platform, and while the bell continued its monotonous whirring ring, pulled forward trucks in readiness for any possible luggage. Puffing portentously, the engine slackened speed, and the heavy train slowed down and finally stopped, bringing a noisy atmosphere of life into the station of Verri\u00e8res that but a moment ago was so still.\n\nThe first-class carriages had stopped immediately in front of Charles and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and on the footboard Etienne Rambert stood, a tall, elderly man of distinguished appearance, proud bearing and energetic attitude, with extraordinarily keen eyes and an unusually high and intelligent forehead. Seeing Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Charles he seized his baggage and in a twinkling had sprung on to the platform. He dropped his valise, tossed his bundle of rugs on to a seat, and gripped Charles by the two shoulders.\n\n\"My boy!\" he exclaimed; \"my dear boy!\"\n\nAlthough he had hitherto shown so little affection for his child, it was obvious that the man was making a great effort to restrain his emotion, and was really moved when he now saw him again as a grown young man.\n\nNor, on his part, did Charles Rambert remain unmoved. As if the sudden grip of this almost stranger, who yet was his father, had awakened a world of memories within him, he turned very pale and his voice faltered as he replied:\n\n\"Papa! Dear papa! I am so glad to see you!\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se had drawn tactfully aside. M. Rambert still held his son by the shoulders and stepped back a pace, the better to consider him.\n\n\"Why, you are a man! How you have altered, my boy! You are just what I hoped you would be: tall and strong! Ah, you are my son all right! And you are quite well, hey? Yet you look tired.\"\n\n\"I did not sleep well,\" Charles explained with a smile. \"I was afraid I should not wake up.\"\n\nTurning his head, M. Rambert saw Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and held out his hand.\n\n\"How do you do, my little Th\u00e9r\u00e8se?\" he exclaimed. \"You have altered too since I saw you last. I left a little chit of a child, and now I behold a grown-up young lady. Well! I must be off at once to pay my respects to my dear old friend, your grandmother. All well at the ch\u00e2teau, eh?\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se shook hands warmly with M. Rambert and thanked him prettily.\n\n\"Grandmamma is very well; she told me to tell you to excuse her if she did not come to meet you, but her doctor says she must not get up very early.\"\n\n\"Of course your grandmamma is excused, my dear. Besides, I have to thank her for her kindness to Charles, and for the hospitality she is going to extend to me for a few days.\"\n\nMeanwhile the train had gone on again, and now a porter came up to M. Rambert.\n\n\"Will you take your luggage with you, sir?\"\n\nRecalled to material things, Etienne Rambert contemplated his trunk which the porters had taken out of the luggage van.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he began, but Th\u00e9r\u00e8se interrupted him.\n\n\"Grandmamma said she would send for your heavy luggage during the morning, and that you could take your valise and any small parcels with us in the brougham.\"\n\n\"What's that? Your grandmamma has taken the trouble to send her carriage?\"\n\n\"It's a long way to Beaulieu, you know,\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied. \"Ask Charles if it isn't. We came on foot and the walk would be too tiring for you after a whole night in the train.\"\n\nThe three had reached the station yard, and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se stopped in surprise.\n\n\"Why, how's that?\" she exclaimed; \"the carriage is not here.  And yet Jean was beginning to get it ready when we left the ch\u00e2teau.\"\n\nM. Etienne Rambert was resting one hand on his son's shoulder, and contemplating him with an affectionate, all-embracing survey every now and then. He smiled at Th\u00e9r\u00e8se.\n\n\"He may have been delayed, dear. I tell you what we will do. Since your grandmamma is going to send for my luggage there is no need for me to take my valise; we can leave everything in the cloak-room and start for the ch\u00e2teau on foot; if my memory serves me right\u2014and it is a very good memory\u2014there is only one road, so we shall meet Jean and can get into the carriage on the way.\"\n\nA few minutes later all three set out on the road to Beaulieu. M. Rambert walked between the two young people; he had gallantly offered his arm to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, who was not a little proud of the attention, which proved to her mind that she was now regarded as a grown-up young lady. On the other side of his father Charles made answer to the incessant questions put to him.\n\nM. Etienne Rambert enjoyed the walk in the quiet morning through the peaceful country-side. With a tender half-melancholy he recognised every turn in the road, every bit of scenery.\n\n\"Just fancy my coming back here at sixty years of age, with a great son of eighteen!\" he said with a laugh. \"And I remember as if it were yesterday the good times I have had at the ch\u00e2teau of Beaulieu. Mme. de Langrune and I will have plenty of memories to talk over. Gad! it must be quite forty years since I came this way, and yet I remember every bit of it. Say, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, isn't it the fact that we shall see the front of the ch\u00e2teau directly we have passed this little copse?\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" the girl answered with a laugh. \"You know the country very well, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Etienne Rambert; \"when one gets to my age, little Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, one always does remember the happy days of one's youth; one remembers recent events much less distinctly. Most likely that means, my dear, that the human heart declines to grow old and refuses to preserve any but pictures of childhood.\"\n\nFor a few minutes M. Rambert remained silent, as if absorbed in somewhat melancholy reflections. But he soon recovered himself and shook off the tender sadness evoked in his mind by memories of the past.\n\n\"Why, the park enclosure has been altered,\" he exclaimed. \"Here is a wall which used not to be here: there was only a hedge.\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se laughed.\n\n\"I never knew the hedge,\" she said. \"I have always seen the wall.\"\n\n\"Must we go on to the main gate?\" M. Rambert asked, \"or has your grandmamma had another gate made?\"\n\n\"We are going in by the out-buildings,\" the girl answered; \"then we shall hear why Jean did not come to meet us.\" She opened a little door half-hidden among the moss and ivy that clothed the wall surrounding the park, and making M. Rambert and Charles pass in before her, cried: \"But Jean has gone with the brougham, for the horses are not in the stable. How was it we did not meet him?\" Then she laughed. \"Poor Jean!

You're saying you're above battle rap?\"\nNo, you\u2005dumb\u2005motherfuckers, I never\u2005said that\nI just had to pursue\u2005what I love\nIf that's something you view as a snub, that's a you problem\nThese rounds, Diz you really got a Jew problem\nMegaton better come with a new nuke on 'em\nThroat sores, so I'm goin' Michael Jordan with the flu on 'em\nAm I better than this? No\nBut I'm better than you\nNot as a battler, listen, I'ma say this\nNot necessarily not as a battler, but as a person, that's what the evidence proves\nWhen I present it to you\nYou might pretend it's a ruse\nAnd I intend to confuse\nYou know what they say about those treacherous Jews\nI have a question for you\nSaw you vs Iron\nShit's brilliant\nBut now that this Jew got next, tell me\nHow many Jew jokes have you got left?\nHold on, let me guess; six million?\nBut let me get back, to reflectin' and building on all that it happened\nSince I left the field like I was Dr. Manhattan\nI was living off of my rapping\n'till I tied the knot, then I got into a tighter spot\nThen I had to find a job\nBut\nWait, sorry fuck\nSo Diz', a job is a place where you go to make money\nLike an office or store\nYou ever seen The Office before?\nIt's like that, but less funny\nAnd then you get a check\nYou can spend it on your food and ya rent\nFuck, I'm doing it again\nSo Diz', rent...\nI'll take it slow\nSee rent is this thing where you know find a place, and you pay money to stay monthly\nSee, I ain't know if you're aware of it, because you ain't left your parents till your fuckin' late 20s\nSo according to you, right, on Twitter you called me a \"manchild\"\nThe audacity!\nThat you, mister level headed adult\nYOU called me a \"manchild\" that is damn wild\nYou were living with your mom and dad while\nI was in my own crib, diggin' up dirt on QP for that damn file\nBack to that Iron battle, you know I gotta say\nThe angle about Jews not going to work on 9/11, kinda clever\nExcept you didn't go to work on 9-- ever\nSee down the line I went through shit\nMy crew split\nAs too did my creative drive, my will to stay alive took a huge dip\nAnd my momma got too sick\nDown to a toothpick\nAnd I stopped makin' music\nSee the sad thing is Diz, you said I tried and I flopped\nNah, it was going fine, then I stopped\nIt was painful, truly\nSee, I know it sounds sad, but Soul is still a Joker though\nI ain't talking about the Gotham kind\nTalking like Persona 5\nThat is what I was personified\nCause I lost track of all the kind of monsters I had caught inside\nEspecially the one whisperin' to me that I oughta die\nSo bottom line, there is nothing you can say to me\nThat is more evil than the shit I used to tell myself all the time\nI got out that coma I been frozen lately\nI gotta thanks all the homies that could motivate me\nEven though the road was shaky\nLike the way Dizaster's parents thought it was okay to hold a baby\nSo now y'all here to see my return to the format\nYou here to be my personal doormat\nHold up\nBefore we go all that\nDo battle rappers still say dumb shit like \"you catch a shell, then you sleep like Squirtle and Snorlax\"?\nNo, good\nWell ignore that, fantastic\nYou know, I respect you Diz, because you're willing to give someone the shirt off your back\nEven when they didn't need it, or were asking you for that\nHe takes his shirt off all the time\nAnd I know you like to make fun of the way I make apologies\nLot of liberals are faker than astrology\nI'm not a liberal, I'm a leftist, and the difference is tremendous\nAnd there's one thing I have to say, it's gotta be legit\nI am sorry, for every bomb that Israel has ever launched at Lebanon\nThey always got a reason and each of them is fucking extra wrong\nThe IDF level houses, you know, bring fiery death on thousands\nMaybe someone you knew\nNah I ain't pushing no button, but, Israeli government always said they do it in the name of the Jews\nThis ain't a angle or a gimmick, fuck the haters and the cynics\nBut I refuse to accept that any Jew is protected by doing something so fuckin' hateful to you\nOn top of all that\nAnd all the while, the West Bank has gotten terrorized\nEvery day in Gaza's genocide\nAnd America could end it by threatening to ends its ties\nBut they just always defend it\nAnd the Palestinians get left to die\nAt this point, Diz probably thinkin'\nThis ain't therapy\nDiz, that ain't fair to me\nBecause I gotta grapple in my disgrace\nAnd my old battles are like your face, they've aged terribly\nAnd to everybody, to all you who suggested; \"No SJW stuff\"\nI've reviewed your request, and, shut the fuck up!\nI know they hate it when I do this, but sorry, I'm accountable\nSo, I am sorry if I have hurt anyone who was marginalized with the words that I'd use\nEspecially cause it doesn't reflect my personal views\nI fucked up so much\nAnd that's being accountable\nBeing a fuckin' shithead is not a fuckin' alpha move\nAnd it's like fuckin', and I'm not talkin' about like some light politeness like not talking when ya mouth is full\n[Dizaster] I'm the only one reacting\n\n[Soul Khan]\nAnd that's why it's the best line\nSee what you refer to as political correctness is just giving some respect for a minute or a second, it's forethought\nAnd if you dismiss and reject it\nCause you think it's makes you different or you're edgy\nYou're not\nSo, what to do?\nDiz, what are your preferred gender pronouns?\nUsually say like he, him, his, whatever\nSo mine are he, him, his\nLook at how easy that it is\nIt only takes fuckin' two seconds\nBut all these anti PC motherfuckers will complain for hours about it\nAnd how PC it is\nSo let me make the math\nThere are more than two genders, your eyebrows look like two sweaters\nDisgustingly huge pairs, fuck tweezers, use Nair\nI bet the effort it takes to groom is tremendous\nIf you have one square up there, you'd win at Tetris\nI mean this in the kindest way\nSo what happened?\nEverything that happened after Math, I have to ask\nShould I be scared of you?\nOr do you only attack me if I dare you to?\nDiz, Diz, c'mon man, are you, wait a second\nAm I getting this right\nWill you do anything to anybody dares you to?\nAre you sure?\nChallenge accepted\nToo bad\nConsent negative, my bad\nAlright so, JK, you can't be that, don't do that, always say that\nAnyway so, challenge accepted\nDiz...I dare you to kiss me\nI mean my man\nI ain't pausin' shit, I ain't pausin' shit\nIn 2019, we past pausin'\nHold up, hold up\nCan anyone else do this shit\nIt ain't scary or risky\nGo back to the hotel, share some whisky\nMy girl's okay with it\nC'mon tough guy, you gon' kiss me or not?\nC'mon! No!\nYou gon' kiss me\nHold on, this the important part\nC'mon tough guy, you gon' kiss me or not?\nPut Your Money Where Your Mouth Iz, King of the Dot!\nYou might also like[Dizaster]\nThis was his plan to defuse all my shit. Is it my turn?\n\n[Soul Khan]\nSo, no, no man. This is a long round. I'm doing a long round for you! It's for you!\n\nI dare you\nI dare to not rap forever and render this unwatchable\nI dare you to fight our friend Math and not end up in the hospital\nI can't fly all the way to see it\nIn any case, I dare you to make a song that isn't absolute garbage\nSo you could be an actual artist\nInstead of pretending to be the rapper you aren't\nBut...also sir, I gotta say, those braids\nThey are ridiculous dude\nIf you hate the culture vultures, you officially lose\nYou look like a white girl gettin' her groove on a Caribbean cruise\nBut\nHold on\nDiz, is this some sort of style of hair of Arabs I'm unaware of?\nI mean this shit is you? No, this shit is new\nI remember the old days, when your hair used to be\nYou would see\nIn a park full of skaters\nSo many spikes it was like your barber was playing a game of Mario Maker\nIf you wanna use Sega\nYour coif is a mess dawg\nOut there looking like Islamic the Hedgehog\nWait a second though, I'm sensitive to this shit\nIs that offensive to y'all, or the, you watching at home\nCause I felt it was like borderline\nSorta like when Madness called me Jew-Pac Shalom\nWhich is funny-\nDiz, my friend is\nIs it offensive to you Diz?\nMight be a reason to pretend that it is\nWe both know a secret\nYou oughta know\nLet me take you back\nI recently remembered\nWhen you and I were at Club Excess\nIn a pit like this\nDoin' shit like this\nAnd\nDiz was saying, this and that, I wasn't listening\nYou know what Diz is like?\nIt's a thing\nThing, the moment that burned in my memory\nIs when he turned and he said to me\nYo bro, it's funny, I ain't exactly Muslim shit\nAnd I was like, what? good lord!\nDiz, are you telling us?\nThat through your entire battling career, and you've been battling for years, a third of your life, earning your stripes\nYou led us to believe that you're Muslim, and this whole motherfucking time\nYou never actually said one\nYou not exactly, I never was gonna say that\nSee he says, I never said I was a Muslim\nBut you say it in the battles, not the interviews\nBut every time the interviewer calls you Muslim, you never correct or interrupt him\nThat's disgusting\nDon't play, I ain't a bit amused\nCause--\n[Dizaster]\nI'm an offshoot of Islam, that's why\n\n[Soul Khan]\nNhhh, yeah that's debatable\nBut relatable\nSo\nWell no I'm talking in your relation on what you do\nYou misrepresent yourself to your fans and to your opponents\nI want them to take themselves back to the moments\nAnd the raps that you told em\nUsing cultural standings that ain't actually holding\nAre you of the mind that just because racist thinks all Arabs are in terror groups\nThat that makes it fair for you\nTo uphold the stereotypes of terror too?\nWhat about Muslims who aren't Arab, dude?\nYou don't know think South Asians and African Muslims get hassled at customs?\nOr that their women in hijabs and burkas are afraid of getting shot and murdered\nDue to the rise in fucking Islamic, anti-Islamic fervor?\nSo he has a rebuttal\nI'm sure that shit is subtle\nYou know a lot of the old Jewish lines I had were fucking foolish\nBut the difference between that and you is\nI'm actually fucking Jewish\nLike, this here, was his decision\nAnd now we in this position\nYou hate the cultures vultures, what are you, a religion pigeon?\nI mean obviously\nYou're Arab, so you know the language and the basic protocol\nBut you faking overall\nI guess Dizaster is just Arabic for Rachel Dolezal\nEither way, you lied so these people have no reason to even slightly believe you\nOr\nI have just freed you\nTo finally be you\nDiz, do you hear this\nDo you recognize the scheme\nSee where I'm trying to lead you\nIt's Soul Khan, from the last tribe of the Hebrews\nListen Diz, you can admit it\nHonestly, you don't wanna do it out loud\nAnd that's just too much to ask though\nThat's fine\nIf you're not Muslim, just stand here, looking like the world's stupidest asshole\nOh damnit, I'm so proud of you\nThat probably took a lot of you\nRight?\nHonestly\nI don't wanna do anything more on this verse\nBut if this contest of a honor, pride and our worth\nIt's just a motherfucking homicide in the first\nBut, if that ain't enough\nYou just get to serve me\nI don't give a fuck\nCause in 2021, your president is Bernie\n(Diz: you done?)\nI could be, hold on\nI like you just wobbling back and forth\n(Diz: c'mon pull something out, c'mon rebuttal something)\nNo, I don't want to right now\nJust looking at you like, sorta like, wobbling, yeah go Diz, it's your turn\n\n[Round 1: Dizaster]\nOh it's my turn?\nY'all ready for some shit?!\nWhat the fuck was that?\nWhat the fuck was that?\nAy trust me, we gon get to the Muslim in round 3, but right now\nWoo!\nWe gotta address fucking MC Dry Milk\nThis ain't a battle, this a race to see which one of us gon' be the first to get this guy killed\nMe, or his white guilt\nFucking Soul Khan\nI'm not the person to step to\nYeah, we gon' start off with this because honestly, I'm not here to psychologically test you\nI'm here to open up a door, for everybody to get through\nJust like a West Hollywood rest room\nIf I get mad today, I'mma just say \"F you\"\nInstead of wishing death on you, I'ma just wish I never met you\nHe wants to gender stuff, we can all be men, women too, c'mon\nEven though y'all don't believe it, a lot of y'all like to pretend to\nJust like your mom did to fulfill the role of your pops when he left you\nLeft you, without a dope beat to step to\nStep one: this a battle, I ain't gotta respect you\nStep two: you only here cause the rent's due\nYour bitch left you\nAnd the music not bringing the checks through\nStep three: he couldn't make a return unless he\nWent against me\nThe leader of the LGBT\nGoing against a WMD\nHe's a proud SJW\nHe's G-L-A-D to be the CEO of a bunch of new groups\nA-B-C-D-E-F-G's\nThe H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P's\nThe Q-R-S, the T-U-V's, and don't you forget those X-Y-Z's\nAre you fucking kidding me?\nYou said you quit battle rap, what you back here using us for?\nYou said you wouldn't return till you had a Grammy\nYou think we forgot the stupid shit you used to say and do from before\nYou said you was done with this game, you gon make go music and hit the booth and record\nI guess it's safe to say he's back with the Canadians since America couldn't give this Jew no award (Juno Award)\nHold on, hold on\nHow long you gonna fucking hold on for?\nIt's been 9 years of you holdin' on\nRecording songs\nWe thought you would blow up by now man, what's going on?\nWhy have you not got put on?\nI thought you'd have some soul hits by now, but you don't\nWhat a shocker, Khan (Chaka Khan)\nI thought Brown Bag was growin' strong\nBut now you trying to weasel your way in with us and sneak back in and just roll along\nAnd you want us to welcome you with open arms\nLike I'm the vulture, pff, like we wouldn't notice you wrong\nRight now, you walkin' in so many different directions, you like a child outside tryin' to find a Pok\u00e9mon\nAnd this is how all these silver spoon posers are\nThe moment they don't get what they want, that's the moment they gone\nAnd I stayed here, puttin' in blood, sweat and tears, helping put this culture on\nAnd that will always be the difference between your pros and your cons (Khans)\nKhan you a fuckin' con artist\nYou know what rhymes with \"Soul Khan\"?\n(What?)\n\"This guy spends more time with Nancy Pelosi than he does with his own mom\"\nBut now he's back, and he's focused on\nBattle rap, he's back like he never left\nReturnin' in the era of gun rhymes, pickin' the one guy that could give you punchlines and multis\nMultiplied by hundred times of deaths, so follow the pattern\nCause you ain't getting the one liners yet\nFuck a gun rhyme\nBring your little anti-gun sign\nCause I ain't got a gun\nI'm here to contaminate ya bloodline with a rusty knife instead\nPuncture puncture, slice\nMake your skull rupture like there was busted waterpipe of lead\nGushing by your head\nGet your onion diced, I'll oven fry your egg\nCut and slice your chest\nOpen up ya eye with it\nLeave it stuck inside your neck\nAnd watch the whole other side go dead like the Butterfly Effect\nThey put a butter knife against a butterfly knife\nThis is the different between cookie cutter rhymes and someone who designs lines to be cutting edge\nAll you got is these lies you spread\nYou literally talk out the side of your neck\nI'm really cut throat\nSo if you running ya mouth, you'll catch a Columbian necktie if I see a tongue comin' out\nWatch out\nYou a bum now\nI been on my Nate Dogg shit\nWatched ya high come down\nI became the professor of this campus\nYou dropped out as a Cub Scout\nSince you returned as one of my students, well this could only one route\nOh you don't think I'm your teacher huh\nWell you will when I blaow, have you spittin' your gums out\nPhluh, now you have a yuck mouth (Yukmouth)\nYou see the signs when the Blood starts to come out\nSpeaking of cuttin', you cut ya legacy short\nAnd you pressured to come back in the game cause you're stuck now\nAnd we supposed to welcome you like this successful legend like...\nWhat the fuck? How?\nCause he got 3,000,000 views versus QP? Fuck, wow\nSince then, I left that in a dust cloud\nWhile you spent the rest of your career like \"50 Cent trying to knock another SON down.\"\nGot so outta touch, he's like Al Bundy to us now\nWhich means ya battles with Madness, Fox, Deacon, QP would be your four famous touchdowns\nFuck outta here, you like the Gjonaj of Polk High\nYou wonder why he ain't come down to no actual battles?\nHe's too busy at the farmer's market tryin' to haggle over free salad samples\nHe went from being a savage asshole\nTo hangin' out with 6 foot women who wear Versace sandals and have Adam's Apples\nAnd before we got the horrible, horrible, horrible news that you quit\nYou can admit, this dude who was sick\nHe just hasn't, you know, been the same dude ever since they surgically removed his dick\nHe had a surgeon open up two little slits and fuse a clit made out of a pair of two human lips\nOn to the passageway where he used to piss\nAnd if you think this is bad, we're lucky he hasn't grew any tits\nHe's a fuckin' neutered Shih tzu with a uterus\nUsed to be a symbol of manhood like Mr. Bruce but all we got left is this confused little bitch\nOops, did I just say the \"b\" word?\nYou used to be as ruthless as it gets\nNow you don't use the word \"bitch\"?\nAre you kidding me?\nYou bitch!\nYou're the biggest misogynist ever...and you still are\nYou don't get to change the rules as you wish\nYou might be able to fool these stupid little new liberal groups that you with\nBut the beautiful thing about the internet is that it's forever...and Google is quick\nAnd YouTube is just two little clicks\n{click click}\nExhibit A:\nYou once told a dude, \"You're useless as a chick without the coochie and the tits\"\nListen, \"useless as a chick without the coochie and the tits\"\nNow I caught some slack for what I said to O'fficial\nBut I'll be honest, this some futuristic shit!\nNow this same dude's a feminist? Man that's as stupid as it gets\nLike you callin' people gay for all three of your rounds on all your old YouTube clips\nAnd now your excuse for it\nIs that you grew up since\nAnd you weren't worried about whose kids you were going to influence\nOr is it truly this?\nThat your new political views don't fit with the way that you used to spit\nSo you must've turned vegan too cause all of a sudden you super quick to come to a fruit's defense\nGod damn man, you too intense\nYou suffering from self delusion of how you view yourself\nStaring back at the mirror like, \"Who is this?\"\n\"Who am I?\" Who is this?\"\nI'll tell you who\nYou're the dude who called people \"homos\" and \"queers\" for most your career\nSo if you wanna act like we're the ones that are homophobic here\nEhhh that's sorta weird\nCause, I used to like you Soul Khan, at least back then you were more sincere\nYou once saw two dudes in the distance arguing about who says the word \"faggot\" more\nAnd you told the dude that was standing next to you, \"Yo. Hold my beer.\"\nHe's a fuckin' Fruit Ninja\nThe type that no one fears\nWhen he throws a bomb, he throws a bomb\nBut when the smoke screen clears\nHe reappears with a picket sign and a pair of pink pointy ears\nLike, \"I'm Soul Khan. Ready to fight this war\nStanding on the frontline with my big homie Michael Moore.\"\nSoul Khan, been a Socialist for so long his hands and knees is sore\nHad sunken cheekbones like a Swedish whore\nHe consumes Twitter feeds, he doesn't even eat no more\nHe's no longer the person he used to be before\nJust to act as his own manhood he has to speak to it through a Ouija Board\nI am literally raising Hell!\nAnd after this you might as well change your name as well\nI'ma make you hate yourself\nWhen you leave here you gonna feel the same way you felt when you watch the new Dave Chappelle\nFace it, you just outdated\nYou basic and stale, tryin' to break away from the shell\nYour music sucks, no one gives a fuck if you sell\nSo tonight, you gon' be like Sheriff Hopper\nCause you gon' have a tough time puttin' up with this L (El')\nI'm an O.G\nKing Of The Dot knows there's no show if there's no me\nI go O.D\nI'm like Eleven from Stranger Things\nCause I can even channel my energy to reach the nose bleeds\nGot me teleporting like a flesh absorbing demogorgon\nThe best in this sport, I'm forever Jordan\nThe game change, became way colder\nCaught him slippin' in the Range Rover\nStart [?] with the flamethrower\nHe wants to ban AK's then fuck it, the shotgun can hit you from way closer\nOperation Roc-A-Wear with Jay Hova\nI'll put your brain on your Dame's shoulders\nAwe man, here we go again\n\n{Diz puts on Groucho glasses and pulls out a folder and starts his Soul Khan impression}\n\nHe said, \"Brains on my Dame's shoulder\"\nHold on, hold on\nThat's why guns are bad for you Diz'\nAnd any true human will tell you that every firearm leads to a mass school shootin'\nListen, hold on, hold on\nBefore I leave any session you know I got a few more lines\nYeah, yeah, you will realize and do more time\nThat people like Twork are bad for the community\nCause they inspire my precious black youth to do more crime\nSo if you ever decide to use your tool\nFuck you, fuck you\nB. Dot you cool\nFuck you!\n\n[Round 2: Soul Khan]\nWhen he was in my face, I think, it probably hit me\nI was just thinking, wow, has he reconsidered my offer to kiss me?\nDiz, you're my homie though\nBut hold it man\nAnd I ain't trying to diss that flag you're wearin'\nBut I gotta say, it was kinda disorienting, for this dude who's my homie y'all\nTo talk about Pokemon when he literally looks like a fucking Pokeball\nSo, we got this\nSo, my friend, are you done?\nIf not, that's cool son\nI mean, I was just gonna go make a food run\nI get you some\nI was gonna cop some jerky, want a Slurpee?

I'm no longer racist and you gon' let me get away with it.\"\nYou a fuckin' hypocrite, contradict yourself in every statement you make\nYou just too fake to admit it\nCause you're really a closet fuckin' racist and that's why you got so many regrets\nAnd the difference between me and you is I had a clean conscious when I said it\nYou understand me?\nThis guy got nothin' but basic linguistics, he's way too simplistic\nHe gave up and quit\nJeffrey Epstein, it's clear he was never able to hang to begin with\nAw shit, this shit is painful\nHe gon' get a face full of stitches\nPaid In Full shit\nYeah, I'ma get creative with this\nYou think I hate you cause of your race?\nY'all are the chosen ones, man\nAn old generation that's bathing in riches\nI'm just mad at you cause you're the only Jew that hasn't created a business\nHow scary is this?\nMy race angles are very vicious\nI can put an end to a conversation with a Jew with two words; \"Merry Christmas\"\n\n[Round 3: Soul Khan]\nI fear like there's gotta be an explanation of the actual definition of hypocrisy\nSo, a hypocrite is someone who says one thing and does different shit\nWhereas I changed my entire life so your criticism doesn't apply\nAnd here's another thing that you should regard quick\nI didn't flop like I said, I quit music for a while\nYou're a terribly listener, no wonder your music is garbage\nYou think I'm a bigger geek than you\nMy friend, you're an anime obsessed fucking weeaboo\nI heard that got married, congratulations\nDo you call her your waifu?\nLike the awkwardest white dude\nDid you propose to her with cherry blossoms and haiku's\nIf it weren't for the fact that she probably wipes you\nI'd say, she probably feels like she got a 9th grader\nWhen she asks you to clean the bathroom, and you're like, \"you mean the Hyperbolic Time Chamber?\"\nWhat about the sex?\nIs it hotter when you roleplay\nAs Inuyasha and Kagome\nNow, do you think Diz is ever domestically violent?\nHeck no\nI'd say he never try it\nAnd every time him and his wife get into a fight, she finds a way to let go\nWhile you go in your basement and write her name in the Death Note\nDiz talks about the streets, he isn't from there\nHe's from our neighborhood, where the hot topic is that Hot Topic was replaced by Pacific Sunwear\nAnd the fact that you share a zip code with [?] just goes to show\nYou ain't naturally large, you just actually scarred\nAnd have low impulse control\nAre you okay man? you're doing okay, you'll get through with it\nAnd that's why your parents are afraid you'll share the fate of Sharon Tate\nSo every black friend of Dizaster is a professional actor that his parents paid to scare him straight\nIt's not working I think\nI have a question\nThey probably bail you out of all sorts of stupid shit that you do\nSo\nIt is, I'mma have to ask you, are you actually cool with?\nThe fact that you supported Trump and therefore backed a political movement that doesn't actually consider black people a human?\nYou okay man? you look so upset\nSo I'll say this\nLeupold good snooze, he's falling asleep, falling asleep, okay cool\nI heard your guns are lethal, popping with them tools\nCorrection, all your guns are legal, officer approved\n'cause ain't nothing more gangster than following the rules\nSomething that I noticed, when you first [?] around, you didn't spit gun bars a lot when you came into the circuit\nHow was it?\nCrafting them, waiting till they were perfect\nDid you wanna hone them even more, wait till you deserved it\nI got it now, you ain't spit gun bars cause you were waiting for a permit\nVery responsible of you\nYou always like to say that Americans have rights\nCorrection, America always has Arabs in its sights\nAmerica has rights, no America has kids in cages terrorized by ICE\nI'm telling you and asking you, man to man\nGo talk about American rights to the tombstone of Sandra Bland\nYou're a new husband, some day a prospective father\nTalk about American rights to the grandkids and kids of Eric Garner\nDiz, I agree that in many ways, Clinton would've been a evil killer\nBut the communities I work with, are truly getting hurt Diz\nAnd a lot of it is because that motherfucker Stephen Miller\nWho is it?\nOh golly shit man, Stephen Miller, the opponent by the guy you voted for\nAnd I know you changed your mind, but you can't change your time\nIt's kinda weird right now, it fucks me up a little bit\nI know this ain't your typical wordplay, work day\nBut it's a little disturbing you ain't know who Stephen Miller is, but you probably know like Piccolo's birthday\nSee, I have changed, Diz\nIt's proof, you don't agree cause you don't believe in evolution\nNo, like you don't actually believe in evolution\nLike the theory of Charles Darwin\nThe theory of evolution\nYou don't believe in evolution, it's the reason that we're human\nBut I do remember you have a thing for Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\nWell the man Schr\u00f6dinger that, conceived it and concluded it that even he fucking believed in evolution\nYou know what rhymes with Schr\u00f6dinger too?\nHe was inspired by Einstein, socialist Jew\nDiz, what you gonna do if battle rap vanishes\nAlright, what you gonna do\nWhere would you shift in your life\nI mean Real Deal is a educator\nOoops was a legislator\nFuck, what are you?\n\n{Dizaster whispers: \"a detonator\"}\n\nA son of privilege riding on a golden escalator with the social skills of a 2nd grader?\nMy man, you need to find something, to shift your life\nI still got music, just started again, [?]\nLet me give you some advice\nFind a mission that might not pay a lot but make you feel like you got skin in the fight\nHell, keep talkin' about Socialism, maybe you could join our organization DSA\nCome with us on this journey\nCause in 2021, I know you [?] about this, the president is Bernie\n\n[Round 3: Dizaster]\nAlright man that was cool...Jesus Christ\nI don't mean no offense by that by the way\nSee cracking jokes and laughing is fine\nBut let's get back to the stats and the actual signs\nYour total impact on battle rap is 12,000,000 views you have racked up online\nIn comparison I have 13,000,000 on one battle so technically one match up of mine\nHas more views on it than all your battles combined\nYeah, you have the battle in mind, but it's the cancerous kind\nThe type that thinks, \"Hmm. All these battlers are doin' is just passin' their time\nBut if they can't use this to boost their music then that can't get no shine.\"\n'Til someone shows him a picture of Tsu Surf and he takes off his glasses, \"Hmmm. I can't really see that. I'm actually blind.\"\nAnd this is how he was actin' when he was back in his prime\nI want you guys to try to imagine what he would've acted like if he actually got signed\n\"I'm Soul Khan and all you MC's are peasants!\"\nLet that sink in for a second\nAnd tell me this dude here is on my level\nWhen he hasn't even shown y'all enough love or wrote enough history\nAnd I still say this to little bro respectfully\nA two year stretch is like Bill Bellemy, that's a joke of a legacy\nSo whether he, do or don't have any respect for me\nIn the end, I'm still considered the legend on every top ten you see\nIf you even say the word \"battle rap\" my resume alone will force you to mention me\nI'm memorable because of my work ethic, of course they remember me\nThe respect we have for you is only present because we as a culture selfishly kept you alive in our collective memories\nBecause besides that you haven't done anything\nYou're prevalent cause we make your relevant and that's a closed case and a no brainer like JF Kennedy\nI'll bet you a dead president half of these people forgot your name\nBut for our sake, for our sake\n\n{Soul Khan starts laughing}\n\nOh don't laugh, cause yeah, it's okay\nThey probably forgot your name\nBut we still gotta give you a little star on battle rap's Walk Of Fame\nJust not on Hollywood Boulevard, yours would be laid down on Memory Lane\nAnd that's the realest shit anybody's ever wrote about you\nCause you wanna be this voice for the people but your body of work don't add up to what you socially amount to\nI got my crown jewels cause I show and prove strictly off ground moves\nWhile you got a status quo that exists merely cause the people around you\nSubjectively gave it it's value\nDon't you get it? Without us, you don't have you\nAnd without me, they don't have views\nSo without this battle the fans lose\nAnd if you ever question who I am to this scene, I'm everything bitch, THAT'S WHO!\nAnd you the little jokey jokey kid, who only poses a risk (wrist) when he poses like this\nUh oh, I think he's forming a flip\nHe's about to channel the inner Charron from his dick\nHe makes jokes about himself cause that's his only defense\nBut what kind of lack of testosterone is this?\nHe's gon' become some kind of leftist Hollywood director\nI can see it now, workin' on his own little script\nRelaunching new episodes: Soul Khan Presents: Zena The Warrior Prince\nThis guy went from a full blown chauvinist to an emotional bitch\nLook I understand that you regret being so homophobic but you need to get over it quick\nDon't be like Jussie Smollett now and beat yourself up over this shit\nBecause of course you're not homophobic bro, we know that\nCause you're really gay in secret\nLast time you passed out at a frat house they drew a dick on your forehead while you were sleepin'\nAnd the first thing you said when you woke up and peeped it\nWas...\"I'ma keep it.\"\nSo that's all you had? The little homophobic kiss me angle you was gonna come back with?\n\n[Soul Khan] The offer still stands\n\n[Dizaster]\nTo cover up the fact that you were consistently callin' people \"homo\" as one of your habits\nYou wanna know something bro? You know what's really gay?\nWhen they asked you if you had love for battle rap still and you answered back with, \"I don't know if I've ever had it.\"\nSoul Khan in our world, that's the definition of a {beep}\nOf course he gets no passes\nIf he recycles he should be judged like all the MC's\nHe said, \"Oh, I don't know if I can catch up on these battles to know if I'm reusing a bar or a scheme.\"\nBut that's the point dummy, it's pretty much a logical thing\nYou wouldn't have to watch 1,000,000 battles in a row if you actively cared enough to still be a part of the scene\nBut, you wouldn't have to catch up if you were here\nThat's what makes you a foreigner but what does all of this mean?\nIt means you failed as a battle rapper and you failed to go mainstream\nSo now you this lost underground backpacker that's caught in-between\nWanting to make bars or do a song where you sing\nSo Soul Khan you'll always be a man of many Willy Wonka hats but you'll never be the boss of one thing\nSo tell me, what you planning to do with all this you self deprecating Jew apologist?\nI know you're reformed now but to me you're every \"isist\" and \"ologist\" there probably is\nYou made a living off of calling people \"fruit balls\"\nYou're basically a RuPaul-ogist\nAll these things make it all too obvious\nKhan is a true Communist\nBut this is Americana, and what Khan insists on don't make no kinda sense\nWe on some reconnaissance\nYou know who my gang is Khan, don't make me Genghis Khan your shit\nDeath by a thousand cuts, I'll leave him with all kinds of body slits\nWhen the Katina leaves cuts in him deep as the Mariana Trench\nI'm fast as Mayweather, you may die now quick\nPull up on him, Maradona kick\nI'll dangle you from a cedar tree like a pinata then bat you with a fuckin' hockey stick\nAnd keep beatin' your body with it until the candy (w)rapper that's inside of you eventually falls out of it\nI fucking {beep beep beep} take a fuckin' time bomb and shove it down your esophagus\nHave you coughing up blobs of phosphorus\nSince you're a narcissist you shouldn't have a problem when someone makes you swallow your own confidence\nI'll curb stomp this Erin Brockovitch lookin' nerd\nOff of his high horse then drag him by force from his nerdy ass little work offices\nI'll put him in a dirt plot, put the Earth on top of it\nI could put him in a box or a bag but this what he gon' earn (urn) off of this\nA fermented body in a reserved spot in a fully furbished German Sarcophagus\nThis is the most violent Socialist inside your metropolis\nHe wants to strike over politics\nReady to riot outside the White House in Washington\nGetting into a dildo fight with Milo Yiannopoulos\nHe said if it wasn't for the music he might've destroyed all of us\nPssst, well let's look at the ergonomics and purpose of this worthless comment\nYour verses has always been full of meaningless words\nSo no one gives a fuck about your new learning process\nWe never got to see the work in progress\nI'm a murderous terminologist\nA wordsmith and a workaholic\nYou a dirty Socialist that never earned shit but feel like you deserve a profit\nCapital One, tell me what's in your wallet\nYou said you can't focus on battle rap cause music is your obligation\nWell let's contemplate on Khan's template\nLet's spend a moment in a world of Khan's creations\nHis ancestors used to get fucked up in Concentration Camps\nBut he stays with a camp that fucks up his concentration\nIf you ask me, I think Khan is in his own constellation\nHis concept is so convoluted and drawn far outta context\nThat for me it's confirmation, if they ever held a nomination, who had the best content\nThat Khan verse (converse) wouldn't even be in the conversation\nWho does name flips like that?\nHow many concerts has Khan conducted?\nHow many projects has he conjured up or Khan constructed?\nI'll tell y'all...nothing!\nSo of course he gonna talk about my accomplishments\nI fucked up a lot of times, those were the hands I was dealt\nBut you aspire to battle people like Aspire\nSo naturally you'll never understand how battling someone like Canibus or Cassidy felt\nBecause you packed up and left, only to return like Kim Kardashian and make an ass out yourself\nCause what you say? \"I'm done. There's no battlers left.\"\nBut a real battle rapper doesn't beg for no hand outs or never asks for no help\nI'm the man because I became a man that can stand by himself\nAnd you here cause you battling Dizaster, that's it, you don't have nothing else\nI'm on a different level, I single handedly branded myself\nI shouldn't even have to meddle (metal) with these little pussies like a chastity belt\nI'm glad I came down to Oakland to give him this ass whippin'\nHe just panders to the crowd, acts like he cares about black culture\nHe just usin' black culture to push him, he drops one line about civil rights and the whole crowd overlooks him\nBut if you really believe the whites were gentrifying your city you would've moved yourself the fuck outta Brooklyn\nYou are literally an invader on a black man's turf\nAnd you're Jewish which makes it that much worse\nLiterally, you're the problem you're trying to take out\nAnd it's the same way back in the day, the GrindTime situation played out\nYou say, \"R.I.P. PH\", but when he alive you did him like a two faced snake\nLucky for you back then the little dirt never came out\nBut I got the info and then some\nHow he was helping you get some battles back when you couldn't even get your shit done\nHe was giving you views, helping you build them back up when you couldn't get none\nHe even gave you Cortez, that was your biggest name back then\nHe matched you against him\nAnd then as soon as the opportunity to battle on URL comes\nYou left him hanging on his next event, you bailed out and you ditched him\nA straight sucker from the Maze Runner, I wanna see you climb your way outta this one\nMan, ain't no safe house or escape routes, I'm pulling out the big guns, the big ones\nThe type to make Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff run\nAK's with the twin drums\nI call 'em \"Soul Crushers\" [?] scope on top\nYour dome gettin' popped\nI put Soul in a box like Ghostbusters\nY'all remember Ghostbusters?\nDan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, when they trapped Slimmer in that little box in the beginnin'?\nHe's like, \"No. I prefer the Ghostbusters version where they casted the women.\"\nOf course Soul Khan\nAnd I like women, I love women a lot\nBut what type of women are you talking about?\nThe ones that take photos for King Of The Dot?\nWhoa, it looks like we're going straight to the source\nOh well, I guess Soul Khan is only here now because he's going through a really rough divorce\nAnd it's funny because, he come in here like he has this master plan\nOh, but y'all don't understand this fam'\nThat no matter how you slice it, we lookin' at a queenless person, this is half a man\nHe's a- half of the king he used to be, he has half of his throne\nHalf of his belongings and only half of what he owns\nSo you can talk about my marriage, I'm happily married, I don't have a problem letting that shit be known\nI'd rather be that than this fuckin' depressed little fuckin' bachelor that doesn't have a home\nBehind this fuckin' feminist curtain there's a man that's sad and alone\nHe wanted to make all the women in the world happy but he couldn't even make his own woman happy at home\nAnd she gone now\nAin't no tellin' what ya ex-bitch might do\nHe said he wants to be a black man for the activist\nHe just mad his white ass found out his wife does too\nBut hold on to hope Soul Khan your dreams might come true\nIf she really your Soul mate\nThen wait nine years and maybe she'll make a comeback just like you\nAnd he thought I was gonna have 6,000,000 Jew jokes like I was gonna talk about Hitler\nWhen he's wasted ten years of his life with a photographer chick and he still doesn't get the picture\nOr maybe he does, and the rest is just numb\nCause the relationship dipped into a dark room and eventually developed into a negative one\nRumor is, after you got married, you stopped battling cause she didn't let you\nWhich is ironic cause your timing of coming back is soon as she left you\nYou need to face the music, she left you naked and made you look stupid\nBut hey, in a way she was perfect for you cause she ended up walking away from the ring the same way that you did\nThat shit is oh so cold\nShe walked in and she told you go\nI don't know man, it sounds like she signed a record deal or something cause that chick really sold her Soul\nMaybe it's because you're always going on about Trump\nTrump this, Trump that\nTrump he did this\nRepublican that\nGovernment that, government this\nAlways up in somebody's mix\nTo the point he left no attention to the special someone he's with\nWhat part of this doesn't he get?\nYour wife left you because of this shit\nProbably had enough of you running your lip\nThen she's probably out there right now aggressively suckin' some Republican's dick\nAnd that's just the hypothetical, here's where we cause the most damage\nI'm really sorry about this ammo cause this shit gon' get volcanic\nCause it's ahh kinda ahh, I kinda heard before she wanted to be with you she wanted to be with Organik\nOh man, and that's the bro Travis\nWhen he asked you for this battle, he was like, \"Bro have it.\"\nSame way he answered you when you asked about her\nHe was like, \"Bro have it.\"\nOh man, oh fuckin' dammit\nI don't even like getting this personal, these are your tactics\nYou the one that brought up QP's baby mama\nHis son, his child support and his taxes\nYou the fuckin' one that brought up Sandusky versus Rone cause you felt like it would be so savage\nYou the one that brought up Real Deal's son in not one, but multiple matches\nSo spare me this victim bullshit, cause your karma here is solely from the role that you practice\nNow onto our parents\nYou know how mad I get when people talk about my parents\nOh man\nOh man\nNow, what about our parents bro?\nHuh? What about our parents?\nMy mom....is a math teacher\nAnd your mom is a librarian\n\n[Soul Khan] Clerk\n\n[Dizaster]\nLibrarian clerk\nBut why are we comparing them?\nBecause women teachers? They queens, they deserve all the praise\nMinimum wage they deserve all the raise\nThey the most underappreciated in a way\nThen comes your mom\nSitting behind a desk, stamping books, twiddling her thumbs all day\nA library clerk, that's why her son came out into books like a nerd\nThat's where the mother/son similarities occur\nCause my mother is a math teacher...and I came out to be a Math teacher just like her\nNow hold on\nLet me talk about my dad since everybody wants to talk about him\nMy father's dad passed away when my dad was only 19\nAlright? His name was Bachir just like me\nHe had three younger brothers, and a little sister\nSo now forced to raise them on his own, he had no chance but to look for a bigger picture\nIn 1976, my pops saved up and bought his first car\nHad it on top of the hill, just parked on it, and that's when the civil war got started\nA dude named Michel Aoun and the Christian Armed Forces dropped a bomb on it\nNow when I say \"Christian\", y'all assume that I'm Muslim, right?\nBut I'm Druze, I'm not Muslim\nBut I loved them, they my brothers\nBut back then, we was in a holy land grab over religion\nA world driven by sectarianism\nYou wouldn't the meaning of a fucked up system\nThe people where I'm from will die to live where you live in\nTo eat the food that you eat to sip the water you drink\nAnd that's the reason you saw me protesting\nBut since you a spoiled little American brat\nI'ma explain America to you through my eyes to teach you this lesson\nNow let's go back to the 70's where I left you in that last scene\nWhere Michel Aoun blew up my father's car in front of our house in Baakleen\nNow this is where he knew he had to leave if he was to expand the family tree\nBut life there was lookin' hopeless\nSo the only place that could've gave us this life was the Land Of The Free\nThis is why I love America\nBecause my dad came here to build a path just for me\nAnd after that, he went bankrupt and we moved permanently\nThose next eight years would make me everything that I am\nIn the street, playing soccer, bare feet, kickin' the can\nIn the fuckin' mud 'til the sun came down, shit that really turned a kid to a man\nBut that was when you were in Woodland Hills with this little Gameboy in ya hand\nSo you wouldn't really understand would you?\nYeah, cause all we had was to be able to go out and play\nBut as Lebanese kids we were taught to be appreciative that in a way\nEven though all we had was cold showers most of the time and four hours of electricity during the day\nI lived through this shit\nAnd through the rest of my settlement, my country would be going through this development\nNow listen, you remember how I said the dude that blew up my dad's car in the first segment?\nOkay, this is why the whole thing is relevant\nThis is the reason I said the shit\nCause that same person, 30 years later has now been elected as our president\nWe're talking about somebody who's a political war criminal who executed thousands by his hand\nHe's killed everything I love and that's the reason I wave this flag\nYou hate the president of America because I understand\nHis policies make you mad\nHe's a goof, I know, the Tweets make you sad\nBut guess what\nI hate my president because he fuckin' broke up half my nation and damn near took away my dad\nAnd listen, this is real shit\nThey wanna start a holy war with Muslims, Druze and Christians\nBut I will never go back to the ways that are old tradition\nI would rather go over there and die with them then fight with them\nThose are my brothers those are my sisters\nI look at them like they my children\nNow listen, I understand there's inequality here towards blacks in this system\nThat has nothing to do with him\nI don't care how he sees the views if they've never been used against him\nSo for what it's worth, you right, I'm not Muslim\nI am Druze, alright?\nDo you know what that means?\nThat means we are under Walid Jumblatt, we are Socialist by birth\nThat means, I can tell you firsthand that we're supposed to be the most peaceful people on Earth\nI mean, we're supposed to be peaceful at birth\nBut if you push us we can be some of the most fuckin' violent people on Earth\nAnd the point being, is that you're a fuckin' wanna-be Socialist\nYou don't know what you're screwing with\nSocialism is in my fucking bloodline and I want nothing to do with it\nBecause I know first hand bro\nTrust me, I've lived under this Socialist government shit\nI'll tell you first hand that nothing gets fixed\nThe garbage doesn't even get picked up, no one gives a fuck about shit\nBut you wouldn't understand because you an inexperienced, uncultured son of a bitch\nThis ain't about the joke you living or the votes you gettin' in the real world people carry guns then die over Socialism\nYou want us to live in this global prison\nWhere we take orders from these fuckin' old tradition senior citizens\nThat are four times older than him\nSo the main point, you ain't never been through nothing like this\nAnd go back to what we were saying on our parents\nAlright? This is what it means to be a Lebanese-American\nIt's the journey it's where we came from and where our parents been\nSo since you think you gon' talk about my parents I'ma use my own parents to embarrass him\nBack to when we was talkin' about your mom being a librarian\nBut let's go to your dad now\nYou heard my dad's story, oh you ready\nYou heard my pop's story, his struggle was hard\nHe came here and turned an emotional scar and made himself to a star\nAnd I'm following in his footsteps\nWhich proves your pops is always a reflection of who you are\nBut what about your dad?\n\n[Soul Khan] He was a piece of shit\n\n[Dizaster]\nWell he was a lawyer, and that could be respected\nBut then what happened? He lost his bar\nAnd became an unemployed fucking loser taking business calls from his car\nWait a minute, that's not all\nHe was a musician like you, he wanted to top the charts\nHe thought it'd go far\nHibbity har har har\nAnd just like you, I doubt you'll make a career out of this ever\nSince you're admitting he's a shitty role model, then let me spend the rest of this to teach you how to do better\nYour pops at 19 got a deal with Capitol Records\nCompared to what happened to my dad at 19 that's substantially better\nLike way better\nBut then what happened?\nHe got dropped before he could put out any records\nAnd he was being managed by Phil Spector!\nLike- that's The Beatles manager, like how fuckin' bad can you be\nLike this is where your fuckin' personalities connect accurately\nBecause you both went to New York to become the man you could be\nI guess it's true what they say, the Big Apple doesn't fall far from the family tree\nAw man, everything about you is what makes you such a lame ass loser\nI'm too advanced\nThis like a cave man with his tools to a space man with a computer\nA space man with a computer-\nWait a minute\nFuck it, you wanna know what the fuckin' joke was about?\nSo who guessed the riddle I was putting out?\nLucy, a drug dealer with a hangover\nCoco, you plus me equals...human\nCousins, Caesar\nWhat are these names of?\nEvolution, primates\nSo to clear up the confusion\nThis about to be rebuttaled to everything he just said about the evolution\nNow, first of all, on the evolutionary chart\nOur most common oldest ancestor on Earth would be Lucy\nNow Lucy, is our oldest ancestor\nTechnically, like a human fused with an animal\nBy battle rap standards, that would be the beginning for us; Juice vs. Supernatural\nNow most of our class, evolved from that\nThose are the ancestors that both connect us\nAnd then there's you on the evolutionary chart\nOutta nowhere with the gay jokes\nYou would be...you would be homoerectus\nNow the anatomy of homoerectus...anatomy wise they were flat and small\nThey were loud, they had tiny hands, they were small\nThey had no balls and that was all\nThey thrived during the GrindTime Era, pay attention\nThis is gonna get crazy\nThey thrived during the GrindTime Era\nAlong with the emergence of a new group of hominids\nThose were called the Neanderthals\nThe GrindTime white guys\nPredominantly white, they felt like they had it all\nThey came into the game as giants which allowed them to stand up tall\nBut eventually their lack of culture will allow them to succumb to a massive fall\nWhich predicated the rise of the Cro Magnon man\nWe're movin' along the chart\nThe Cro Magnon man, in our standards that would be the URL rapper, the Chrome Magnum Man\nNow ironically enough, this the first man to use the tools\nAnd everything was cool\nBut eventually they couldn't come up with anything new\nAnd they hit the ceiling limit of their genetic pool\nThen comes the final transformation into today's modern homosapiens\nMe\nLux, Mook, Pat, Illmac, The Saurus, ICE, Goodz, Shine\nPeople that been here for generations\nAnd most of them branched way out through these changes\nIncluding me, I went through every single one of these evolutionary changes\nHold wait, that's why I got it down to a mathematic perfection\nCause now I'm giving you a timeline which is an accurate projection of where we had this connection\nAnd where we last left off at the last intersection\nCause you had no battles left, so it threw a monkey wrench in what was then your rapid progression\nWhich then lead you to get wiped out by natural selection\nDo I know about evolution? Maybe\nNow, this is where you learn something new here\nCause evolution ain't the only thing that I can do\nWe almost done, I need you to focus with me we're waaay past half way here, we're almost at the end\nWe at the end, we way past half way here\nI'm gonna need some crowd participation, are you guys awake here?\n{Crowd cheers}\nAlright, pull out your phones right now\nAnd trust me, I got all day, I could stay here\nGoogle \"Infinite Monkey\"\nTell me what that say here\n\n[Guy in the crowd]\n\"A monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for infinite about of time will surely complete works of William Shakespeare\n\n[Dizaster]\nWilliam Shakespeare\nOoh, that's another picture I put out, the sixth clue\nThey say if a infinite amount of monkeys type on an infinite amount of typewriters in an infinite amount of universes\nThey should be able to replicate the work of Shakespeare\nBut later on this theory would disprove itself\nAnd actually say that, for that to be possible the probability of it is the closest number to zero\nAnd this is why me and  you will never be equal\nThis is what separates us from monkeys as people\nBecause you see, even if you took a million, trillion infinite Soul Khans in a trillion trillion universes\nYou will never be able to truly replicate the truest purpose of this human's verses\nAnd that's why I made this\nTo let you know that you could never reach me\nI became an advanced being in this and you will always be that fuckin' monkey underneath me\nPussy\nTIME!Embed"}, {"name": "Strawberry Fields Forever", "artist": "The Beatles", "lyrics": "Strawberry Fields Forever Lyrics[Chorus]\nLet me take you down, 'cause I'm going to\nStrawberry Fields\nNothing is real\nAnd nothing to get hung about\nStrawberry Fields forever\n\n[Verse 1]\nLiving is easy with eyes closed\nMisunderstanding all you see\nIt's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out\nIt doesn't matter much to me\n[Chorus]\nLet me take you down, 'cause I'm going to\nStrawberry Fields\nNothing is real\nAnd nothing to get hung about\nStrawberry Fields forever\n[Verse 2]\nNo one I think is in my tree\nI mean, it must be high or low\nThat is, you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right\nThat is, I think it's not too bad\n\n[Chorus]\nLet me take you down, 'cause I'm going to\nStrawberry Fields\nNothing is real\nAnd nothing to get hung about\nStrawberry Fields forever\n\n[Verse 3]\nAlways, no, sometimes think it's me\nBut you know, I know when it's a dream\nI think I know, I mean\u2014er\u2014yes, but it's all wrong\nThat is, I think I disagree\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nLet me take you down, 'cause I'm going to\nStrawberry Fields\nNothing is real\nAnd nothing to get hung about\nStrawberry Fields forever\nStrawberry Fields forever\nStrawberry Fields forever\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Outro]\nCranberry sauce52Embed"}, {"name": "Lost!", "artist": "Coldplay", "lyrics": "Translations\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940Lost!

pretty, tell me your name\nIs it out of line if I were simply bold and say \"Would you be mine?\"\nBecause I may be a beggar and you may be the queen\nI know I may be on a downer, I'm still ready to dream\nThough it's three o'clock, the time is just the time it takes for you to talk\n\n[Chorus 1]\nSo if you're lonely, why'd you say you're not lonely?\nOh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so\nIt's just like you to come and go\nAnd know me, no, you don't even know me\nYou're so sweet to try, oh my, you caught my eye\nA girl like you is just irresistible\n[Verse 2]\nWell it's a big, big city and the lights are all out\nBut it's as much as I can do you know to figure you out\nAnd I must confess, my heart's in broken pieces and my head's a mess\nAnd it's four in the morning and I'm walking along\nBeside the ghost of every drinker here who's ever done wrong\nAnd it's you, woo-hoo, that's got me going crazy for the things you do\n\n[Chorus 2]\nSo if you're crazy, I don't care, you amaze me\nBut you're a stupid girl, oh me, oh my, you talk\nI die, you smile, you laugh, I cry\nAnd only, a girl like you could be lonely\nAnd it's a crying shame, if you would think the same\nA boy like me is just irresistible\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Chorus 1]\nSo if you're lonely, why'd you say you're not lonely?\nOh you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so\nIt's just like you to come and

throned on ocean's wave\nIt blushes o'er the world;\nYet both so passing wonderful!\n\nHath then the gloomy Power\nWhose reign is in the tainted sepulchres 10\nSeized on her sinless soul?\nMust then that peerless form\nWhich love and admiration cannot view\nWithout a beating heart, those azure veins\nWhich steal like streams along a field of snow,\nThat lovely outline which is fair\nAs breathing marble, perish?\nMust putrefaction's breath\nLeave nothing of this heavenly sight\nBut loathsomeness and ruin? 20\nSpare nothing but a gloomy theme,\nOn which the lightest heart might moralize?\nOr is it only a sweet slumber\nStealing o'er sensation,\nWhich the breath of roseate morning\nChaseth into darkness?\nWill Ianthe wake again,\nAnd give that faithful bosom joy\nWhose sleepless spirit waits to catch\nLight, life and rapture, from her smile? 30\nYes! she will wake again,\nAlthough her glowing limbs are motionless,\nAnd silent those sweet lips,\nOnce breathing eloquence\nThat might have soothed a tiger's rage\nOr thawed the cold heart of a conqueror.\nHer dewy eyes are closed,\nAnd on their lids, whose texture fine\nScarce hides the dark blue orbs beneath,\nThe baby Sleep is pillowed; 40\nHer golden tresses shade\nThe bosom's stainless pride,\nCurling like tendrils of the parasite\nAround a marble column.\n\nHark! whence that rushing sound?\n'T is like the wondrous strain\nThat round a lonely ruin swells,\nWhich, wandering on the echoing shore,\nThe enthusiast hears at evening;\n'T is softer than the west wind's sigh; 50\n'T is wilder than the unmeasured notes\nOf that strange lyre whose strings\nThe genii of the breezes sweep;\nThose lines of rainbow light\nAre like the moonbeams when they fall\nThrough some cathedral window, but the tints\nAre such as may not find\nComparison on earth.\nBehold the chariot of the Fairy Queen!\nCelestial coursers paw the unyielding air; 60\nTheir filmy pennons at her word they furl,\nAnd stop obedient to the reins of light;\nThese the Queen of Spells drew in;\nShe spread a charm around the spot,\nAnd, leaning graceful from the ethereal car,\nLong did she gaze, and silently,\nUpon the slumbering maid.\n\nOh! not the visioned poet in his dreams,\nWhen silvery clouds float through the wildered brain,\nWhen every sight of lovely, wild and grand 70\nAstonishes, enraptures, elevates,\nWhen fancy at a glance combines\nThe wondrous and the beautiful,--\nSo bright, so fair, so wild a shape\nHath ever yet beheld,\nAs that which reined the coursers of the air\nAnd poured the magic of her gaze\nUpon the maiden's sleep.\n\nThe broad and yellow moon\nShone dimly through her form-- 80\nThat form of faultless symmetry;\nThe pearly and pellucid car\nMoved not the moonlight's line.\n'T was not an earthly pageant.\nThose, who had looked upon the sight\nPassing all human glory,\nSaw not the yellow moon,\nSaw not the mortal scene,\nHeard not the night-wind's rush,\nHeard not an earthly sound, 90\nSaw but the fairy pageant,\nHeard but the heavenly strains\nThat filled the lonely dwelling.\nThe Fairy's frame was slight--yon fibrous cloud,\nThat catches but the palest tinge of even,\nAnd which the straining eye can hardly seize\nWhen melting into eastern twilight's shadow,\nWere scarce so thin, so slight; but the fair star\nThat gems the glittering coronet of morn,\nSheds not a light so mild, so powerful, 100\nAs that which, bursting from the Fairy's form,\nSpread a purpureal halo round the scene,\nYet with an undulating motion,\nSwayed to her outline gracefully.\n\nFrom her celestial car\nThe Fairy Queen descended,\nAnd thrice she waved her wand\nCircled with wreaths of amaranth;\nHer thin and misty form\nMoved with the moving air, 110\nAnd the clear silver tones,\nAs thus she spoke, were such\nAs are unheard by all but gifted ear.\n\nFAIRY\n'Stars! your balmiest influence shed!\nElements! your wrath suspend!\nSleep, Ocean, in the rocky bounds\nThat circle thy domain!\nLet not a breath be seen to stir\nAround yon grass-grown ruin's height!\nLet even the restless gossamer 120\nSleep on the moveless air!\nSoul of Ianthe! thou,\nJudged alone worthy of the envied boon\nThat waits the good and the sincere; that waits\nThose who have struggled, and with resolute will\nVanquished earth's pride and meanness, burst the chains,\nThe icy chains of custom, and have shone\nThe day-stars of their age;--Soul of\nIanthe!\nAwake! arise!'\n\nSudden arose 130\nIanthe's Soul; it stood\nAll beautiful in naked purity,\nThe perfect semblance of its bodily frame;\nInstinct with inexpressible beauty and grace--\nEach stain of earthliness\nHad passed away--it reassumed\nIts native dignity and stood\nImmortal amid ruin.\n\nUpon the couch the body lay,\nWrapt in the depth of slumber; 140\nIts features were fixed and meaningless,\nYet animal life was there,\nAnd every organ yet performed\nIts natural functions; 'twas a sight\nOf wonder to behold the body and the soul.\nThe self-same lineaments, the same\nMarks of identity were there;\nYet, oh, how different! One aspires to Heaven,\nPants for its sempiternal heritage,\nAnd, ever changing, ever rising still, 150\nWantons in endless being:\nThe other, for a time the unwilling sport\nOf circumstance and passion, struggles on;\nFleets through its sad duration rapidly;\nThen like an useless and worn-out machine,\nRots, perishes, and passes.\n\nFAIRY\n'Spirit! who hast dived so deep;\nSpirit! who hast soared so high;\nThou the fearless, thou the mild,\nAccept the boon thy worth hath earned, 160\nAscend the car with me!'\n\nSPIRIT\n'Do I dream?

here--\nIn this interminable wilderness\nOf worlds, at whose immensity\nEven soaring fancy staggers,\nHere is thy fitting temple!\nYet not the lightest leaf\nThat quivers to the passing breeze 270\nIs less instinct with thee;\nYet not the meanest worm\nThat lurks in graves and fattens on the dead,\nLess shares thy eternal breath!\nSpirit of Nature! thou,\nImperishable as this scene--\nHere is thy fitting temple!\n\nII\nIf solitude hath ever led thy steps\nTo the wild ocean's echoing shore,\nAnd thou hast lingered there,\nUntil the sun's broad orb\nSeemed resting on the burnished wave,\nThou must have marked the lines\nOf purple gold that motionless\nHung o'er the sinking sphere;\nThou must have marked the billowy clouds,\nEdged with intolerable radiancy, 10\nTowering like rocks of jet\nCrowned with a diamond wreath;\nAnd yet there is a moment,\nWhen the sun's highest point\nPeeps like a star o'er ocean's western edge,\nWhen those far clouds of feathery gold,\nShaded with deepest purple, gleam\nLike islands on a dark blue sea;\nThen has thy fancy soared above the earth\nAnd furled its wearied wing 20\nWithin the Fairy's fane.\n\nYet not the golden islands\nGleaming in yon flood of light,\nNor the feathery curtains\nStretching o'er the sun's bright couch,\nNor the burnished ocean-waves\nPaving that gorgeous dome,\nSo fair, so wonderful a sight\nAs Mab's ethereal palace could afford.\nYet likest evening's vault, that fa\u00ebry Hall! 30\nAs Heaven, low resting on the wave, it spread\nIts floors of flashing light,\nIts vast and azure dome,\nIts fertile golden islands\nFloating on a silver sea;\nWhilst suns their mingling beamings darted\nThrough clouds of circumambient darkness,\nAnd pearly battlements around\nLooked o'er the immense of Heaven.\n\nThe magic car no longer moved. 40\nThe Fairy and the Spirit\nEntered the Hall of Spells.\nThose golden clouds\nThat rolled in glittering billows\nBeneath the azure canopy,\nWith the ethereal footsteps trembled not;\nThe light and crimson mists,\nFloating to strains of thrilling melody\nThrough that unearthly dwelling,\nYielded to every movement of the will; 50\nUpon their passive swell the Spirit leaned,\nAnd, for the varied bliss that pressed around,\nUsed not the glorious privilege\nOf virtue and of wisdom.\n\n'Spirit!' the Fairy said,\nAnd pointed to the gorgeous dome,\n'This is a wondrous sight\nAnd mocks all human grandeur;\nBut, were it virtue's only meed to dwell\nIn a celestial palace, all resigned 60\nTo pleasurable impulses, immured\nWithin the prison of itself, the will\nOf changeless Nature would be unfulfilled.\nLearn to make others happy. Spirit, come!\nThis is thine high reward:--the past shall rise;\nThou shalt behold the present; I will teach\nThe secrets of the future.'\n\nThe Fairy and the Spirit\nApproached the overhanging battlement.\nBelow lay stretched the universe! 70\nThere, far as the remotest line\nThat bounds imagination's flight,\nCountless and unending orbs\nIn mazy motion intermingled,\nYet still fulfilled immutably\nEternal Nature's law.\nAbove, below, around,\nThe circling systems formed\nA wilderness of harmony;\nEach with undeviating aim, 80\nIn eloquent silence, through the depths of space\nPursued its wondrous way.\n\nThere was a little light\nThat twinkled in the misty distance.\nNone but a spirit's eye\nMight ken that rolling orb.\nNone but a spirit's eye,\nAnd in no other place\nBut that celestial dwelling, might behold\nEach action of this earth's inhabitants. 90\nBut matter, space, and time,\nIn those a\u00ebrial mansions cease to act;\nAnd all-prevailing wisdom, when it reaps\nThe harvest of its excellence, o'erbounds\nThose obstacles of which an earthly soul\nFears to attempt the conquest.\n\nThe Fairy pointed to the earth.\nThe Spirit's intellectual eye\nIts kindred beings recognized.\nThe thronging thousands, to a passing view, 100\nSeemed like an ant-hill's citizens.\nHow wonderful! that even\nThe passions, prejudices, interests,\nThat sway the meanest being--the weak touch\nThat moves the finest nerve\nAnd in one human brain\nCauses the faintest thought, becomes a link\nIn the great chain of Nature!\n\n'Behold,' the Fairy cried,\n'Palmyra's ruined palaces! 110\nBehold where grandeur frowned!\nBehold where pleasure smiled!\nWhat now remains?--the memory\nOf senselessness and shame.\nWhat is immortal there?\nNothing--it stands to tell\nA melancholy tale, to give\nAn awful warning; soon\nOblivion will steal silently\nThe remnant of its fame. 120\nMonarchs and conquerors there\nProud o'er prostrate millions trod--\nThe earthquakes of the human race;\nLike them, forgotten when the ruin\nThat marks their shock is past.\n\n'Beside the eternal Nile\nThe Pyramids have risen.\nNile shall pursue his changeless way;\nThose Pyramids shall fall.\nYea! not a stone shall stand to tell 130\nThe spot whereon they stood;\nTheir very site shall be forgotten,\nAs is their builder's name!\n\n'Behold yon sterile spot,\nWhere now the wandering Arab's tent\nFlaps in the desert blast!\nThere once old Salem's haughty fane\nReared high to heaven its thousand golden domes,\nAnd in the blushing face of day\nExposed its shameful glory. 140\nOh! many a widow, many an orphan cursed\nThe building of that fane; and many a father,\nWorn out with toil and slavery, implored\nThe poor man's God to sweep it from the earth\nAnd spare his children the detested task\nOf piling stone on stone and poisoning\nThe choicest days of life\nTo soothe a dotard's vanity.\nThere an inhuman and uncultured race\nHowled hideous praises to their Demon-God; 150\nThey rushed to war, tore from the mother's womb\nThe unborn child--old age and infancy\nPromiscuous perished; their victorious arms\nLeft not a soul to breathe. Oh! they were fiends!\nBut what was he who taught them that the God\nOf Nature and benevolence had given\nA special sanction to the trade of blood?\nHis name and theirs are fading, and the tales\nOf this barbarian nation, which imposture\nRecites till terror credits, are pursuing 160\nItself into forgetfulness.\n\n'Where Athens, Rome, and Sparta stood,\nThere is a moral desert now.\nThe mean and miserable huts,\nThe yet more wretched palaces,\nContrasted with those ancient fanes\nNow crumbling to oblivion,--\nThe long and lonely colonnades\nThrough which the ghost of Freedom stalks,--\nSeem like a well-known tune, 170\nWhich in some dear scene we have loved to hear,\nRemembered now in sadness.\nBut, oh! how much more changed,\nHow gloomier is the contrast\nOf human nature there!\nWhere Socrates expired, a tyrant's slave,\nA coward and a fool, spreads death around--\nThen, shuddering, meets his own.\nWhere Cicero and Antoninus lived,\nA cowled and hypocritical monk 180\nPrays, curses and deceives.\n\n'Spirit! ten thousand years\nHave scarcely passed away,\nSince in the waste, where now the savage drinks\nHis enemy's blood, and, aping Europe's sons,\nWakes the unholy song of war,\nArose a stately city,\nMetropolis of the western continent.\nThere, now, the mossy column-stone,\nIndented by time's unrelaxing grasp, 190\nWhich once appeared to brave\nAll, save its country's ruin,--\nThere the wide forest scene,\nRude in the uncultivated loveliness\nOf gardens long run wild,--\nSeems, to the unwilling sojourner whose steps\nChance in that desert has delayed,\nThus to have stood since earth was what it is.\nYet once it was the busiest haunt,\nWhither, as to a common centre, flocked 200\nStrangers, and ships, and merchandise;\nOnce peace and freedom blest\nThe cultivated plain;\nBut wealth, that curse of man,\nBlighted the bud of its prosperity;\nVirtue and wisdom, truth and liberty,\nFled, to return not, until man shall know\nThat they alone can give the bliss\nWorthy a soul that claims\nIts kindred with eternity. 210\n\n'There 's not one atom of yon earth\nBut once was living man;\nNor the minutest drop of rain,\nThat hangeth in its thinnest cloud,\nBut flowed in human veins;\nAnd from the burning plains\nWhere Libyan monsters yell,\nFrom the most gloomy glens\nOf Greenland's sunless clime,\nTo where the golden fields 220\nOf fertile England spread\nTheir harvest to the day,\nThou canst not find one spot\nWhereon no city stood.\n\n'How strange is human pride!\nI tell thee that those living things,\nTo whom the fragile blade of grass\nThat springeth in the morn\nAnd perisheth ere noon,\nIs an unbounded world; 230\nI tell thee that those viewless beings,\nWhose mansion is the smallest particle\nOf the impassive atmosphere,\nThink, feel and live like man;\nThat their affections and antipathies,\nLike his, produce the laws\nRuling their moral state;\nAnd the minutest throb\nThat through their frame diffuses\nThe slightest, faintest motion, 240\nIs fixed and indispensable\nAs the majestic laws\nThat rule yon rolling orbs.'\n\nThe Fairy paused. The Spirit,\nIn ecstasy of admiration, felt\nAll knowledge of the past revived; the events\nOf old and wondrous times,\nWhich dim tradition interruptedly\nTeaches the credulous vulgar, were unfolded\nIn just perspective to the view; 250\nYet dim from their infinitude.\nThe Spirit seemed to stand\nHigh on an isolated pinnacle;\nThe flood of ages combating below,\nThe depth of the unbounded universe\nAbove, and all around\nNature's unchanging harmony.\n\nIII\n'Fairy!' the Spirit said,\nAnd on the Queen of Spells\nFixed her ethereal eyes,\n'I thank thee. Thou hast given\nA boon which I will not resign, and taught\nA lesson not to be unlearned. I know\nThe past, and thence I will essay to glean\nA warning for the future, so that man\nMay profit by his errors and derive\nExperience from his folly; 10\nFor, when the power of imparting joy\nIs equal to the will, the human soul\nRequires no other heaven.'\n\nMAB\n'Turn thee, surpassing Spirit!\nMuch yet remains unscanned.\nThou knowest how great is man,\nThou knowest his imbecility;\nYet learn thou what he is;\nYet learn the lofty destiny\nWhich restless Time prepares 20\nFor every living soul.\n\n'Behold a gorgeous palace that amid\nYon populous city rears its thousand towers\nAnd seems itself a city. Gloomy troops\nOf sentinels in stern and silent ranks\nEncompass it around; the dweller there\nCannot be free and happy; hearest thou not\nThe curses of the fatherless, the groans\nOf those who have no friend? He passes on--\nThe King, the wearer of a gilded chain 30\nThat binds his soul to abjectness, the fool\nWhom courtiers nickname monarch, whilst a slave\nEven to the basest appetites--that man\nHeeds not the shriek of penury; he smiles\nAt the deep curses which the destitute\nMutter in secret, and a sullen joy\nPervades his bloodless heart when thousands groan\nBut for those morsels which his wantonness\nWastes in unjoyous revelry, to save\nAll that they love from famine; when he hears 40\nThe tale of horror, to some ready-made face\nOf hypocritical assent he turns,\nSmothering the glow of shame, that, spite of him,\nFlushes his bloated cheek.\n\nNow to the meal\nOf silence, grandeur and excess he drags\nHis palled unwilling appetite. If gold,\nGleaming around, and numerous viands culled\nFrom every clime could force the loathing sense\nTo overcome satiety,--if wealth\nThe spring it draws from poisons not,--or vice, 50\nUnfeeling, stubborn vice, converteth not\nIts food to deadliest venom; then that king\nIs happy; and the peasant who fulfils\nHis unforced task, when he returns at even\nAnd by the blazing fagot meets again\nHer welcome for whom all his toil is sped,\nTastes not a sweeter meal.\n\nBehold him now\nStretched on the gorgeous couch; his fevered brain\nReels dizzily awhile; but ah! too soon\nThe slumber of intemperance subsides, 60\nAnd conscience, that undying serpent, calls\nHer venomous brood to their nocturnal task.\nListen! he speaks! oh! mark that frenzied eye--\nOh! mark that deadly visage!'\n\nKING\n'No cessation!\nOh! must this last forever! Awful death,\nI wish, yet fear to clasp thee!--Not one moment\nOf dreamless sleep! O dear and bless\u00e8d Peace,\nWhy dost thou shroud thy vestal purity\nIn penury and dungeons? Wherefore lurkest\nWith danger, death, and solitude; yet shun'st 70\nThe palace I have built thee? Sacred Peace!\nOh, visit me but once,--but pitying shed\nOne drop of balm upon my withered soul!'\n\nTHE FAIRY\n'Vain man! that palace is the virtuous heart,\nAnd Peace defileth not her snowy robes\nIn such a shed as thine. Hark! yet he mutters;\nHis slumbers are but varied agonies;\nThey prey like scorpions on the springs of life.\nThere needeth not the hell that bigots frame\nTo punish those who err; earth in itself 80\nContains at once the evil and the cure;\nAnd all-sufficing Nature can chastise\nThose who transgress her law; she only knows\nHow justly to proportion to the fault\nThe punishment it merits.\n\nIs it strange\nThat this poor wretch should pride him in his woe?\nTake pleasure in his abjectness, and hug\nThe scorpion that consumes him? Is it strange\nThat, placed on a conspicuous throne of thorns,\nGrasping an iron sceptre, and immured 90\nWithin a splendid prison whose stern bounds\nShut him from all that's good or dear on earth,\nHis soul asserts not its humanity?\nThat man's mild nature rises not in war\nAgainst a king's employ? No--'tis not strange.\nHe, like the vulgar, thinks, feels, acts, and lives\nJust as his father did; the unconquered powers\nOf precedent and custom interpose\nBetween a king and virtue. Stranger yet,\nTo those who know not Nature nor deduce 100\nThe future from the present, it may seem,\nThat not one slave, who suffers from the crimes\nOf this unnatural being, not one wretch,\nWhose children famish and whose nuptial bed\nIs earth's unpitying bosom, rears an arm\nTo dash him from his throne!\n\nThose gilded flies\nThat, basking in the sunshine of a court,\nFatten on its corruption! what are they?--\nThe drones of the community; they feed\nOn the mechanic's labor; the starved hind 110\nFor them compels the stubborn glebe to yield\nIts unshared harvests; and yon squalid form,\nLeaner than fleshless misery, that wastes\nA sunless life in the unwholesome mine,\nDrags out in labor a protracted death\nTo glut their grandeur; many faint with toil\nThat few may know the cares and woe of sloth.\n\nWhence, thinkest thou, kings and parasites arose?\nWhence that unnatural line of drones who heap\nToil and unvanquishable penury 120\nOn those who build their palaces and bring\nTheir daily bread?--From vice, black loathsome vice;\nFrom rapine, madness, treachery, and wrong;\nFrom all that genders misery, and makes\nOf earth this thorny wilderness; from lust,\nRevenge, and murder.--And when reason's voice,\nLoud as the voice of Nature, shall have waked\nThe nations; and mankind perceive that vice\nIs discord, war and misery; that virtue\nIs peace and happiness and harmony; 130\nWhen man's maturer nature shall disdain\nThe playthings of its childhood;--kingly glare\nWill lose its power to dazzle, its authority\nWill silently pass by; the gorgeous throne\nShall stand unnoticed in the regal hall,\nFast falling to decay; whilst falsehood's trade\nShall be as hateful and unprofitable\nAs that of truth is now.\n\nWhere is the fame\nWhich the vain-glorious mighty of the earth\nSeek to eternize? Oh! the faintest sound 140\nFrom time's light footfall, the minutest wave\nThat swells the flood of ages, whelms in nothing\nThe unsubstantial bubble. Ay! to-day\nStern is the tyrant's mandate, red the gaze\nThat flashes desolation, strong the arm\nThat scatters multitudes. To-morrow comes!\nThat mandate is a thunder-peal that died\nIn ages past; that gaze, a transient flash\nOn which the midnight closed; and on that arm\nThe worm has made his meal.\n\nThe virtuous man, 150\nWho, great in his humility as kings\nAre little in their grandeur; he who leads\nInvincibly a life of resolute good\nAnd stands amid the silent dungeon-depths\nMore free and fearless than the trembling judge\nWho, clothed in venal power, vainly strove\nTo bind the impassive spirit;--when he falls,\nHis mild eye beams benevolence no more;\nWithered the hand outstretched but to relieve;\nSunk reason's simple eloquence that rolled 160\nBut to appall the guilty. Yes! the grave\nHath quenched that eye and death's relentless frost\nWithered that arm; but the unfading fame\nWhich virtue hangs upon its votary's tomb,\nThe deathless memory of that man whom kings\nCall to their minds and tremble, the remembrance\nWith which the happy spirit contemplates\nIts well-spent pilgrimage on earth,\nShall never pass away.\n\n'Nature rejects the monarch, not the man; 170\nThe subject, not the citizen; for kings\nAnd subjects, mutual foes, forever play\nA losing game into each other's hands,\nWhose stakes are vice and misery. The man\nOf virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys.\nPower, like a desolating pestilence,\nPollutes whate'er it touches; and obedience,\nBane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth,\nMakes slaves of men, and of the human frame\nA mechanized automaton.\n\nWhen Nero 180\nHigh over flaming Rome with savage joy\nLowered like a fiend, drank with enraptured ear\nThe shrieks of agonizing death, beheld\nThe frightful desolation spread, and felt\nA new-created sense within his soul\nThrill to the sight and vibrate to the sound,--\nThinkest thou his grandeur had not overcome\nThe force of human kindness? And when Rome\nWith one stern blow hurled not the tyrant down,\nCrushed not the arm red with her dearest blood, 190\nHad not submissive abjectness destroyed\nNature's suggestions?\n\nLook on yonder earth:\nThe golden harvests spring; the unfailing sun\nSheds light and life; the fruits, the flowers, the trees,\nArise in due succession; all things speak\nPeace, harmony and love. The universe,\nIn Nature's silent eloquence, declares\nThat all fulfil the works of love and joy,--\nAll but the outcast, Man. He fabricates\nThe sword which stabs his peace; he cherisheth 200\nThe snakes that gnaw his heart; he raiseth up\nThe tyrant whose delight is in his woe,\nWhose sport is in his agony. Yon sun,\nLights it the great alone? Yon silver beams,\nSleep they less sweetly on the cottage thatch\nThan on the dome of kings? Is mother earth\nA step-dame to her numerous sons who earn\nHer unshared gifts with unremitting toil;\nA mother only to those puling babes\nWho, nursed in ease and luxury, make men 210\nThe playthings of their babyhood and mar\nIn self-important childishness that peace\nWhich men alone appreciate?\n\n'Spirit of Nature, no!\nThe pure diffusion of thy essence throbs\nAlike in every human heart.\nThou aye erectest there\nThy throne of power unappealable;\nThou art the judge beneath whose nod\nMan's brief and frail authority 220\nIs powerless as the wind\nThat passeth idly by;\nThine the tribunal which surpasseth\nThe show of human justice\nAs God surpasses man!\n\n'Spirit of Nature! thou\nLife of interminable multitudes;\nSoul of those mighty spheres\nWhose changeless paths through Heaven's deep silence lie;\nSoul of that smallest being, 230\nThe dwelling of whose life\nIs one faint April sun-gleam;--\nMan, like these passive things,\nThy will unconsciously fulfilleth;\nLike theirs, his age of endless peace,\nWhich time is fast maturing,\nWill swiftly, surely, come;\nAnd the unbounded frame which thou pervadest,\nWill be without a flaw\nMarring its perfect symmetry! 240\n\nIV\n'How beautiful this night! the balmiest sigh,\nWhich vernal zephyrs breathe in evening's ear,\nWere discord to the speaking quietude\nThat wraps this moveless scene. Heaven's ebon vault,\nStudded with stars unutterably bright,\nThrough which the moon's unclouded grandeur rolls,\nSeems like a canopy which love had spread\nTo curtain her sleeping world. Yon gentle hills.\nRobed in a garment of untrodden snow;\nYon darksome rocks, whence icicles depend 10\nSo stainless that their white and glittering spires\nTinge not the moon's pure beam; yon castled steep\nWhose banner hangeth o'er the time-worn tower\nSo idly that rapt fancy deemeth it\nA metaphor of peace;--all form a scene\nWhere musing solitude might love to lift\nHer soul above this sphere of earthliness;\nWhere silence undisturbed might watch alone--\nSo cold, so bright, so still.\n\nThe orb of day\nIn southern climes o'er ocean's waveless field 20\nSinks sweetly smiling; not the faintest breath\nSteals o'er the unruffled deep; the clouds of eve\nReflect unmoved the lingering beam of day;\nAnd Vesper's image on the western main\nIs beautifully still. To-morrow comes:\nCloud upon cloud, in dark and deepening mass,\nRoll o'er the blackened waters; the deep roar\nOf distant thunder mutters awfully;\nTempest unfolds its pinion o'er the gloom\nThat shrouds the boiling surge; the pitiless fiend, 30\nWith all his winds and lightnings, tracks his prey;\nThe torn deep yawns,--the vessel finds a grave\nBeneath its jagged gulf.\n\nAh! whence yon glare\nThat fires the arch of heaven? that dark red smoke\nBlotting the silver moon? The stars are quenched\nIn darkness, and the pure and spangling snow\nGleams faintly through the gloom that gathers round.\nHark to that roar whose swift and deafening peals\nIn countless echoes through the mountains ring,\nStartling pale Midnight on her starry throne! 40\nNow swells the intermingling din; the jar\nFrequent and frightful of the bursting bomb;\nThe falling beam, the shriek, the groan, the shout,\nThe ceaseless clangor, and the rush of men\nInebriate with rage:--loud and more loud\nThe discord grows; till pale Death shuts the scene\nAnd o'er the conqueror and the conquered draws\nHis cold and bloody shroud.--Of all the men\nWhom day's departing beam saw blooming there\nIn proud and vigorous health; of all the hearts 50\nThat beat with anxious life at sunset there;\nHow few survive, how few are beating now!\nAll is deep silence, like the fearful calm\nThat slumbers in the storm's portentous pause;\nSave when the frantic wail of widowed love\nComes shuddering on the blast, or the faint moan\nWith which some soul bursts from the frame of clay\nWrapt round its struggling powers.\n\nThe gray morn\nDawns on the mournful scene; the sulphurous smoke\nBefore the icy wind slow rolls away, 60\nAnd the bright beams of frosty morning dance\nAlong the spangling snow. There tracks of blood\nEven to the forest's depth, and scattered arms,\nAnd lifeless warriors, whose hard lineaments\nDeath's self could change not, mark the dreadful path\nOf the outsallying victors; far behind\nBlack ashes note where their proud city stood.\nWithin yon forest is a gloomy glen--\nEach tree which guards its darkness from the day,\nWaves o'er a warrior's tomb.\n\nI see thee shrink, 70\nSurpassing Spirit!--wert thou human else?\nI see a shade of doubt and horror fleet\nAcross thy stainless features; yet fear not;\nThis is no unconnected misery,\nNor stands uncaused and irretrievable.\nMan's evil nature, that apology\nWhich kings who rule, and cowards who crouch, set up\nFor their unnumbered crimes, sheds not the blood\nWhich desolates the discord-wasted land.\nFrom kings and priests and statesmen war arose, 80\nWhose safety is man's deep unbettered woe,\nWhose grandeur his debasement. Let the axe\nStrike at the root, the poison-tree will fall;\nAnd where its venomed exhalations spread\nRuin, and death, and woe, where millions lay\nQuenching the serpent's famine, and their bones\nBleaching unburied in the putrid blast,\nA garden shall arise, in loveliness\nSurpassing fabled Eden.\n\nHath Nature's soul,--\nThat formed this world so beautiful, that spread 90\nEarth's lap with plenty, and life's smallest chord\nStrung to unchanging unison, that gave\nThe happy birds their dwelling in the grove,\nThat yielded to the wanderers of the deep\nThe lovely silence of the unfathomed main,\nAnd filled the meanest worm that crawls in dust\nWith spirit, thought and love,--on Man alone,\nPartial in causeless malice, wantonly\nHeaped ruin, vice, and slavery; his soul\nBlasted with withering curses; placed afar 100\nThe meteor-happiness, that shuns his grasp,\nBut serving on the frightful gulf to glare\nRent wide beneath his footsteps?\n\nNature!--no!\nKings, priests and statesmen blast the human flower\nEven in its tender bud; their influence darts\nLike subtle poison through the bloodless veins\nOf desolate society. The child,\nEre he can lisp his mother's sacred name,\nSwells with the unnatural pride of crime, and lifts\nHis baby-sword even in a hero's mood. 110\nThis infant arm becomes the bloodiest scourge\nOf devastated earth; whilst specious names,\nLearnt in soft childhood's unsuspecting hour,\nServe as the sophisms with which manhood dims\nBright reason's ray and sanctifies the sword\nUpraised to shed a brother's innocent blood.\nLet priest-led slaves cease to proclaim that man\nInherits vice and misery, when force\nAnd falsehood hang even o'er the cradled babe,\nStifling with rudest grasp all natural good. 120\n\n'Ah! to the stranger-soul, when first it peeps\nFrom its new tenement and looks abroad\nFor happiness and sympathy, how stern\nAnd desolate a tract is this wide world!\nHow withered all the buds of natural good!\nNo shade, no shelter from the sweeping storms\nOf pitiless power! On its wretched frame\nPoisoned, perchance, by the disease and woe\nHeaped on the wretched parent whence it sprung\nBy morals, law and custom, the pure winds 130\nOf heaven, that renovate the insect tribes,\nMay breathe not. The untainting light of day\nMay visit not its longings. It is bound\nEre it has life; yea, all the chains are forged\nLong ere its being; all liberty and love\nAnd peace is torn from its defencelessness;\nCursed from its birth, even from its cradle doomed\nTo abjectness and bondage!\n\n'Throughout this varied and eternal world\nSoul is the only element, the block 140\nThat for uncounted ages has remained.\nThe moveless pillar of a mountain's weight\nIs active living spirit. Every grain\nIs sentient both in unity and part,\nAnd the minutest atom comprehends\nA world of loves and hatreds; these beget\nEvil and good; hence truth and falsehood spring;\nHence will and thought and action, all the germs\nOf pain or pleasure, sympathy or hate,\nThat variegate the eternal universe. 150\nSoul is not more polluted than the beams\nOf heaven's pure orb ere round their rapid lines\nThe taint of earth-born atmospheres arise.\n\n'Man is of soul and body, formed for deeds\nOf high resolve; on fancy's boldest wing\nTo soar unwearied, fearlessly to turn\nThe keenest pangs to peacefulness, and taste\nThe joys which mingled sense and spirit yield;\nOr he is formed for abjectness and woe,\nTo grovel on the dunghill of his fears, 160\nTo shrink at every sound, to quench the flame\nOf natural love in sensualism, to know\nThat hour as blest when on his worthless days\nThe frozen hand of death shall set its seal,\nYet fear the cure, though hating the disease.\nThe one is man that shall hereafter be;\nThe other, man as vice has made him now.\n\n'War is the statesman's game, the priest's delight,\nThe lawyer's jest, the hired assassin's trade,\nAnd to those royal murderers whose mean thrones 170\nAre bought by crimes of treachery and gore,\nThe bread they eat, the staff on which they lean.\nGuards, garbed in blood-red livery, surround\nTheir palaces, participate the crimes\nThat force defends and from a nation's rage\nSecures the crown, which all the curses reach\nThat famine, frenzy, woe and penury breathe.\nThese are the hired bravos who defend\nThe tyrant's throne--the bullies of his fear;\nThese are the sinks and channels of worst vice, 180\nThe refuse of society, the dregs\nOf all that is most vile; their cold hearts blend\nDeceit with sternness, ignorance with pride,\nAll that is mean and villainous with rage\nWhich hopelessness of good and self-contempt\nAlone might kindle; they are decked in wealth,\nHonor and power, then are sent abroad\nTo do their work. The pestilence that stalks\nIn gloomy triumph through some eastern land\nIs less destroying. They cajole with gold 190\nAnd promises of fame the thoughtless youth\nAlready crushed with servitude; he knows\nHis wretchedness too late, and cherishes\nRepentance for his ruin, when his doom\nIs sealed in gold and blood!\nThose too the tyrant serve, who, skilled to snare\nThe feet of justice in the toils of law,\nStand ready to oppress the weaker still,\nAnd right or wrong will vindicate for gold,\nSneering at public virtue, which beneath 200\nTheir pitiless tread lies torn and trampled where\nHonor sits smiling at the sale of truth.\n\n'Then grave and hoary-headed hypocrites,\nWithout a hope, a passion or a love,\nWho through a life of luxury and lies\nHave crept by flattery to the seats of power,\nSupport the system whence their honors flow.\nThey have three words--well tyrants know their use,\nWell pay them for the loan with usury\nTorn from a bleeding world!--God, Hell and Heaven: 210\nA vengeful, pitiless, and almighty fiend,\nWhose mercy is a nickname for the rage\nOf tameless tigers hungering for blood;\nHell, a red gulf of everlasting fire,\nWhere poisonous and undying worms prolong\nEternal misery to those hapless slaves\nWhose life has been a penance for its crimes;\nAnd Heaven, a meed for those who dare belie\nTheir human nature, quake, believe and cringe\nBefore the mockeries of earthly power. 220\n\n'These tools the tyrant tempers to his work,\nWields in his wrath, and as he wills destroys,\nOmnipotent in wickedness; the while\nYouth springs, age moulders, manhood tamely does\nHis bidding, bribed by short-lived joys to lend\nForce to the weakness of his trembling arm.\nThey rise, they fall; one generation comes\nYielding its harvest to destruction's scythe.\nIt fades, another blossoms; yet behold!\nRed glows the tyrant's stamp-mark on its bloom, 230\nWithering and cankering deep its passive prime.\nHe has invented lying words and modes,\nEmpty and vain as his own coreless heart;\nEvasive meanings, nothings of much sound,\nTo lure the heedless victim to the toils\nSpread round the valley of its paradise.\n\n'Look to thyself, priest, conqueror or prince!\nWhether thy trade is falsehood, and thy lusts\nDeep wallow in the earnings of the poor,\nWith whom thy master was; or thou delight'st 240\nIn numbering o'er the myriads of thy slain,\nAll misery weighing nothing in the scale\nAgainst thy short-lived fame; or thou dost load\nWith cowardice and crime the groaning land,\nA pomp-fed king. Look to thy wretched self!\nAy, art thou not the veriest slave that e'er\nCrawled on the loathing earth? Are not thy days\nDays of unsatisfying listlessness?\nDost thou not cry, ere night's long rack is o'er,\n\"When will the morning come?\" Is not thy youth 250\nA vain and feverish dream of sensualism?\nThy manhood blighted with unripe disease?\nAre not thy views of unregretted death\nDrear, comfortless and horrible? Thy mind,\nIs it not morbid as thy nerveless frame,\nIncapable of judgment, hope or love?\nAnd dost thou wish the errors to survive,\nThat bar thee from all sympathies of good,\nAfter the miserable interest\nThou hold'st in their protraction? When the grave 260\nHas swallowed up thy memory and thyself,\nDost thou desire the bane that poisons earth\nTo twine its roots around thy coffined clay,\nSpring from thy bones, and blossom on thy tomb,\nThat of its fruit thy babes may eat and die?\n\nV\n'Thus do the generations of the earth\nGo to the grave and issue from the womb,\nSurviving still the imperishable change\nThat renovates the world; even as the leaves\nWhich the keen frost-wind of the waning year\nHas scattered on the forest-soil and heaped\nFor many seasons there--though long they choke,\nLoading with loathsome rottenness the land,\nAll germs of promise, yet when the tall trees\nFrom which they fell, shorn of their lovely shapes, 10\nLie level with the earth to moulder there,\nThey fertilize the land they long deformed;\nTill from the breathing lawn a forest springs\nOf youth, integrity and loveliness,\nLike that which gave it life, to spring and die.\nThus suicidal selfishness, that blights\nThe fairest feelings of the opening heart,\nIs destined to decay, whilst from the soil\nShall spring all virtue, all delight, all love,\nAnd judgment cease to wage unnatural war 20\nWith passion's unsubduable array.\nTwin-sister of Religion, Selfishness!\nRival in crime and falsehood, aping all\nThe wanton horrors of her bloody play;\nYet frozen, unimpassioned, spiritless,\nShunning the light, and owning not its name,\nCompelled by its deformity to screen\nWith flimsy veil of justice and of right\nIts unattractive lineaments that scare\nAll save the brood of ignorance; at once 30\nThe cause and the effect of tyranny;\nUnblushing, hardened, sensual and vile;\nDead to all love but of its abjectness;\nWith heart impassive by more noble powers\nThan unshared pleasure, sordid gain, or fame;\nDespising its own miserable being,\nWhich still it longs, yet fears, to disenthrall.\n\n'Hence commerce springs, the venal interchange\nOf all that human art or Nature yield;\nWhich wealth should purchase not, but want demand, 40\nAnd natural kindness hasten to supply\nFrom the full fountain of its boundless love,\nForever stifled, drained and tainted now.\nCommerce! beneath whose poison-breathing shade\nNo solitary virtue dares to spring,\nBut poverty and wealth with equal hand\nScatter their withering curses, and unfold\nThe doors of premature and violent death\nTo pining famine and full-fed disease,\nTo all that shares the lot of human life, 50\nWhich, poisoned body and soul, scarce drags the chain\nThat lengthens as it goes and clanks behind.\n\n'Commerce has set the mark of selfishness,\nThe signet of its all-enslaving power,\nUpon a shining ore, and called it gold;\nBefore whose image bow the vulgar great,\nThe vainly rich, the miserable proud,\nThe mob of peasants, nobles, priests and kings,\nAnd with blind feelings reverence the power\nThat grinds them to the dust of misery. 60\nBut in the temple of their hireling hearts\nGold is a living god and rules in scorn\nAll earthly things but virtue.\n\n'Since tyrants by the sale of human life\nHeap luxuries to their sensualism, and fame\nTo their wide-wasting and insatiate pride,\nSuccess has sanctioned to a credulous world\nThe ruin, the disgrace, the woe of war.\nHis hosts of blind and unresisting dupes\nThe despot numbers; from his cabinet 70\nThese puppets of his schemes he moves at will,\nEven as the slaves by force or famine driven,\nBeneath a vulgar master, to perform\nA task of cold and brutal drudgery;--\nHardened to hope, insensible to fear,\nScarce living pulleys of a dead machine,\nMere wheels of work and articles of trade,\nThat grace the proud and noisy pomp of wealth!\n\n'The harmony and happiness of man\nYields to the wealth of nations; that which lifts 80\nHis nature to the heaven of its pride,\nIs bartered for the poison of his soul;\nThe weight that drags to earth his towering hopes,\nBlighting all prospect but of selfish gain,\nWithering all passion but of slavish fear,\nExtinguishing all free and generous love\nOf enterprise and daring, even the pulse\nThat fancy kindles in the beating heart\nTo mingle with sensation, it destroys,--\nLeaves nothing but the sordid lust of self, 90\nThe grovelling hope of interest and gold,\nUnqualified, unmingled, unredeemed\nEven by hypocrisy.\n\nAnd statesmen boast\nOf wealth! The wordy eloquence that lives\nAfter the ruin of their hearts, can gild\nThe bitter poison of a nation's woe;\nCan turn the worship of the servile mob\nTo their corrupt and glaring idol, fame,\nFrom virtue, trampled by its iron tread,--\nAlthough its dazzling pedestal be raised 100\nAmid the horrors of a limb-strewn field,\nWith desolated dwellings smoking round.\nThe man of ease, who, by his warm fireside,\nTo deeds of charitable intercourse\nAnd bare fulfilment of the common laws\nOf decency and prejudice confines\nThe struggling nature of his human heart,\nIs duped by their cold sophistry; he sheds\nA passing tear perchance upon the wreck\nOf earthly peace, when near his dwelling's door 110\nThe frightful waves are driven,--when his son\nIs murdered by the tyrant, or religion\nDrives his wife raving mad. But the poor man\nWhose life is misery, and fear and care;\nWhom the morn wakens but to fruitless toil;\nWho ever hears his famished offspring's scream;\nWhom their pale mother's uncomplaining gaze\nForever meets, and the proud rich man's eye\nFlashing command, and the heart-breaking scene\nOf thousands like himself;--he little heeds 120\nThe rhetoric of tyranny; his hate\nIs quenchless as his wrongs; he laughs to scorn\nThe vain and bitter mockery of words,\nFeeling the horror of the tyrant's deeds,\nAnd unrestrained but by the arm of power,\nThat knows and dreads his enmity.\n\n'The iron rod of penury still compels\nHer wretched slave to bow the knee to wealth,\nAnd poison, with unprofitable toil,\nA life too void of solace to confirm 130\nThe very chains that bind him to his doom.\nNature, impartial in munificence,\nHas gifted man with all-subduing will.\nMatter, with all its transitory shapes,\nLies subjected and plastic at his feet,\nThat, weak from bondage, tremble as they tread.\nHow many a rustic Milton has passed by,\nStifling the speechless longings of his heart,\nIn unremitting drudgery and care!\nHow many a vulgar Cato has compelled 140\nHis energies, no longer tameless then,\nTo mould a pin or fabricate a nail!\nHow many a Newton, to whose passive ken\nThose mighty spheres that gem infinity\nWere only specks of tinsel fixed in heaven\nTo light the midnights of his native town!\n\n'Yet every heart contains perfection's germ.\nThe wisest of the sages of the earth,\nThat ever from the stores of reason drew\nScience and truth, and virtue's dreadless tone, 150\nWere but a weak and inexperienced boy,\nProud, sensual, unimpassioned, unimbued\nWith pure desire and universal love,\nCompared to that high being, of cloudless brain,\nUntainted passion, elevated will,\nWhich death (who even would linger long in awe\nWithin his noble presence and beneath\nHis changeless eye-beam) might alone subdue.\nHim, every slave now dragging through the filth\nOf some corrupted city his sad life, 160\nPining with famine, swoln with luxury,\nBlunting the keenness of his spiritual sense\nWith narrow schemings and unworthy cares,\nOr madly rushing through all violent crime\nTo move the deep stagnation of his soul,--\nMight imitate and equal.\n\nBut mean lust\nHas bound its chains so tight about the earth\nThat all within it but the virtuous man\nIs venal; gold or fame will surely reach\nThe price prefixed by Selfishness to all 170\nBut him of resolute and unchanging will;\nWhom nor the plaudits of a servile crowd,\nNor the vile joys of tainting luxury,\nCan bribe to yield his elevated soul\nTo Tyranny or Falsehood, though they wield\nWith blood-red hand the sceptre of the world.\n\n'All things are sold: the very light of heaven\nIs venal; earth's unsparing gifts of love,\nThe smallest and most despicable things\nThat lurk in the abysses of the deep, 180\nAll objects of our life, even life itself,\nAnd the poor pittance which the laws allow\nOf liberty, the fellowship of man,\nThose duties which his heart of human love\nShould urge him to perform instinctively,\nAre bought and sold as in a public mart\nOf undisguising Selfishness, that sets\nOn each its price, the stamp-mark of her reign.\nEven love is sold; the solace of all woe\nIs turned to deadliest agony, old age 190\nShivers in selfish beauty's loathing arms,\nAnd youth's corrupted impulses prepare\nA life of horror from the blighting bane\nOf commerce; whilst the pestilence that springs\nFrom unenjoying sensualism, has filled\nAll human life with hydra-headed woes.\n\n'Falsehood demands but gold to pay the pangs\nOf outraged conscience; for the slavish priest\nSets no great value on his hireling faith;\nA little passing pomp, some servile souls, 200\nWhom cowardice itself might safely chain\nOr the spare mite of avarice could bribe\nTo deck the triumph of their languid zeal,\nCan make him minister to tyranny.\nMore daring crime requires a loftier meed.\nWithout a shudder the slave-soldier lends\nHis arm to murderous deeds, and steels his heart,\nWhen the dread eloquence of dying men,\nLow mingling on the lonely field of fame,\nAssails that nature whose applause he sells 210\nFor the gross blessings of the patriot mob,\nFor the vile gratitude of heartless kings,\nAnd for a cold world's good word,--viler still!\n\n'There is a nobler glory which survives\nUntil our being fades, and, solacing\nAll human care, accompanies its change;\nDeserts not virtue in the dungeon's gloom,\nAnd in the precincts of the palace guides\nIts footsteps through that labyrinth of crime;\nImbues his lineaments with dauntlessness, 220\nEven when from power's avenging hand he takes\nIts sweetest, last and noblest title--death;\n--The consciousness of good, which neither gold,\nNor sordid fame, nor hope of heavenly bliss,\nCan purchase; but a life of resolute good,\nUnalterable will, quenchless desire\nOf universal happiness, the heart\nThat beats with it in unison, the brain\nWhose ever-wakeful wisdom toils to change\nReason's rich stores for its eternal weal. 230\n\n'This commerce of sincerest virtue needs\nNo meditative signs of selfishness,\nNo jealous intercourse of wretched gain,\nNo balancings of prudence, cold and long;\nIn just and equal measure all is weighed,\nOne scale contains the sum of human weal,\nAnd one, the good man's heart.\n\nHow vainly seek\nThe selfish for that happiness denied\nTo aught but virtue! Blind and hardened, they,\nWho hope for peace amid the storms of care, 240\nWho covet power they know not how to use,\nAnd sigh for pleasure they refuse to give,--\nMadly they frustrate still their own designs;\nAnd, where they hope that quiet to enjoy\nWhich virtue pictures, bitterness of soul,\nPining regrets, and vain repentances,\nDisease, disgust and lassitude pervade\nTheir valueless and miserable lives.\n\n'But hoary-headed selfishness has felt\nIts death-blow and is tottering to the grave; 250\nA brighter morn awaits the human day,\nWhen every transfer of earth's natural gifts\nShall be a commerce of good words and works;\nWhen poverty and wealth, the thirst of fame,\nThe fear of infamy, disease and woe,\nWar with its million horrors, and fierce hell,\nShall live but in the memory of time,\nWho, like a penitent libertine, shall start,\nLook back, and shudder at his younger years.'\n\nVI\nAll touch, all eye, all ear,\nThe Spirit felt the Fairy's burning speech.\nO'er the thin texture of its frame\nThe varying periods painted changing glows,\nAs on a summer even,\nWhen soul-enfolding music floats around,\nThe stainless mirror of the lake\nRe-images the eastern gloom,\nMingling convulsively its purple hues\nWith sunset's burnished gold. 10\nThen thus the Spirit spoke:\n'It is a wild and miserable world!\nThorny, and full of care,\nWhich every fiend can make his prey at will!\nO Fairy! in the lapse of years,\nIs there no hope in store?\nWill yon vast suns roll on\nInterminably, still illuming\nThe night of so many wretched souls,\nAnd see no hope for them? 20\nWill not the universal Spirit e'er\nRevivify this withered limb of Heaven?'\n\nThe Fairy calmly smiled\nIn comfort, and a kindling gleam of hope\nSuffused the Spirit's lineaments.\n'Oh! rest thee tranquil; chase those fearful doubts\nWhich ne'er could rack an everlasting soul\nThat sees the chains which bind it to its doom.\nYes! crime and misery are in yonder earth,\nFalsehood, mistake and lust; 30\nBut the eternal world\nContains at once the evil and the cure.\nSome eminent in virtue shall start up,\nEven in perversest time;\nThe truths of their pure lips, that never die,\nShall bind the scorpion falsehood with a wreath\nOf ever-living flame,\nUntil the monster sting itself to death.\n\n'How sweet a scene will earth become!\nOf purest spirits a pure dwelling-place, 40\nSymphonious with the planetary spheres;\nWhen man, with changeless Nature coalescing,\nWill undertake regeneration's work,\nWhen its ungenial poles no longer point\nTo the red and baleful sun\nThat faintly twinkles there!\n\n'Spirit, on yonder earth,\nFalsehood now triumphs; deadly power\nHas fixed its seal upon the lip of truth!\nMadness and misery are there! 50\nThe happiest is most wretched!

Then thou becamest, a boy,\nMore daring in thy frenzies; every shape, 80\nMonstrous or vast, or beautifully wild,\nWhich from sensation's relics fancy culls;\nThe spirits of the air, the shuddering ghost,\nThe genii of the elements, the powers\nThat give a shape to Nature's varied works,\nHad life and place in the corrupt belief\nOf thy blind heart; yet still thy youthful hands\nWere pure of human blood. Then manhood gave\nIts strength and ardor to thy frenzied brain;\nThine eager gaze scanned the stupendous scene, 90\nWhose wonders mocked the knowledge of thy pride;\nTheir everlasting and unchanging laws\nReproached thine ignorance. Awhile thou stood'st\nBaffled and gloomy; then thou didst sum up\nThe elements of all that thou didst know;\nThe changing seasons, winter's leafless reign,\nThe budding of the heaven-breathing trees,\nThe eternal orbs that beautify the night,\nThe sunrise, and the setting of the moon,\nEarthquakes and wars, and poisons and disease, 100\nAnd all their causes, to an abstract point\nConverging thou didst bend, and called it God!\nThe self-sufficing, the omnipotent,\nThe merciful, and the avenging God!\nWho, prototype of human misrule, sits\nHigh in heaven's realm, upon a golden throne,\nEven like an earthly king; and whose dread work,\nHell, gapes forever for the unhappy slaves\nOf fate, whom he created in his sport\nTo triumph in their torments when they fell! 110\nEarth heard the name; earth trembled as the smoke\nOf his revenge ascended up to heaven,\nBlotting the constellations; and the cries\nOf millions butchered in sweet confidence\nAnd unsuspecting peace, even when the bonds\nOf safety were confirmed by wordy oaths\nSworn in his dreadful name, rung through the land;\nWhilst innocent babes writhed on thy stubborn spear,\nAnd thou didst laugh to hear the mother's shriek\nOf maniac gladness, as the sacred steel 120\nFelt cold in her torn entrails!\n\n'Religion! thou wert then in manhood's prime;\nBut age crept on; one God would not suffice\nFor senile puerility; thou framedst\nA tale to suit thy dotage and to glut\nThy misery-thirsting soul, that the mad fiend\nThy wickedness had pictured might afford\nA plea for sating the unnatural thirst\nFor murder, rapine, violence and crime,\nThat still consumed thy being, even when 130\nThou heard'st the step of fate; that flames might light\nThy funeral scene; and the shrill horrent shrieks\nOf parents dying on the pile that burned\nTo light their children to thy paths, the roar\nOf the encircling flames, the exulting cries\nOf thine apostles loud commingling there,\nMight sate thine hungry ear\nEven on the bed of death!\n\n'But now contempt is mocking thy gray hairs;\nThou art descending to the darksome grave, 140\nUnhonored and unpitied but by those\nWhose pride is passing by like thine, and sheds,\nLike thine, a glare that fades before the sun\nOf truth, and shines but in the dreadful night\nThat long has lowered above the ruined world.\n\n'Throughout these infinite orbs of mingling light\nOf which yon earth is one, is wide diffused\nA Spirit of activity and life,\nThat knows no term, cessation or decay;\nThat fades not when the lamp of earthly life, 150\nExtinguished in the dampness of the grave,\nAwhile there slumbers, more than when the babe\nIn the dim newness of its being feels\nThe impulses of sublunary things,\nAnd all is wonder to unpractised sense;\nBut, active, steadfast and eternal, still\nGuides the fierce whirlwind, in the tempest roars,\nCheers in the day, breathes in the balmy groves,\nStrengthens in health, and poisons in disease;\nAnd in the storm of change, that ceaselessly 160\nRolls round the eternal universe and shakes\nIts undecaying battlement, presides,\nApportioning with irresistible law\nThe place each spring of its machine shall fill;\nSo that, when waves on waves tumultuous heap\nConfusion to the clouds, and fiercely driven\nHeaven's lightnings scorch the uprooted ocean-fords--\nWhilst, to the eye of shipwrecked mariner,\nLone sitting on the bare and shuddering rock,\nAll seems unlinked contingency and chance-- 170\nNo atom of this turbulence fulfils\nA vague and unnecessitated task\nOr acts but as it must and ought to act.\nEven the minutest molecule of light,\nThat in an April sunbeam's fleeting glow\nFulfils its destined though invisible work,\nThe universal Spirit guides; nor less\nWhen merciless ambition, or mad zeal,\nHas led two hosts of dupes to battle-field,\nThat, blind, they there may dig each other's graves 180\nAnd call the sad work glory, does it rule\nAll passions; not a thought, a will, an act,\nNo working of the tyrant's moody mind,\nNor one misgiving of the slaves who boast\nTheir servitude to hide the shame they feel,\nNor the events enchaining every will,\nThat from the depths of unrecorded time\nHave drawn all-influencing virtue, pass\nUnrecognized or unforeseen by thee,\nSoul of the Universe! eternal spring 190\nOf life and death, of happiness and woe,\nOf all that chequers the phantasmal scene\nThat floats before our eyes in wavering light,\nWhich gleams but on the darkness of our prison\nWhose chains and massy walls\nWe feel but cannot see.\n\n'Spirit of Nature! all-sufficing Power,\nNecessity! thou mother of the world!\nUnlike the God of human error, thou\nRequirest no prayers or praises; the caprice 200\nOf man's weak will belongs no more to thee\nThan do the changeful passions of his breast\nTo thy unvarying harmony; the slave,\nWhose horrible lusts spread misery o'er the world,\nAnd the good man, who lifts with virtuous pride\nHis being in the sight of happiness\nThat springs from his own works; the poison-tree,\nBeneath whose shade all life is withered up,\nAnd the fair oak, whose leafy dome affords\nA temple where the vows of happy love 210\nAre registered, are equal in thy sight;\nNo love, no hate thou cherishest; revenge\nAnd favoritism, and worst desire of fame\nThou knowest not; all that the wide world contains\nAre but thy passive instruments, and thou\nRegard'st them all with an impartial eye,\nWhose joy or pain thy nature cannot feel,\nBecause thou hast not human sense,\nBecause thou art not human mind.\n\n'Yes! when the sweeping storm of time 220\nHas sung its death-dirge o'er the ruined fanes\nAnd broken altars of the almighty fiend,\nWhose name usurps thy honors, and the blood\nThrough centuries clotted there has floated down\nThe tainted flood of ages, shalt thou live\nUnchangeable! A shrine is raised to thee,\nWhich nor the tempest breath of time,\nNor the interminable flood\nOver earth's slight pageant rolling,\nAvaileth to destroy,-- 230\nThe sensitive extension of the world;\nThat wondrous and eternal fane,\nWhere pain and pleasure, good and evil join,\nTo do the will of strong necessity,\nAnd life, in multitudinous shapes,\nStill pressing forward where no term can be,\nLike hungry and unresting flame\nCurls round the eternal columns of its strength.'\n\nVII\nSPIRIT\n'I was an infant when my mother went\nTo see an atheist burned. She took me there.\nThe dark-robed priests were met around the pile;\nThe multitude was gazing silently;\nAnd as the culprit passed with dauntless mien,\nTempered disdain in his unaltering eye,\nMixed with a quiet smile, shone calmly forth;\nThe thirsty fire crept round his manly limbs;\nHis resolute eyes were scorched to blindness soon;\nHis death-pang rent my heart! the insensate mob 10\nUttered a cry of triumph, and I wept.\n\"Weep not, child!\" cried my mother, \"for that man\nHas said, There is no God.\"'\n\nFAIRY\n'There is no God!\nNature confirms the faith his death-groan sealed.\nLet heaven and earth, let man's revolving race,\nHis ceaseless generations, tell their tale;\nLet every part depending on the chain\nThat links it to the whole, point to the hand\nThat grasps its term! Let every seed that falls\nIn silent eloquence unfold its store 20\nOf argument; infinity within,\nInfinity without, belie creation;\nThe exterminable spirit it contains\nIs Nature's only God; but human pride\nIs skilful to invent most serious names\nTo hide its ignorance.\n'The name of God\nHas fenced about all crime with holiness,\nHimself the creature of his worshippers,\nWhose names and attributes and passions change,\nSeeva, Buddh, Foh, Jehovah, God, or Lord, 30\nEven with the human dupes who build his shrines,\nStill serving o'er the war-polluted world\nFor desolation's watchword; whether hosts\nStain his death-blushing chariot-wheels, as on\nTriumphantly they roll, whilst Brahmins raise\nA sacred hymn to mingle with the groans;\nOr countless partners of his power divide\nHis tyranny to weakness; or the smoke\nOf burning towns, the cries of female helplessness,\nUnarmed old age, and youth, and infancy, 40\nHorribly massacred, ascend to heaven\nIn honor of his name; or, last and worst,\nEarth groans beneath religion's iron age,\nAnd priests dare babble of a God of peace,\nEven whilst their hands are red with guiltless blood,\nMurdering the while, uprooting every germ\nOf truth, exterminating, spoiling all,\nMaking the earth a slaughter-house!\n\n'O Spirit! through the sense\nBy which thy inner nature was apprised 50\nOf outward shows, vague dreams have rolled,\nAnd varied reminiscences have waked\nTablets that never fade;\nAll things have been imprinted there,\nThe stars, the sea, the earth, the sky,\nEven the unshapeliest lineaments\nOf wild and fleeting visions\nHave left a record there\nTo testify of earth.\n\n'These are my empire, for to me is given 60\nThe wonders of the human world to keep,\nAnd fancy's thin creations to endow\nWith manner, being and reality;\nTherefore a wondrous phantom from the dreams\nOf human error's dense and purblind faith\nI will evoke, to meet thy questioning.\nAhasuerus, rise!'\n\nA strange and woe-worn wight\nArose beside the battlement,\nAnd stood unmoving there. 70\nHis inessential figure cast no shade\nUpon the golden floor;\nHis port and mien bore mark of many years,\nAnd chronicles of untold ancientness\nWere legible within his beamless eye;\nYet his cheek bore the mark of youth;\nFreshness and vigor knit his manly frame;\nThe wisdom of old age was mingled there\nWith youth's primeval dauntlessness;\nAnd inexpressible woe, 80\nChastened by fearless resignation, gave\nAn awful grace to his all-speaking brow.\n\nSPIRIT\n'Is there a God?'\n\nAHASUERUS\n'Is there a God!--ay, an almighty God,\nAnd vengeful as almighty! Once his voice\nWas heard on earth; earth shuddered at the sound;\nThe fiery-visaged firmament expressed\nAbhorrence, and the grave of Nature yawned\nTo swallow all the dauntless and the good\nThat dared to hurl defiance at his throne, 90\nGirt as it was with power. None but slaves\nSurvived,--cold-blooded slaves, who did the work\nOf tyrannous omnipotence; whose souls\nNo honest indignation ever urged\nTo elevated daring, to one deed\nWhich gross and sensual self did not pollute.\nThese slaves built temples for the omnipotent fiend,\nGorgeous and vast; the costly altars smoked\nWith human blood, and hideous p\u00e6ans rung\nThrough all the long-drawn aisles. A murderer heard 100\nHis voice in Egypt, one whose gifts and arts\nHad raised him to his eminence in power,\nAccomplice of omnipotence in crime\nAnd confidant of the all-knowing one.\nThese were Jehovah's words.\n\n'\"From an eternity of idleness\nI, God, awoke; in seven days' toil made earth\nFrom nothing; rested, and created man;\nI placed him in a paradise, and there\nPlanted the tree of evil, so that he 110\nMight eat and perish, and my soul procure\nWherewith to sate its malice and to turn,\nEven like a heartless conqueror of the earth,\nAll misery to my fame. The race of men,\nChosen to my honor, with impunity\nMay sate the lusts I planted in their heart.\nHere I command thee hence to lead them on,\nUntil with hardened feet their conquering troops\nWade on the promised soil through woman's blood,\nAnd make my name be dreaded through the land. 120\nYet ever-burning flame and ceaseless woe\nShall be the doom of their eternal souls,\nWith every soul on this ungrateful earth,\nVirtuous or vicious, weak or strong,--even all\nShall perish, to fulfil the blind revenge\n(Which you, to men, call justice) of their God.\"\n\n'The murderer's brow\nQuivered with horror.\n\n'\"God omnipotent,\nIs there no mercy? must our punishment\nBe endless? will long ages roll away, 130\nAnd see no term? Oh! wherefore hast thou made\nIn mockery and wrath this evil earth?\nMercy becomes the powerful--be but just!\nO God! repent and save!\"\n\n'\"One way remains:\nI will beget a son and he shall bear\nThe sins of all the world; he shall arise\nIn an unnoticed corner of the earth,\nAnd there shall die upon a cross, and purge\nThe universal crime; so that the few\nOn whom my grace descends, those who are marked 140\nAs vessels to the honor of their God,\nMay credit this strange sacrifice and save\nTheir souls alive. Millions shall live and die,\nWho ne'er shall call upon their Saviour's name,\nBut, unredeemed, go to the gaping grave,\nThousands shall deem it an old woman's tale,\nSuch as the nurses frighten babes withal;\nThese in a gulf of anguish and of flame\nShall curse their reprobation endlessly,\nYet tenfold pangs shall force them to avow, 150\nEven on their beds of torment where they howl,\nMy honor and the justice of their doom.\nWhat then avail their virtuous deeds, their thoughts\nOf purity, with radiant genius bright\nOr lit with human reason's earthly ray?\nMany are called, but few will I elect.\nDo thou my bidding, Moses!\"\n\n'Even the murderer's cheek\nWas blanched with horror, and his quivering lips\nScarce faintly uttered--\"O almighty one,\nI tremble and obey!\" 160\n\n'O Spirit! centuries have set their seal\nOn this heart of many wounds, and loaded brain,\nSince the Incarnate came; humbly he came,\nVeiling his horrible Godhead in the shape\nOf man, scorned by the world, his name unheard\nSave by the rabble of his native town,\nEven as a parish demagogue. He led\nThe crowd; he taught them justice, truth and peace,\nIn semblance; but he lit within their souls\nThe quenchless flames of zeal, and blessed the sword 170\nHe brought on earth to satiate with the blood\nOf truth and freedom his malignant soul\nAt length his mortal frame was led to death.\nI stood beside him; on the torturing cross\nNo pain assailed his unterrestrial sense;\nAnd yet he groaned. Indignantly I summed\nThe massacres and miseries which his name\nHad sanctioned in my country, and I cried,\n\"Go! go!\" in mockery.\nA smile of godlike malice reillumined 180\nHis fading lineaments. \"I go,\" he cried,\n\"But thou shalt wander o'er the unquiet earth\nEternally.\" The dampness of the grave\nBathed my imperishable front. I fell,\nAnd long lay tranced upon the charm\u00e8d soil.\nWhen I awoke hell burned within my brain\nWhich staggered on its seat; for all around\nThe mouldering relics of my kindred lay,\nEven as the Almighty's ire arrested them,\nAnd in their various attitudes of death 190\nMy murdered children's mute and eyeless skulls\nGlared ghastily upon me.\n\nBut my soul,\nFrom sight and sense of the polluting woe\nOf tyranny, had long learned to prefer\nHell's freedom to the servitude of heaven.\nTherefore I rose, and dauntlessly began\nMy lonely and unending pilgrimage,\nResolved to wage unweariable war\nWith my almighty tyrant and to hurl\nDefiance at his impotence to harm 200\nBeyond the curse I bore. The very hand,\nThat barred my passage to the peaceful grave,\nHas crushed the earth to misery, and given\nIts empire to the chosen of his slaves.\nThese I have seen, even from the earliest dawn\nOf weak, unstable and precarious power,\nThen preaching peace, as now they practise war;\nSo, when they turned but from the massacre\nOf unoffending infidels to quench\nTheir thirst for ruin in the very blood 210\nThat flowed in their own veins, and pitiless zeal\nFroze every human feeling as the wife\nSheathed in her husband's heart the sacred steel,\nEven whilst its hopes were dreaming of her love;\nAnd friends to friends, brothers to brothers stood\nOpposed in bloodiest battle-field, and war,\nScarce satiable by fate's last death-draught, waged,\nDrunk from the wine-press of the Almighty's wrath;\nWhilst the red cross, in mockery of peace,\nPointed to victory! When the fray was done, 220\nNo remnant of the exterminated faith\nSurvived to tell its ruin, but the flesh,\nWith putrid smoke poisoning the atmosphere,\nThat rotted on the half-extinguished pile.\n\n'Yes! I have seen God's worshippers unsheathe\nThe sword of his revenge, when grace descended,\nConfirming all unnatural impulses,\nTo sanctify their desolating deeds;\nAnd frantic priests waved the ill-omened cross\nO'er the unhappy earth; then shone the sun 230\nOn showers of gore from the upflashing steel\nOf safe assassination, and all crime\nMade stingless by the spirits of the Lord,\nAnd blood-red rainbows canopied the land.\n\n'Spirit! no year of my eventful being\nHas passed unstained by crime and misery,\nWhich flows from God's own faith. I 've marked his slaves\nWith tongues, whose lies are venomous, beguile\nThe insensate mob, and, whilst one hand was red\nWith murder, feign to stretch the other out 240\nFor brotherhood and peace; and that they now\nBabble of love and mercy, whilst their deeds\nAre marked with all the narrowness and crime\nThat freedom's young arm dare not yet chastise,\nReason may claim our gratitude, who now,\nEstablishing the imperishable throne\nOf truth and stubborn virtue, maketh vain\nThe unprevailing malice of my foe,\nWhose bootless rage heaps torments for the brave,\nAdds impotent eternities to pain, 250\nWhilst keenest disappointment racks his breast\nTo see the smiles of peace around them play,\nTo frustrate or to sanctify their doom.\n\n'Thus have I stood,--through a wild waste of years\nStruggling with whirlwinds of mad agony,\nYet peaceful, and serene, and self-enshrined,\nMocking my powerless tyrant's horrible curse\nWith stubborn and unalterable will,\nEven as a giant oak, which heaven's fierce flame\nHad scath\u00e8d in the wilderness, to stand 260\nA monument of fadeless ruin there;\nYet peacefully and movelessly it braves\nThe midnight conflict of the wintry storm,\nAs in the sunlight's calm it spreads\nIts worn and withered arms on high\nTo meet the quiet of a summer's noon.'\n\nThe Fairy waved her wand;\nAhasuerus fled\nFast as the shapes of mingled shade and mist,\nThat lurk in the glens of a twilight grove, 270\nFlee from the morning beam;--\nThe matter of which dreams are made\nNot more endowed with actual life\nThan this phantasmal portraiture\nOf wandering human thought.\n\nVIII\nTHE FAIRY\n'The present and the past thou hast beheld.\nIt was a desolate sight. Now, Spirit, learn,\nThe secrets of the future.--Time!\nUnfold the brooding pinion of thy gloom,\nRender thou up thy half-devoured babes,\nAnd from the cradles of eternity,\nWhere millions lie lulled to their portioned sleep\nBy the deep murmuring stream of passing things,\nTear thou that gloomy shroud.--Spirit, behold\nThy glorious destiny!' 10\n\nJoy to the Spirit came.\nThrough the wide rent in Time's eternal veil,\nHope was seen beaming through the mists of fear;\nEarth was no longer hell;\nLove, freedom, health had given\nTheir ripeness to the manhood of its prime,\nAnd all its pulses beat\nSymphonious to the planetary spheres;\nThen dulcet music swelled\nConcordant with the life-strings of the soul; 20\nIt throbbed in sweet and languid beatings there,\nCatching new life from transitory death;\nLike the vague sighings of a wind at even\nThat wakes the wavelets of the slumbering sea\nAnd dies on the creation of its breath,\nAnd sinks and rises, falls and swells by fits,\nWas the pure stream of feeling\nThat sprung from these sweet notes,\nAnd o'er the Spirit's human sympathies\nWith mild and gentle motion calmly flowed. 30\n\nJoy to the Spirit came,--\nSuch joy as when a lover sees\nThe chosen of his soul in happiness\nAnd witnesses her peace\nWhose woe to him were bitterer than death;\nSees her unfaded cheek\nGlow mantling in first luxury of health,\nThrills with her lovely eyes,\nWhich like two stars amid the heaving main\nSparkle through liquid bliss. 40\n\nThen in her triumph spoke the Fairy Queen:\n'I will not call the ghost of ages gone\nTo unfold the frightful secrets of its lore;\nThe present now is past,\nAnd those events that desolate the earth\nHave faded from the memory of Time,\nWho dares not give reality to that\nWhose being I annul. To me is given\nThe wonders of the human world to keep,\nSpace, matter, time and mind. Futurity 50\nExposes now its treasure; let the sight\nRenew and strengthen all thy failing hope.\nO human Spirit! spur thee to the goal\nWhere virtue fixes universal peace,\nAnd, 'midst the ebb and flow of human things,\nShow somewhat stable, somewhat certain still,\nA light-house o'er the wild of dreary waves.\n\n'The habitable earth is full of bliss;\nThose wastes of frozen billows that were hurled\nBy everlasting snow-storms round the poles, 60\nWhere matter dared not vegetate or live,\nBut ceaseless frost round the vast solitude\nBound its broad zone of stillness, are unloosed;\nAnd fragrant zephyrs there from spicy isles\nRuffle the placid ocean-deep, that rolls\nIts broad, bright surges to the sloping sand,\nWhose roar is wakened into echoings sweet\nTo murmur through the heaven-breathing groves\nAnd melodize with man's blest nature there.\n\n'Those deserts of immeasurable sand, 70\nWhose age-collected fervors scarce allowed\nA bird to live, a blade of grass to spring,\nWhere the shrill chirp of the green lizard's love\nBroke on the sultry silentness alone,\nNow teem with countless rills and shady woods,\nCornfields and pastures and white cottages;\nAnd where the startled wilderness beheld\nA savage conqueror stained in kindred blood,\nA tigress sating with the flesh of lambs\nThe unnatural famine of her toothless cubs, 80\nWhilst shouts and howlings through the desert rang,--\nSloping and smooth the daisy-spangled lawn,\nOffering sweet incense to the sunrise, smiles\nTo see a babe before his mother's door,\nSharing his morning's meal\nWith the green and golden basilisk\nThat comes to lick his feet.\n\n'Those trackless deeps, where many a weary sail\nHas seen above the illimitable plain\nMorning on night and night on morning rise, 90\nWhilst still no land to greet the wanderer spread\nIts shadowy mountains on the sun-bright sea,\nWhere the loud roarings of the tempest-waves\nSo long have mingled with the gusty wind\nIn melancholy loneliness, and swept\nThe desert of those ocean solitudes\nBut vocal to the sea-bird's harrowing shriek,\nThe bellowing monster, and the rushing storm;\nNow to the sweet and many-mingling sounds\nOf kindliest human impulses respond. 100\nThose lonely realms bright garden-isles begem,\nWith lightsome clouds and shining seas between,\nAnd fertile valleys, resonant with bliss,\nWhilst green woods overcanopy the wave,\nWhich like a toil-worn laborer leaps to shore\nTo meet the kisses of the flowrets there.\n\n'All things are recreated, and the flame\nOf consentaneous love inspires all life.\nThe fertile bosom of the earth gives suck\nTo myriads, who still grow beneath her care, 110\nRewarding her with their pure perfectness;\nThe balmy breathings of the wind inhale\nHer virtues and diffuse them all abroad;\nHealth floats amid the gentle atmosphere,\nGlows in the fruits and mantles on the stream;\nNo storms deform the beaming brow of heaven,\nNor scatter in the freshness of its pride\nThe foliage of the ever-verdant trees;\nBut fruits are ever ripe, flowers ever fair,\nAnd autumn proudly bears her matron grace, 120\nKindling a flush on the fair cheek of spring,\nWhose virgin bloom beneath the ruddy fruit\nReflects its tint and blushes into love.\n\n'The lion now forgets to thirst for blood;\nThere might you see him sporting in the sun\nBeside the dreadless kid; his claws are sheathed,\nHis teeth are harmless, custom's force has made\nHis nature as the nature of a lamb.\nLike passion's fruit, the nightshade's tempting bane\nPoisons no more the pleasure it bestows; 130\nAll bitterness is past; the cup of joy\nUnmingled mantles to the goblet's brim\nAnd courts the thirsty lips it fled before.\n\nBut chief, ambiguous man, he that can know\nMore misery, and dream more joy than all;\nWhose keen sensations thrill within his breast\nTo mingle with a loftier instinct there,\nLending their power to pleasure and to pain,\nYet raising, sharpening, and refining each;\nWho stands amid the ever-varying world, 140\nThe burden or the glory of the earth;\nHe chief perceives the change; his being notes\nThe gradual renovation and defines\nEach movement of its progress on his mind.\n\n'Man, where the gloom of the long polar night\nLowers o'er the snow-clad rocks and frozen soil,\nWhere scarce the hardiest herb that braves the frost\nBasks in the moonlight's ineffectual glow,\nShrank with the plants, and darkened with the night;\nHis chilled and narrow energies, his heart 150\nInsensible to courage, truth or love,\nHis stunted stature and imbecile frame,\nMarked him for some abortion of the earth,\nFit compeer of the bears that roamed around,\nWhose habits and enjoyments were his own;\nHis life a feverish dream of stagnant woe,\nWhose meagre wants, but scantily fulfilled,\nApprised him ever of the joyless length\nWhich his short being's wretchedness had reached;\nHis death a pang which famine, cold and toil 160\nLong on the mind, whilst yet the vital spark\nClung to the body stubbornly, had brought:\nAll was inflicted here that earth's revenge\nCould wreak on the infringers of her law;\nOne curse alone was spared--the name of God.\n\n'Nor, where the tropics bound the realms of day\nWith a broad belt of mingling cloud and flame,\nWhere blue mists through the unmoving atmosphere\nScattered the seeds of pestilence and fed\nUnnatural vegetation, where the land 170\nTeemed with all earthquake, tempest and disease,\nWas man a nobler being; slavery\nHad crushed him to his country's blood-stained dust;\nOr he was bartered for the fame of power,\nWhich, all internal impulses destroying,\nMakes human will an article of trade;\nOr he was changed with Christians for their gold\nAnd dragged to distant isles, where to the sound\nOf the flesh-mangling scourge he does the work\nOf all-polluting luxury and wealth, 180\nWhich doubly visits on the tyrants' heads\nThe long-protracted fulness of their woe;\nOr he was led to legal butchery,\nTo turn to worms beneath that burning sun\nWhere kings first leagued against the rights of men\nAnd priests first traded with the name of God.\n\n'Even where the milder zone afforded man\nA seeming shelter, yet contagion there,\nBlighting his being with unnumbered ills,\nSpread like a quenchless fire; nor truth till late 190\nAvailed to arrest its progress or create\nThat peace which first in bloodless victory waved\nHer snowy standard o'er this favored clime;\nThere man was long the train-bearer of slaves,\nThe mimic of surrounding misery,\nThe jackal of ambition's lion-rage,\nThe bloodhound of religion's hungry zeal.\n\n'Here now the human being stands adorning\nThis loveliest earth with taintless body and mind;\nBlest from his birth with all bland impulses, 200\nWhich gently in his noble bosom wake\nAll kindly passions and all pure desires.\nHim, still from hope to hope the bliss pursuing\nWhich from the exhaustless store of human weal\nDraws on the virtuous mind, the thoughts that rise\nIn time-destroying infiniteness gift\nWith self-enshrined eternity, that mocks\nThe unprevailing hoariness of age;\nAnd man, once fleeting o'er the transient scene\nSwift as an unremembered vision, stands 210\nImmortal upon earth; no longer now\nHe slays the lamb that looks him in the face,\nAnd horribly devours his mangled flesh,\nWhich, still avenging Nature's broken law,\nKindled all putrid humors in his frame,\nAll evil passions and all vain belief,\nHatred, despair and loathing in his mind,\nThe germs of misery, death, disease and crime.\nNo longer now the wing\u00e8d habitants,\nThat in the woods their sweet lives sing away, 220\nFlee from the form of man; but gather round,\nAnd prune their sunny feathers on the hands\nWhich little children stretch in friendly sport\nTowards these dreadless partners of their play.\nAll things are void of terror; man has lost\nHis terrible prerogative, and stands\nAn equal amidst equals; happiness\nAnd science dawn, though late, upon the earth;\nPeace cheers the mind, health renovates the frame;\nDisease and pleasure cease to mingle here, 230\nReason and passion cease to combat there;\nWhilst each unfettered o'er the earth extend\nTheir all-subduing energies, and wield\nThe sceptre of a vast dominion there;\nWhilst every shape and mode of matter lends\nIts force to the omnipotence of mind,\nWhich from its dark mine drags the gem of truth\nTo decorate its paradise of peace.'\n\nIX\n'O happy Earth, reality of Heaven!\nTo which those restless souls that ceaselessly\nThrong through the human universe, aspire!\nThou consummation of all mortal hope!\nThou glorious prize of blindly working will,\nWhose rays, diffused throughout all space and time,\nVerge to one point and blend forever there!\nOf purest spirits thou pure dwelling-place\nWhere care and sorrow, impotence and crime,\nLanguor, disease and ignorance dare not come! 10\nO happy Earth, reality of Heaven!\n\n'Genius has seen thee in her passionate dreams;\nAnd dim forebodings of thy loveliness,\nHaunting the human heart, have there entwined\nThose rooted hopes of some sweet place of bliss,\nWhere friends and lovers meet to part no more.\nThou art the end of all desire and will,\nThe product of all action; and the souls,\nThat by the paths of an aspiring change\nHave reached thy haven of perpetual peace, 20\nThere rest from the eternity of toil\nThat framed the fabric of thy perfectness.\n\n'Even Time, the conqueror, fled thee in his fear;\nThat hoary giant, who in lonely pride\nSo long had ruled the world that nations fell\nBeneath his silent footstep. Pyramids,\nThat for millenniums had withstood the tide\nOf human things, his storm-breath drove in sand\nAcross that desert where their stones survived\nThe name of him whose pride had heaped them there. 30\nYon monarch, in his solitary pomp,\nWas but the mushroom of a summer day,\nThat his light-wing\u00e8d footstep pressed to dust;\nTime was the king of earth; all things gave way\nBefore him but the fixed and virtuous will,\nThe sacred sympathies of soul and sense,\nThat mocked his fury and prepared his fall.\n\n'Yet slow and gradual dawned the morn of love;\nLong lay the clouds of darkness o'er the scene,\nTill from its native heaven they rolled away: 40\nFirst, crime triumphant o'er all hope careered\nUnblushing, undisguising, bold and strong,\nWhilst falsehood, tricked in virtue's attributes,\nLong sanctified all deeds of vice and woe,\nTill, done by her own venomous sting to death,\nShe left the moral world without a law,\nNo longer fettering passion's fearless wing,\nNor searing reason with the brand of God.\nThen steadily the happy ferment worked;\nReason was free; and wild though passion went 50\nThrough tangled glens and wood-embosomed meads,\nGathering a garland of the strangest flowers,\nYet, like the bee returning to her queen,\nShe bound the sweetest on her sister's brow,\nWho meek and sober kissed the sportive child,\nNo longer trembling at the broken rod.\n\n'Mild was the slow necessity of death.\nThe tranquil spirit failed beneath its grasp,\nWithout a groan, almost without a fear,\nCalm as a voyager to some distant land, 60\nAnd full of wonder, full of hope as he.\nThe deadly germs of languor and disease\nDied in the human frame, and purity\nBlessed with all gifts her earthly worshippers.\nHow vigorous then the athletic form of age!\nHow clear its open and unwrinkled brow!\nWhere neither avarice, cunning, pride or care\nHad stamped the seal of gray deformity\nOn all the mingling lineaments of time.\nHow lovely the intrepid front of youth, 70\nWhich meek-eyed courage decked with freshest grace;\nCourage of soul, that dreaded not a name,\nAnd elevated will, that journeyed on\nThrough life's phantasmal scene in fearlessness,\nWith virtue, love and pleasure, hand in hand!\n\n'Then, that sweet bondage which is freedom's self,\nAnd rivets with sensation's softest tie\nThe kindred sympathies of human souls,\nNeeded no fetters of tyrannic law.\nThose delicate and timid impulses 80\nIn Nature's primal modesty arose,\nAnd with undoubting confidence disclosed\nThe growing longings of its dawning love,\nUnchecked by dull and selfish chastity,\nThat virtue of the cheaply virtuous,\nWho pride themselves in senselessness and frost.\nNo longer prostitution's venomed bane\nPoisoned the springs of happiness and life;\nWoman and man, in confidence and love,\nEqual and free and pure together trod 90\nThe mountain-paths of virtue, which no more\nWere stained with blood from many a pilgrim's feet.\n\n'Then, where, through distant ages, long in pride\nThe palace of the monarch-slave had mocked\nFamine's faint groan and penury's silent tear,\nA heap of crumbling ruins stood, and threw\nYear after year their stones upon the field,\nWakening a lonely echo; and the leaves\nOf the old thorn, that on the topmost tower\nUsurped the royal ensign's grandeur, shook 100\nIn the stern storm that swayed the topmost tower,\nAnd whispered strange tales in the whirlwind's ear.\n\n'Low through the lone cathedral's roofless aisles\nThe melancholy winds a death-dirge sung.\nIt were a sight of awfulness to see\nThe works of faith and slavery, so vast,\nSo sumptuous, yet so perishing withal,\nEven as the corpse that rests beneath its wall!\nA thousand mourners deck the pomp of death\nTo-day, the breathing marble glows above 110\nTo decorate its memory, and tongues\nAre busy of its life; to-morrow, worms\nIn silence and in darkness seize their prey.\n\n'Within the massy prison's mouldering courts,\nFearless and free the ruddy children played,\nWeaving gay chaplets for their innocent brows\nWith the green ivy and the red wall-flower\nThat mock the dungeon's unavailing gloom;\nThe ponderous chains and gratings of strong iron\nThere rusted amid heaps of broken stone 120\nThat mingled slowly with their native earth;\nThere the broad beam of day, which feebly once\nLighted the cheek of lean captivity\nWith a pale and sickly glare, then freely shone\nOn the pure smiles of infant playfulness;\nNo more the shuddering voice of hoarse despair\nPealed through the echoing vaults, but soothing notes\nOf ivy-fingered winds and gladsome birds\nAnd merriment were resonant around.\n\n'These ruins soon left not a wreck behind; 130\nTheir elements, wide-scattered o'er the globe,\nTo happier shapes were moulded, and became\nMinistrant to all blissful impulses;\nThus human things were perfected, and earth,\nEven as a child beneath its mother's love,\nWas strengthened in all excellence, and grew\nFairer and nobler with each passing year.\n\n'Now Time his dusky pennons o'er the scene\nCloses in steadfast darkness, and the past\nFades from our charm\u00e8d sight. My task is done; 140\nThy lore is learned. Earth's wonders are thine own\nWith all the fear and all the hope they bring.\nMy spells are passed; the present now recurs.\nAh me! a pathless wilderness remains\nYet unsubdued by man's reclaiming hand.\n\n'Yet, human Spirit! bravely hold thy course;\nLet virtue teach thee firmly to pursue\nThe gradual paths of an aspiring change;\nFor birth and life and death, and that strange state\nBefore the naked soul has found its home, 150\nAll tend to perfect happiness, and urge\nThe restless wheels of being on their way,\nWhose flashing spokes, instinct with infinite life,\nBicker and burn to gain their destined goal;\nFor birth but wakes the spirit to the sense\nOf outward shows, whose unexperienced shape\nNew modes of passion to its frame may lend;\nLife is its state of action, and the store\nOf all events is aggregated there\nThat variegate the eternal universe; 160\nDeath is a gate of dreariness and gloom,\nThat leads to azure isles and beaming skies\nAnd happy regions of eternal hope.\nTherefore, O Spirit! fearlessly bear on.\nThough storms may break the primrose on its stalk,\nThough frosts may blight the freshness of its bloom,\nYet spring's awakening breath will woo the earth\nTo feed with kindliest dews its favorite flower,\nThat blooms in mossy bank and darksome glens,\nLighting the greenwood with its sunny smile. 170\n\n'Fear not then, Spirit, death's disrobing hand,\nSo welcome when the tyrant is awake,\nSo welcome when the bigot's hell-torch burns;\n'T is but the voyage of a darksome hour,\nThe transient gulf-dream of a startling sleep.\nDeath is no foe to virtue; earth has seen\nLove's brightest roses on the scaffold bloom,\nMingling with freedom's fadeless laurels there,\nAnd presaging the truth of visioned bliss.\nAre there not hopes within thee, which this scene 180\nOf linked and gradual being has confirmed?\nWhose stingings bade thy heart look further still,\nWhen, to the moonlight walk by Henry led,\nSweetly and sadly thou didst talk of death?\nAnd wilt thou rudely tear them from thy breast,\nListening supinely to a bigot's creed,\nOr tamely crouching to the tyrant's rod,\nWhose iron thongs are red with human gore?\nNever: but bravely bearing on, thy will\nIs destined an eternal war to wage 190\nWith tyranny and falsehood, and uproot\nThe germs of misery from the human heart.\nThine is the hand whose piety would soothe\nThe thorny pillow of unhappy crime,\nWhose impotence an easy pardon gains,\nWatching its wanderings as a friend's disease;\nThine is the brow whose mildness would defy\nIts fiercest rage, and brave its sternest will,\nWhen fenced by power and master of the world.\nThou art sincere and good; of resolute mind, 200\nFree from heart-withering custom's cold control,\nOf passion lofty, pure and unsubdued.\nEarth's pride and meanness could not vanquish thee,\nAnd therefore art thou worthy of the boon\nWhich thou hast now received; virtue shall keep\nThy footsteps in the path that thou hast trod,\nAnd many days of beaming hope shall bless\nThy spotless life of sweet and sacred love.\nGo, happy one, and give that bosom joy,\nWhose sleepless spirit waits to catch 210\nLight, life and rapture from thy smile!'\n\nThe Fairy waves her wand of charm.\nSpeechless with bliss the Spirit mounts the car,\nThat rolled beside the battlement,\nBending her beamy eyes in thankfulness.\nAgain the enchanted steeds were yoked;\nAgain the burning wheels inflame\nThe steep descent of heaven's untrodden way.\nFast and far the chariot flew;\nThe vast and fiery globes that rolled 220\nAround the Fairy's palace-gate\nLessened by slow degrees, and soon appeared\nSuch tiny twinklers as the planet orbs\nThat there attendant on the solar power\nWith borrowed light pursued their narrower way.\n\nEarth floated then below;\nThe chariot paused a moment there;\nThe Spirit then descended;\nThe restless coursers pawed the ungenial soil,\nSnuffed the gross air, and then, their errand done, 230\nUnfurled their pinions to the winds of heaven.\n\nThe Body and the Soul united then.\nA gentle start convulsed Ianthe's frame;\nHer veiny eyelids quietly unclosed;\nMoveless awhile the dark blue orbs remained.\nShe looked around in wonder, and beheld\nHenry, who kneeled in silence by her couch,\nWatching her sleep with looks of speechless love,\nAnd the bright beaming stars\nThat through the casement shone. 240Embed"}, {"name": "Auf Achse", "artist": "Franz Ferdinand", "lyrics": "Auf Achse Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou see her, you can't touch her\nYou hear her, you can't hold her\nYou want her,

peaceful lives\nInnocent of the litany of excess and violence\nThat was growing in the world below\nTo live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough\nThen one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town\nThey came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses\nBut no one noticed them, they only saw shadows\nYou see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind\n[Interlude: 2D]\nFalling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes\nWaiting for the sunset to come, people going home\nJump out from behind them and shoot them in the head\nNow everybody dancing, the dance of the dead\nThe dance of the dead, the dance of the dead\n\n[Verse 2: Dennis Hopper]\nIn time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain\nAnd it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty\nBy chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest\nThe Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things\nAnd soon they began to mine the mountain\nIts rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world\nMeanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly\nTheir dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls\nEvery day, people would wake and stare at the mountain\nWhy was it bringing darkness into their lives?\nAnd as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear\nBringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey\nFor the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful\nFor they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep\nAnd then came a sound, distant at first, it grew into castrophany\nSo immense that it could be heard far away in space\nThere were no screams, there was no time\nThe mountain called Monkey had spoken\nThere was only fire, and then... nothing\nSee Gorillaz LiveGet tickets as low as $94You might also like[Outro: 2D]\nOh, little town in the USA, your time
