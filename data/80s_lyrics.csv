"a tragic dawn lyricsas his cab turned by the end of the pont royal towards the gare d'orsay, m. etienne rambert looked at his watch and found, as he had anticipated, that he had a good quarter of an hour before the train that he intended to take was due to start. he called a porter, and gave him the heavy valise and the bundle of rugs that formed the whole of his hand baggage.  ""where is the office for forwarding luggage, my man?"" he enquired.  the porter led him through the famous panelled hall of the gare d'orsay, and m. etienne rambert satisfied himself that his trunks had been properly registered for verrières, the station at which he had to alight for the château of beaulieu.  still attended by the porter, who had conceived a respectful admiration for him in consequence of the authoritative tone in which he demanded information from the various railway servants, and who scented a probable munificent tip, m. etienne rambert proceeded to the booking-office and took a first-class ticket. he spent a few minutes more at the book-stall where he selected an imposing collection of illustrated papers, and then, his final preparations completed, he turned once more to the porter.  ""the luchon train,"" he said; ""where is it?"" and as the man only made a vague gesture and growled something wholly indistinct, he added: ""lead the way, and i will follow.""  it was now just half-past eight, and the station showed all the animation inseparable from the departure of main-line trains. m. etienne rambert hurried onwards, and reaching the platform from which all the lines begin, was stayed by the porter who was laden with his baggage. ""you want the express, sir?""  ""no, the slow train, my man.""  the porter showed some surprise, but made no remark.  ""do you like the front or the back of the train?""  ""the back by choice.""  ""first-class, isn't it?""  ""yes, first-class.""  the porter, who had stopped a moment, picked up the heavy valise again.  ""then there isn't any choice. there are only two first-class carriages on the slow train, and they are both in the middle.""  ""they are corridor carriages, i suppose?"" said etienne rambert.  ""yes, sir; there are hardly any others on the main-line trains, especially first-class.""  in the ever-increasing crowd etienne rambert had some difficulty in following the porter. the gare d'orsay has little or none of the attractiveness of the other stations, which cannot fail to have a certain fascination for any imaginative person, who thinks of the mystery attaching to all those iron rails reaching out into the distance of countries unknown to him. it is less noisy than the others also, for between austerlitz and orsay the traction is entirely electric. and further, there is no clearly defined separation between the main and the suburban lines.  on the right of the platform was the train which was to take etienne rambert beyond brives to verrières, the slow train to luchon; and on the left of the same platform was another train for juvisy and all the small stations in the suburbs of paris. very few people were making for the train to luchon; but a large crowd was pressing into the suburban train.  the porter who was piloting m. etienne rambert, set the baggage he was carrying down on the footboard of a first-class carriage.  ""there is no one for the slow train yet, sir; if you like to get in first you can choose your own compartment.""  m. etienne rambert acted on the suggestion, but he had hardly set foot in the corridor before the guard, also scenting a generous tip, came to offer his services.  ""it really is the 8.50 you want, sir?"" was his first enquiry. ""you are sure you are not making a mistake?""  ""no,"" etienne rambert replied. ""why?""  ""a great many first-class passengers do make a mistake,"" the man explained, ""and confuse the 8.50 with the 8.45 express.""  as he spoke the guard took the baggage from the porter who had remained on the platform, and the porter, after being generously remunerated for his trouble by m. rambert, hurried away to look for other travellers.  ""the 8.45 is the express, isn't it?"" m. rambert enquired.  ""yes,"" the guard answered; ""it runs right through without stopping at all the small stations as this train does. it goes in front of this one and gets to luchon three hours earlier. there it is on the side there,"" and he pointed through the window in the door on the far side to another train on the next rails, in which a number of travellers were already taking their seats. ""if you prefer to go by that one, sir,"" he went on, ""there is still time for you to change; you are entitled to take your choice since you have a first-class ticket.""  but etienne rambert, after a moment's consideration, declined the suggestion.  ""no: i would rather go by the slow train. if i take the express i should have to get out at brives, and then i should be twelve or thirteen miles from saint-jaury, which is my destination; whereas the slow train stops at verrières, where, by the way, i have already telegraphed to say i shall arrive to-morrow morning.""  he walked a little way along the corridor, assuring himself that the various compartments were still quite empty, and then turned to the guard. ""look here, my man,"" he said, ""i am awfully tired, and i mean to get some sleep to-night; consequently i should like to be alone. now where shall i be most quiet and undisturbed?""  the man understood. m. etienne rambert's enquiry about the place where he would be most quiet, was an implicit promise of a handsome tip if nobody did disturb him.  ""if you like to settle yourself here, sir,"" the man answered, ""you can draw down the blinds at once, and i dare say i shall be able to find room for any other passengers somewhere else.""  ""good,"" said m. rambert, moving towards the compartment indicated. ""i will smoke a cigar until the train starts, and immediately afterwards i will settle down to sleep. by the way, my man, since you seem so obliging, i wish you would undertake to call me to-morrow morning in time for me to get out at verrières. i am desperately sleepy and i am quite capable of not waking up.""  the guard touched his cap.  ""you can be perfectly easy, sir, and sleep without the least anxiety. i won't fail.""  ""very well.""  when his baggage had been stowed away, and his rugs spread out to make the seat more comfortable still, m. etienne rambert repeated his appeal, for he was an old traveller and knew that it does not do to rely too much upon the promises of chance attendants.  ""i can rely upon you, can't i? i may sleep as sound as i like, and you will wake me at verrières?"" and the more to assure himself that the guard would execute his orders he slipped a franc into his hand.  when he was left alone, m. rambert continued his preparations for the night. he carefully drew down the blinds over the door and over the windows of the compartment that gave on to the corridor, and also lowered the shade over the electric light, and then, in order to enjoy the last puffs at his cigar in peace, he opened the window over the other door and leant his elbows on it, watching the final preparations being made by the travellers by the express on the other line.  the departure of a train is always a picturesque sight, and m. rambert leant forward inquisitively to note how the passengers had installed themselves in the two compartments which he could see from his coign of vantage.  there were not many people in the train. as a matter of fact the brives and luchon line is not much used at this time of year. if the number of passengers in the express were any criterion etienne rambert might reasonably expect that he would be the only one in the slow train. but there was not much time for observations and reflections of this kind. on the platform for the express, which he got a glimpse of through the compartments, people were hurrying up their farewells. the passengers had got into their carriages, and the friends who had come to see them off were standing alone upon the platform. there was the sound of safety locks being fastened by porters, and the noise of trollies being wheeled along bearing articles for sale.  ""pillows! rugs! sweets! papers!""  then came the whistle of the guard, the shriller scream from the electric engine, and then, slowly at first but steadily, more rapidly as the engine got up speed, the express moved along the platform and plunged into the tunnel on the way to austerlitz.  meanwhile the guard of the slow train was doing wonders. shamelessly resolved to assure perfect quiet to ""his"" passenger, he managed, without unduly compromising himself but yet without leaving any doubt about it in any mind, to insinuate discreetly that m. rambert's carriage was reserved, so that that gentleman might count upon an entirely undisturbed night.  a few minutes after the express had gone, the slow train drew out in its turn, and disappeared into the darkness of the underground tunnel.  at the château of beaulieu young charles rambert was just finishing dressing when a gentle tap sounded on the door of his room.  ""it is a quarter to five, charles. get up at once!""  ""i am awake already, thérèse,"" charles rambert answered with some pride. ""i shall be ready in two minutes.""  ""what? up already?"" the girl exclaimed from the other side of the door. ""marvelous! i congratulate you. i'm ready too; i will wait for you in the dining-room. come down as soon as you are dressed.""  ""all right!"" the young man answered.  he wasted no time over his toilette, the more so because it was none too warm in his room, for at this early hour it was still quite dark; and then taking his light in one hand he opened his door carefully so as to make no noise, tip-toed along the landing, and went down the staircase to join thérèse in the dining-room. the girl was an accomplished housekeeper already, and while waiting for the young fellow she had got a scratch meal together.  ""let us have breakfast quickly,"" she suggested; ""it isn't snowing this morning, and if you like we might walk to the station. we have plenty of time, and it will do us good to have a walk.""  ""it will warm us up anyhow,"" charles rambert replied; he was only half-awake, but he sat beside thérèse, and did justice to the preparations she had made.  ""do you know that it is very wonderful of you to get up so punctually?"" mme. de langrune's granddaughter remarked. ""how did you manage it? last night you were afraid you would sleep on as usual.""  ""it was not much trouble for me to wake up,"" charles rambert answered. ""i hardly closed an eye all night.""  ""but i promised to come and knock at your door myself, so you might have slept without any anxiety.""  ""that's so, but to tell you the truth, thérèse, i was regularly upset and excited by the thought of papa arriving this morning.""  they had both finished breakfast, and thérèse got up.  ""shall we start?"" she asked.  ""yes.""  thérèse opened the hall door, and the two young people went down the flight of steps leading to the garden. the girl had thrown a big cloak over her shoulders, and she inhaled the pure morning air with keen delight.  ""i love going out in the early morning,"" she declared.  ""well, i don't like it at all,"" charles rambert confessed with characteristic candour. ""good lord, how cold it is! and it is still pitch dark!""  ""surely you are not going to be frightened?"" said thérèse teasingly.  charles rambert made an irritable movement of vexation and surprise.  ""frightened? what do you take me for, thérèse? if i don't like going out in the early morning it's really only because it is cold.""  she laughed at him while they were crossing the lawn towards the out-buildings, through which she meant to get out on to the high road. as they passed the stables they came across a groom who was leisurely getting an old brougham out of the coach-house.  ""don't hurry, jean,"" thérèse called out as she greeted him. ""we are going to walk to the station, and the only important thing is that you should be there to bring us back.""  the man touched his cap and the two young people passed through the park gate and found themselves upon the high road.  it was still very dark, with just a wan reflection in the distance of the sky vaguely outlining some cloud-shapes to the eastward to give some promise of the day. there was no sound to break the silence of the fields, and as they walked briskly along charles and thérèse could hear their footsteps ringing on the hard surface of the frozen ground.  ""it must please you awfully to be going to meet your father,"" said mme. de langrune's granddaughter half questioningly. ""it is a long time since you have seen him, isn't it?""  ""three years,"" charles rambert answered, ""and then just for a few minutes. he is coming home from america now, and before that he travelled in spain for a long time.""  ""he was travelling the whole time you were a child, wasn't he?""  ""yes, always: either in colombia, looking after his rubber plantations there, or in spain, where he has a good deal of property too. when he was in paris he used to come to the school and ask for me, and i saw him in the parlour—for a quarter of an hour.""  ""and your mother?""  ""oh, mamma was different. you know, thérèse, i spent all  the childhood that i can remember at the school. i liked the masters and had good chums, and was very happy there, and if the truth must be told i looked forward with anything but pleasure to the holidays, when i had to go to my parents' house. i always felt a stranger with them; my real home was the school-room, where i had my desk and all my own interests. and then, you know, when one is little one doesn't understand things much; i didn't feel having hardly any family, very much.""  ""but you loved your mother very much?""  thérèse asked the question quite anxiously, and it was patent that she would have thought it dreadful if her companion had not had a real affection for his mother.  ""oh, yes, i loved her,"" charles rambert answered; ""but i hardly knew her either."" and as thérèse showed her surprise he went on, telling her something of the secret of his lonely childhood. ""you see, thérèse, now that i am a man i guess lots of things that i could not have had even a suspicion of then. my father and mother did not get on well together. they were what you call an ill-assorted couple. they were both very good, but their characters did not harmonise. when i was little i always saw mamma silent and sad, and papa active and on the go, and bright and talking at the top of his voice. i half believe he frightened mamma! and then my father was constantly away, whereas mamma hardly ever went out. when a servant took me to the house on thursdays, i was taken up to say good morning to her, and i invariably found her lying on a sofa in her room, with the blinds down and almost dark. she just touched me with her lips and asked me one or two questions, and then i was taken away again because i tired her.""  ""was she ill, then?""  ""mamma always has been ill. i suppose you know, thérèse, that three months ago—stay, it was just when i had taken my degree and went to germany—she was sent to an asylum? i believe my father had wanted her to agree to undergo careful treatment of the kind long before, but she would not.""  thérèse was silent for a few minutes.  ""you have not been very happy,"" she said presently.  ""oh, it was only after i grew up that i felt unhappy. when i was a little chap i never thought of how sad it is to have no real father or mother. the last four or five years it has hurt me, but when he came to see me once at school, papa told me he would take me with him as soon as i had taken my degree and grown up. last october, after my examination, he wrote and told me to be patient a little longer, and that he was hurrying on with the winding up of his business and coming back to france. that gave me a hope which has brightened these last few months, and will also make you understand why i am so pleased this morning at my fathers coming. it seems to me that a new life is going to begin.""  day was breaking now: a dirty december day, with the light filtering through heavy grey clouds that drifted along the ground, hid the horizon, clung to the low hills, and then suddenly dispersed in long wisps driven by a keen breeze, that got up in gusts, and drove clouds of dust along the hard frozen ground.  ""i have not been very happy either,"" said thérèse, ""for i lost my father when i was tiny: i don't even remember him; and mamma must be dead as well.""  the ambiguous turning of the child's phrase caught charles rambert's interested attention.  ""what does that mean, thérèse? don't you know if your mother is dead?""  ""yes, oh yes; grandmamma says so. but whenever i ask for particulars grandmamma always changes the subject. i will echo what you said just now: when you are little you don't know anything and are not surprised at anything. for a long time i took no notice of her sudden reticence, but now i sometimes wonder if something is not being kept back from me—whether it is really true that mamma is no more in this world.""  talking like this thérèse and charles had walked at a good pace, and now they came to the few houses built around verrières station. one by one, bedroom windows and doors were being opened; peasants were making their way to the sheds to lead their cattle to the pastures.  ""we are very early,"" thérèse remarked, pointing to the station clock in the distance. ""your father's train is due at 6.55, and it is only 6.40 now; we still have a quarter of an hour to wait, and more, if the train is not punctual!""  they went into the little station and charles rambert, thankful for some shelter from the cold, stamped his feet, making a sudden uproar in the empty waiting-room. a porter appeared.  ""who the deuce is kicking up all this row?"" he began angrily, and then seeing thérèse, broke off short. ""ah, mademoiselle thérèse,"" he said with the familiar yet perfectly respectful cordiality that marks country folk, ""up already? have you come to meet somebody, or are you going away?""  as he spoke, the porter turned a curious eye upon charles rambert, whose arrival had caused quite a sensation two days before in this little spot, where with but few exceptions none but people belonging to the neighbourhood ever came by train.  ""no, i am not going away,"" thérèse replied. ""i have accompanied m. rambert, who has come to meet his father.""  ""ah-ha, to meet your papa, sir: is he coming from far?""  ""from paris,"" charles rambert answered. ""is the train signalled yet?""  the man drew out a watch like a turnip, and looked at the time.  ""it won't be here for quite another twenty minutes. the work on the tunnel makes it necessary to be careful, and it's always late now. but you will hear when the bell rings: that will be when the train is coming over the level-crossing; it will run into the station three minutes after that. well, mademoiselle, i must get on with my work,"" and the man left them.  thérèse turned to charles rambert.  ""shall we go on to the platform? then we shall see the train come in.""  so they left the waiting-room and began to walk up and down the whole length of the platform. thérèse watched the jerky movements of the hands of the clock, and smiled at her companion.  ""five minutes more, and your father will be here! four minutes more! ah! there it is!"" and she pointed to a slope in the distance where a slight trail of smoke rose white against the blue of the sky, now clear of cloud. ""can't you see it? that is the steam from the engine coming out of the tunnel.""  ere she finished speaking the quivering whir of the bell echoed through the empty station.  ""ah!"" said charles rambert: ""at last!""  the two porters who, with the stationmaster, constituted the entire railway staff at verrières, came bustling along the platform, and while the bell continued its monotonous whirring ring, pulled forward trucks in readiness for any possible luggage. puffing portentously, the engine slackened speed, and the heavy train slowed down and finally stopped, bringing a noisy atmosphere of life into the station of verrières that but a moment ago was so still.  the first-class carriages had stopped immediately in front of charles and thérèse, and on the footboard etienne rambert stood, a tall, elderly man of distinguished appearance, proud bearing and energetic attitude, with extraordinarily keen eyes and an unusually high and intelligent forehead. seeing thérèse and charles he seized his baggage and in a twinkling had sprung on to the platform. he dropped his valise, tossed his bundle of rugs on to a seat, and gripped charles by the two shoulders.  ""my boy!"" he exclaimed; ""my dear boy!""  although he had hitherto shown so little affection for his child, it was obvious that the man was making a great effort to restrain his emotion, and was really moved when he now saw him again as a grown young man.  nor, on his part, did charles rambert remain unmoved. as if the sudden grip of this almost stranger, who yet was his father, had awakened a world of memories within him, he turned very pale and his voice faltered as he replied:  ""papa! dear papa! i am so glad to see you!""  thérèse had drawn tactfully aside. m. rambert still held his son by the shoulders and stepped back a pace, the better to consider him.  ""why, you are a man! how you have altered, my boy! you are just what i hoped you would be: tall and strong! ah, you are my son all right! and you are quite well, hey? yet you look tired.""  ""i did not sleep well,"" charles explained with a smile. ""i was afraid i should not wake up.""  turning his head, m. rambert saw thérèse and held out his hand.  ""how do you do, my little thérèse?"" he exclaimed. ""you have altered too since i saw you last. i left a little chit of a child, and now i behold a grown-up young lady. well! i must be off at once to pay my respects to my dear old friend, your grandmother. all well at the château, eh?""  thérèse shook hands warmly with m. rambert and thanked him prettily.  ""grandmamma is very well; she told me to tell you to excuse her if she did not come to meet you, but her doctor says she must not get up very early.""  ""of course your grandmamma is excused, my dear. besides, i have to thank her for her kindness to charles, and for the hospitality she is going to extend to me for a few days.""  meanwhile the train had gone on again, and now a porter came up to m. rambert.  ""will you take your luggage with you, sir?""  recalled to material things, etienne rambert contemplated his trunk which the porters had taken out of the luggage van.  ""good lord!"" he began, but thérèse interrupted him.  ""grandmamma said she would send for your heavy luggage during the morning, and that you could take your valise and any small parcels with us in the brougham.""  ""what's that? your grandmamma has taken the trouble to send her carriage?""  ""it's a long way to beaulieu, you know,"" thérèse replied. ""ask charles if it isn't. we came on foot and the walk would be too tiring for you after a whole night in the train.""  the three had reached the station yard, and thérèse stopped in surprise.  ""why, how's that?"" she exclaimed; ""the carriage is not here.  and yet jean was beginning to get it ready when we left the château.""  m. etienne rambert was resting one hand on his son's shoulder, and contemplating him with an affectionate, all-embracing survey every now and then. he smiled at thérèse.  ""he may have been delayed, dear. i tell you what we will do. since your grandmamma is going to send for my luggage there is no need for me to take my valise; we can leave everything in the cloak-room and start for the château on foot; if my memory serves me right—and it is a very good memory—there is only one road, so we shall meet jean and can get into the carriage on the way.""  a few minutes later all three set out on the road to beaulieu. m. rambert walked between the two young people; he had gallantly offered his arm to thérèse, who was not a little proud of the attention, which proved to her mind that she was now regarded as a grown-up young lady. on the other side of his father charles made answer to the incessant questions put to him.  m. etienne rambert enjoyed the walk in the quiet morning through the peaceful country-side. with a tender half-melancholy he recognised every turn in the road, every bit of scenery.  ""just fancy my coming back here at sixty years of age, with a great son of eighteen!"" he said with a laugh. ""and i remember as if it were yesterday the good times i have had at the château of beaulieu. mme. de langrune and i will have plenty of memories to talk over. gad! it must be quite forty years since i came this way, and yet i remember every bit of it. say, thérèse, isn't it the fact that we shall see the front of the château directly we have passed this little copse?""  ""quite true,"" the girl answered with a laugh. ""you know the country very well, sir.""  ""yes,"" said etienne rambert; ""when one gets to my age, little thérèse, one always does remember the happy days of one's youth; one remembers recent events much less distinctly. most likely that means, my dear, that the human heart declines to grow old and refuses to preserve any but pictures of childhood.""  for a few minutes m. rambert remained silent, as if absorbed in somewhat melancholy reflections. but he soon recovered himself and shook off the tender sadness evoked in his mind by memories of the past.  ""why, the park enclosure has been altered,"" he exclaimed. ""here is a wall which used not to be here: there was only a hedge.""  thérèse laughed.  ""i never knew the hedge,"" she said. ""i have always seen the wall.""  ""must we go on to the main gate?"" m. rambert asked, ""or has your grandmamma had another gate made?""  ""we are going in by the out-buildings,"" the girl answered; ""then we shall hear why jean did not come to meet us."" she opened a little door half-hidden among the moss and ivy that clothed the wall surrounding the park, and making m. rambert and charles pass in before her, cried: ""but jean has gone with the brougham, for the horses are not in the stable. how was it we did not meet him?"" then she laughed. ""poor jean! he is so muddle-headed! i would not mind betting he went to meet us at saint-jaury, as he does every morning to bring me home from church.""  the little company, etienne rambert, thérèse and charles, were now approaching the château. passing beneath mme. de langrune's windows thérèse called merrily up to them.  ""here we are, grandmamma!""  there was no reply.  but at the window of an adjoining room appeared the figure of the steward, dollon, making a gesture, as if asking for silence.  thérèse, in advance of her guests, had proceeded but a few yards when mme. de langrune's old servant rushed down the stone flight of steps in front of the château, towards m. rambert.  dollon seemed distraught. usually so respectful and so deferential in manner, he now seized m. rambert by the arm, and imperiously waving thérèse and charles away, drew him aside.  ""it is awful, sir,"" he exclaimed: ""horrible: a fearful thing has happened. we have just found mme. la marquise dead—murdered—in her room!""embed"

"arabian nights,vol. 2 (chap. 3) lyricstale of king omar bin al-nu'uman and his sons sharrkan and zau al-makan  and what befel them of things seld-seen and peregrine.   the king asked her, ""and what was their story?"" and she answered: it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that there was in the city of safety, baghdad, before the caliphate of abd al-malik bin marwán,  a king, omar bin al-nu'umán highs, who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the chosroës of persia and the kaysars of eastern rome; for none could warm himself at his fire;  nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray; and, when he was angered, there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame. he had made himself king over all quarters, and allah had subjected to him all his creatures; his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands. east and west had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them, hind and sind and sin,  the holy land, al-hijaz, the rich mountains of al-yaman and the archipelagos of india and china. moreover, he reigned supreme over the north country and diyár bakr, or mesopotamia, and over sudán, the eastern negro land and the islands of the ocean, and all the far famed rivers of the earth, sayhún and jayhún,  nile and euphrates. he sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote, to provide him with true report; and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace, with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for king omar bin al-nu'uman; for he was, o ruler of the age, a right noble king; and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing. this mighty monarch had a son yclept sharrkan,  who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban. for this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater, and made him heir to the kingdom after himself. this prince grew up till he reached man's estate and was twenty years old, and allah subjected his servants to him, by reason of his great might and prowess in battle. now his father, king omar, had four wives legally married, but allah had vouchsafed him no son by them, save sharrkan, whom he had begotten upon one of them, and the rest were barren. moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines, after the number of days in the coptic year, who were of all nations; and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace. for he had built twelve pavilions, after the number of the months, each containing thirty private chambers, which thus numbered three hundred and three score, wherein he lodged his handmaids: and he appointed according to law for each one her night, when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year;  and on this wise he abode for a length of time. meanwhile his son sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier; so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities. presently, by decree of the decreer, a handmaid among the handmaids of omar bin nu'uman became pregnant; and, her pregnancy being announced to the harim, the king was informed thereof; whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, ""haply it will be a son, and so all my offspring will be males!"" then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness. but when the tidings came to sharrkan, he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous; and he said, ""verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty:"" so quoth he to himself, ""if this concubine bear a male child i will kill it:"" but he kept that intention hidden in his heart. such was the case with sharrkan; but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows. she was a roumiyah, a greek girl, by name sofiyah or sophia,  whom the king of roum and lord of cæsarea had sent to king omar as a present, together with great store of gifts and of rarities: she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour; and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating. now she had served the king on the night of his sleeping with her, saying to him, ""o king! i desire of the god of the heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me, so i may bring him up with the best of rearing, and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence, good manners and prudent bearing"" —a speech which much pleased the king. during her pregnancy she was instant in prayer, fervently supplicating the lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her; and allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool.  now the king had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female; and in like way his son sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same. in due time sophia was delivered of a child, which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon. so they announced this to all present in the room, whereupon the king's messenger carried the news to him; and sharrkan's eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy. but, after the two had departed, quoth sophia to the midwives, ""wait with me awhile, for i feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb."" then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her; and allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child. the wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon, with forehead flower white, and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light; whereupon the mother rejoiced, as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company; and sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy.  the rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot; and the tidings reached omar son of al- nu'uman, who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news. then he rose and went to her and kissed her head, after which he looked at the boy; and, bending over him, kissed him, whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music; and the king gave order that the boy should be named zau al-makán and his sister nuzhat al-zamán.  they answered ""hearing and obedience,"" and did his bidding; so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them; and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside, beyond the power of tongue to rehearse. moreover the people of baghdad, hearing that allah had blessed their king with issue, decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom; and the emirs and wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished king omar bin al-nu'uman joy of his son, zau al-makan, and of his daughter nuzhat al-zaman, wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts, and dealt largesse to all, gentle and simple, who were present. after this fashion he did for four days full told, and he lavished upon sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth; and, every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new-borns. and when four years had gone by, he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions. all this while his son sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father, omar son of al-nu'uman, having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of nuzhat al-zaman; and they hid the intelligence from him, until days and years had sped by, whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights. one day, as king omar was sitting in his palace, his chamberlains came in to him and, kissing the ground before him, said, ""o king there be come ambassadors from the king of roum, lord of constantinople the great, and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree: if the king commend us to introduce them we will so do; and, if not, there is no disputing his behest."" he bade them enter and, when they came in, he turned to them and, courteously receiving them, asked them of their case, and what was the cause of their coming. they kissed the ground before him and said, ""o king glorious and strong! o lord of the arm that is long! know that he who despatched us to thee is king afrídún,  lord of ionia land  and of the nazarene armies, the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of constantinople, to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel, the prince of casarea; and the cause of this war is as follows. one of the kings of the arabs in past time, during certain of his conquests, chanced upon a hoard of the time of alexander,  whence he removed wealth past compute; and, amongst other things, three round jewels, big as ostrich eggs, from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man. upon each were graven characts in ionian characters, and they have many virtues and properties, amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new-born child, no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail, nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail.  when the arab king laid hands upon them and learned their secrets, he sent to king afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned; and he equipped for the mission two ships, one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas, albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels, for that he was king of the arabs, and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the king of constantinople and they were bound to his port; nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the great king, afridun. the two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city, when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the prince of caesarea, who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships, together with the three jewels, and slew the crews. when our king heard of this, he sent an army against them, but they routed it; then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight,—whereupon the king waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth  against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army; nor would he turn back from them till he had left caesarea, of armenia  in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her prince held sway. so he sent us to the lord of the age and the time, sultan omar bin al-nu'uman, king of baghdad and of khorasan, desiring that he aid us with an army, so may honour and glory accrue to him; and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents, and of the king's grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance."" then the ambassadors kissed the ground before him,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the forty-sixth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that, after the ambassadors and retinue from the constantinopolitan king had kissed the ground before omar and had delivered their embassage, they brought out the presents, which were fifty damsels of the choicest from graecia-land, and fifty mamelukes in tunics of brocade, belted with girdles of gold and silver, each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one. the girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money. when the king saw them, he rejoiced in them and accepted them; then he bade the ambassadors be honourably entreated and, summoning his wazirs, took counsel with them of what he should do. herewith rose up among them a wazir, an ancient man, dandan  highs, who kissed the ground before omar and said, ""o king, there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious, and set over it thy son sharrkan with us as his lieutenants; and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts; first, because the king of roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted; and, secondly, because while no enemy dareth attack our country, thine army may go forth safely and, should it succour the king of graecia-land and defeat his foe, the glory will be thine. moreover, the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially, when the tidings shall reach the islands of the ocean and the kings of mauritania shall hear it, they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money."" the king pleased by the wazir's words and approving his rede, gave him a dress of honour and said to him, ""of the like of thee should kings ask counsel, and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son sharrkan command the main battle."" then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down; and he expounded to him the matter, telling him what the ambassadors and the wazir dandan had said, and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign, enjoining him not to gainsay dandan in aught he should do. moreover, he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen, armed cap-à-pie and inured to onset and stress of war. accordingly, sharrkan arose on the instant, and chose out a myriad of horsemen, after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them, saying, ""ye have delay of three days."" they kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions, and provide provisions for the occasion; whilst sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour, and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others. when the appointed three days were ended, the army drew out to the suburbs of baghdad city;  and king omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the king seven parcels of money.  then he turned to danden and commended to his care the army of his son; and the wazir kissed the ground before him and answered, ""i hear and i obey;"" and lastly he charged sharrkan that he should consult the wazir on all occasions, which he promised to do. after this, the king returned to his city and sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array. so they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen, besides footmen and camp followers. then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled, whilst sharrkan mounted horse, with the wazir dandan by his side, and the colours fluttering over their heads. so the host fared forth and stinted not faring, with the ambassadors preceding them, till day departed and night drew nigh, when they alighted and encamped for the night. and as soon as allah caused the morn tomorrow, they mounted and tried on, guided by the ambassadors, for a space of twenty days; and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious wady well grown with trees and shrubbery. here sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days' halt, so they dismounted and pitched their tents, spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley, whilst the wazir dandan and the ambassadors of king afridun pitched in the sole of the wady.  as for sharrkan, he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides; he then slacked the reins of his steed, being minded to explore the wady and to mount guard in his own person, because of his father's charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of graecia land and in the enemy's country. so he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the wazir dandan, and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed, when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him, so that he could no longer urge horse with heel. now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback; so when slumber overpowered him, he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets  which was dense with growth; but sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground. then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees, and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons, eastern and western. he was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yet shamed its sayer, ""there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah, the glorious, the great!"" but as he rode on, in fear of wild beasts, behold, the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of paradise; and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men. so king sharrkan alighted and, tying his steed to one of the trees, went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in arabic and saying, ""now by the crush of the messiah, this is not well of you! but whose utters a word, i will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle !"" he kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold, a stream was gushing and flowing, and antelopes at large were frisking and roving, and wild cattle amid the pasture moving, and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues, and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs, even as a poet described it in these couplets,  ""most beautiful is earth in budding bloom, * when lucid waters             course through plain and wood: no work but his th' all great, th' all glorious, * giver of all             gifts, giver of all good!"" and as sharrkan considered the place, he saw in it a christian monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon.  through the midst of the convent passed a stream, the water flowing amongst its gardens; and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard, while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder, high bosomed virgins, as saith of them the poet in these couplets,  ""the mead is bright with what is on't * of merry maidens             debonnair: double its beauty and its grace * those trooping damsels slender-            fair: virgins of graceful swimming gait * ready with eye and lip to             ensnare; and like the tendril'd vine they loose * the rich profusion of             their hair: shooting their shafts and arrows from * beautiful eyes beyond           compare; overpowering and transpiercing * every froward adversaire.""  sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest, with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white, and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright, and temple locks like the scorpion's tail; and she was perfect in essence and attributes, as the poet said of her in these couplets,  ""she beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance, * and her             straight slender stature enshamed the lance: she burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red, * where all manner of             beauties have habitance: and the locks on her forehead were lowering as night * whence             issues a dawn tide of happiest chance.""  then sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids, ""come ye on, that i may wrestle with you and gravel you, ere the moon set and the dawn break!"" so each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright, and pinioned them with their girdles, and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all. then there turned to her an old woman who was before her, and the beldam said as in wrath, ""o strumpet, cost thou glory in grounding these girls? behold i am an old woman, yet have i thrown them forty times! so what hast thou to boast of? but if thou have the strength to wrestle with me, stand up that i may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels!"" the young lady smiled at her words, but she was filled with inward wrath, and she jumped up and asked, ""o my lady zat al-dawahi,  by the truth of the messiah, wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed, or dost thou jest with me?""; and she answered, ""yea,""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the forty-seventh night, she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the young lady asked zat al-dawahi, ""by the truth of the messiah, wilt wrestle with me or dost jest?"", and she answered, ""yea, i will wrestle with thee in very deed"" (sharrkan looking on the while), the damsel cried, ""rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do."" when the old woman heard this, she raged with exceeding rage, and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog.  then she sprang to her feet, whilst the damsel stood up to her, and said, ""now by the truth of the messiah, i will not wrestle with thee unless i be naked, mistress whore!""  so she loosed her petticoat trousers and, putting her hand under her clothes, tore them off her body; then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape, girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head if ritah or a spotted snake. with this she inclined towards the damsel and said, ""do thou as i have done."" all this time, sharrkan was gazing at the twain, and laughing at the beldam's loathly semblance. so the damsel leisurely rose and, taking a sash of yamani stuff, passed it twice round her waist, then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal, smooth and rounded, and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples, as it were a bed of nu'uman's anemones; and breasts like double pomegranates. then the old woman leant towards her, and the two laid hold either of each, while sharrkan raised his head heavenwards and prayed allah that the belle might beat the beldam. presently the young woman get beneath the old woman; and, gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand, hoisted her off the ground with both; whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and, in so doing fell on her back arsiversy, with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine; furthermore she let fly two great farts  one of which blew up the dust from the earth's face and the other steamed up to the gate of heaven. sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground. then he arose and, baring his brand looked right and left, but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back, and said to himself, ""he lied not who named thee lady of calamities! verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others."" so he drew near them to hear what should pass between them. then the young lady went up to the old one and, throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness, helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying, ""o my lady zat al- dawahi, i intended only to throw thee and not all this, but thou triedst to twist out of my hands; so laud to allah for safety!"" she returned her no answer, but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight, leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned, with the fair damsel standing amongst them. quoth sharrkan to himself, ""every luck hath its cause. sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune; for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me."" so he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled  him on, when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath, which he brandished shouting the while his war cry, ""allah is all mighty !"" when the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and, taking firm stand on the bank of the stream, whose breadth was six ells, the normal cubits, made one bound and landed clear on the farther side,  where she turned and cried out with a loud voice, ""who art thou, o thou fellow, that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime, and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host? whence camest thou and whither art thou going? speak sooth, for truth will stand thee in good stead, and lie not, for lies come of villein breed doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way, that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies; for thou art now in an open plain and, did we shout but a single shout, would come to our rescue four thousand knights.  so tell me what thou wantest; and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road, we will do so."" when sharrkan heard her words he replied, ""i am a stranger of the moslems, who fared forth this night single handed, seeking for spoil; nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens; so i shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them."" quoth she, ""i would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it; and, as for the handmaids, by allah, they shall never be thy spoil. have i not told thee that to lie is villein vile?"" quoth he, ""the wise man is he who taketh warning by others."" thereupon quoth she, ""by the truth of the messiah, did i not fear that thy death would be on my hands, i would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might, but i take pity upon the stranger. so, if thou seek booty, i require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me, by thy faith, that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand, and we will wrestle, i and thou. if thou throw me, set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty; but if i throw thee, thou shalt become under my command. swear this to me, for i fear thy treachery: indeed it hath become a common saw, 'where perfidy is innate there trust is a weakly mate.' now an thou wilt swear i will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee."" answered sharrkan (and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul, ""truly she knoweth not that i am a champion of champions""); ""swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding, and i will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest, 'draw near that i wrestle with thee.' if thou throw me, i have money where withal to ransom myself; and if i throw thee, 'twill be booty and booty enough for me!"" rejoined the damsel, ""i am content herewith!"" and sharrkan was astounded at her words and said, ""and by the truth of the apostle (whom allah bless and keep!) i too am content on the other part!"" then said she, ""swear to me by him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright, that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling; else mayst thou die without the pale of al- islam."" sharrkan replied, ""by allah! were a kazi to swear me, even though he were a kazi of the kazis,  he would not impose upon me such an oath as this!"" then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree; but he was drowned in the sea of thought, saying in himself, ""praise be to him who fashioned her from dirty water!""  then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling, and said to her, ""cross the stream to me;"" but she replied, ""it is not for me to come over to thee: if thou wilt, pass thou over here to me."" ""i cannot do that,"" quoth he, and quoth she, ""o boy, i will come across to thee."" so she tucked up her skirts and, leaping, landed on the other side of the stream by his side; whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms.  but he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness; for he saw a shape which the hand of power had tanned with the dye leaves of the jann, which had been fostered by the hand of beneficence and fanned by the zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted. then she called out to him, ""o moslem, come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning,"" and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd, which illumined the whole place with its whiteness; and sharrkan was dazzled by it. then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge, she doing the like, and caught hold of her, and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms. presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist, when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle, breeding languishment, and he fell a trembling like the persian reed in the roaring gale. so she lifted him up and, throwing him to the ground, sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand, for his soul had lost mastery over his senses. then she asked him, ""o moslem! the slaying of nazarenes is lawful to you folk; what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself?""; and he answered, ""o my lady, thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful; for our prophet mohammed (whom allah bless and preserve!) prohibited the slaying of women and children, old men and monks!"" ""as it was thus revealed to your prophet,"" she replied, ""it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy; so rise. i give thee thy life, for generosity is never lost upon the generous."" then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib, even women; and she said to him, ""be not ashamed; but verily one who entereth the land of roum in quest of booty, and cometh to assist kings against kings, how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib?"" ""'twas not for lack of strength in me,"" he answered; ""nor didst thou throw me by thy force; it was thy loveliness overthrew me; so if thou wilt grant me another bout, it will be of thy courtesy."" she laughed and said, ""i grant thee thy request: but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary, and it were only right i should loose them, for haply this next wrestling bout will be long."" then she went to the slave girls and, unbinding them, said to them in the tongue of greece, ""get ye to some safe place, till i foil this moslem's lust and longing for you."" so they went away, whilst sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two. then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers, but when he felt waist touch waist, his strength failed him; and she, waxing ware of this, lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven-flash, and threw him to the ground. he fell on his back,  and then she said to him, ""rise: i give thee thy life a second time. i spared thee in the first count because of thy prophet, for that he made unlawful the slaying of women; and i do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood; but i charge thee, if there be in the moslem army sent by omar bin al-nu'uman to succour the king of constantinople, a stronger than thou, send him hither and tell him of me: for in wrestling there are shifts and trips, catches and holds, such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip, the hug, the feet-catch, the thigh lite,  the jostle and the leg-lock."" ""by allah, o my lady,"" quoth sharrkan (and indeed he was highly incensed against her), ""had i been master al-safdí, master mohammed kimál or ibn al-saddí,  as they were in their prime, i had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest; for o my mistress, by allah, thou hast not grassed me by thy strength, but by the blandishments of thy back parts; for we men of mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight. but now, an thou wish, thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me, and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three: moreover i have regained my presence of mind."" when she heard his words she said to him, ""hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling, o vanquished one? however come on, an thou wilt; but know that this must be the last round."" then she bent forward and challenged him and sharrkan did likewise, setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw: so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him, ""o moslem, thou art now on thy mettle."" ""yes,"" he replied, ""thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round, after which each of us will wend a different way."" she laughed and he laughed too;  then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares, which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back. she laughed at him and said, ""art thou an eater of bran? thou are like a badawi's bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the father of winds  that droppeth before a puff of air. fie upon thee, o thou poor thing!"" adding, ""get thee back to the moslem army and send us other than thyself, for thou fairest of thews; and proclaim for us, among the arabs and persians, the turks and daylamites,  whoso hath might in him, let him come to us."" then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to sharrkan, laughing, ""parting with thee is right grievous to me, o my lord; but get thee to thy mates before dawn, lest the knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points. thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman, so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and knights?"" sharrkan was confounded and called to her (as she turned from him making towards the convent), ""o my lady, wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger, the broken hearted slave of love?"" so she turned to him laughing and said, ""what is thy want? i will grant thee thy prayer."" ""have i set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy,"" replied he, ""and shall i return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality; i who have become one of thy servitors!"" ""none baulk kindliness save the base,"" she rejoined, ""honour us in allah's name, on my head and eyes be it! mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me, for now thou art my guest."" at this sharrkan was glad and, hastening back to his horse, mounted and walked him abreast of her, and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridge  built of beams of the white poplar, hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks. when sharrkan looked, he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts; and, as she came up to them, she said to one in the greek tongue, ""arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent."" so she went up to sharrkan and led him over, much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw, and saying to himself, ""o would that the wazir dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours."" then he turned to the young lady and said to her, ""o marvel of loveliness, now i have two claims upon thee; first the claim of good fellowship, and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality. i am now under thy commandance and thy guidance; so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of al-islam; where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who i am."" when she heard this she was angered and said to him, ""by the truth of the messiah, thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit; but now i see what mischief there is in thy heart, and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent. how should i do as thou sayest, when i wot that if i came to that king of yours, omar bin al- nu'uman, i should never get free from him? for truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls, lord of baghdad and of khorasan though he be, who hath built for himself twelve pavilions, in number as the months of the year, and in each a concubine after the number of the days; and if i come to him he would not prove shy of me, for your folk believe i am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ, 'or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves.'  so how canst thou speak thus to me? as for thy saying, 'thou shalt look upon the braves of the moslems,' by the truth of the messiah, thou sayest that which is not true, for i saw your army when it reached our land, these two days ago; and i did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of kings, but i beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together. and as to thy words, 'thou shalt know who i am,' i did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself; and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me, even wert thou sharrkan, omar bin al- nu'uman's son, the prowess name in these days!"" ""knowest thou sharrkan?"" asked he; and she answered yes! and i know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen; also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the king of constantinople."" ""o my lady,"" said sharrkan, ""i adjure thee by thy religion, tell me the cause of all this, that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth, and with whom the fault lies."" ""now by the virtue of thy faith,"" she replied, ""did i not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that i am of the daughters of roum, i would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader, the wazir dandan and vanquish their champion sharrkan.  nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby, for i have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the arabs. but i have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee, more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling; and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women. nor, indeed, had sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him, 'clear this stream,' could he have done it; and i only long and lust that the messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent, that i might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes.""- -and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the forty-eighth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the nazarene damsel said to sharrkan (and he listening impatiently enow), ""verily if sharrkan fell into my hands, i would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes,"" pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load; but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeating,  ""an faulty of one fault the beauty prove, * her charms a thousand advocates shall move.""  so she went up and sharrkan after her; and, when he saw the maiden's back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other, like rollers in the rolling sea, he extemporised these couplets:- -  ""for her sins is a pleader that brow, * and all hearts its fair              pleading must bow: when i saw it i cried, ""to night * the moon at its fullest doth             show; tho' balkis' own ifrit  try a bout, * spite his force she             would deal him a throw.""  the two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway. this she opened and ushered sharrkan into a long vestibule, vaulted with ten connected arches, from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire. the handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume, and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gems,  and went on before her (sharrkan still following), till they reached the inner convent. there the moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around, one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold. the monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work, and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold, whence the water ran like molten silver; whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for kings. then said the damsel, ""ascend, o my lord, this throne."" so he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time. sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him, ""she hath gone to her dormitory; but we will serve thee even as she ordered."" so they set before him viands of rare varieties, and he ate his sufficiency, when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver, and he washed his hands. then his thoughts reverted to his army, knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his father's injunctions: so he was troubled about his case, repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared; when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeated,  ""i am not lost to prudence, but indeed * here i'm bewildered,             what shall be my rede? would any aid me in mine ails of love, * by my own might and             sleight would i be free'd: but ah! my heart is lost and passion-shent: * to none save allah           can i trust my need!"" when he ended his verse behold, there came up to him a rare show and a fair, more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady, who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her. she was clad in brocades befitting kings; her breasts were like twin pomegranates, a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips; and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystal  supporting a silvern shaft. when sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight; and he forgot army and wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems. handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train, as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead. he sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness, and cried aloud, ""beware and beware of that zone rarely fair!"" and broke out into these couplets,  ""with heavy back parts, high breasts delicate, * and lissome form            that sways with swimming gait she deftly hides love longing in her breast; * but i may never            hide its ban and bate while hosts of followers her steps precede,  * like pearls             now necklaced and now separate.""  she gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him, when she came up to him and said, ""in very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee, o sharrkan! how sped thy night, o hero, after we went away and left thee?""; adding, ""verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful, especially in great kings! and thou art crown prince sharrkan, son and heir of king omar bin al-nu'uman; so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition, nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth; for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite. and as thou art pierced by the shaft of fate, be resignation thine and abide content to wait."" when he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth, saying, ""i am sharrkan, bin omar bin al-nu'uman, whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place; so whatso thou willest, do it in my case!"" she hung her head groundwards a long while, then turned to him and said, ""be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clear;  for thou art the guest of my hospitality, and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee; wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard. have no fear for, by the truth of the messiah, if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee, till life had left my body for thy sake: indeed thou art now under the charge of the messiah and of me."" hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him, till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him, she would have done so during the past night. presently she bespoke in the grecian tongue one of her slave girls, who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food; but sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself, ""haply she hath put somewhat in this meat."" she knew what was in his thought; so she turned to him and said, ""by the truth of the messiah, the case is not on such wise, nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest! had my mind been set on slaying thee, i had slain thee ere now."" then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful; where upon sharrkan came forward and ate too. she was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied. they washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour, wines of all colours and kinds and a wine-service with vessels of gold, silver and crystal. she filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him, even as she had done with the food: then she crowned a second and handed it to him. he drank and she said to him, ""o moslem, see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life!"" and she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink, till he took leave of his wits,- -and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the forty-ninth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits, for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her. presently she said to the slave girl, ""o marjanah ! bring us some instruments of music!"" ""to hear is to obey,"" said the hand maid and going out, returned in the twinkling of an eye with a damascus lute,  a persian harp, a tartar pipe, and an egyptian dulcimer. the young lady took the lute and, after tuning each several string, began in gentle undersong to sing, softer than zephyr's wing and sweeter than tasmin  spring, with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets following,  ""allah assain those eyne! what streams of blood they shed! * how            many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped. i love all lovers who to lovers show them cure; * 'twere wrong to            rue the love in wrong head born and bred: haply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens! * heaven help           the hapless heart by force of thee misled! thou doomest me to death who art my king, and i * ransom with           life the deemster who would doom me dead.""  thereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument, played and recited couplets in the roumi tongue; then their mistress sang also and seeing sharrkan in ecstasies asked him, ""o moslem, dost thou understand what i say?""; and he answered, ""nay, my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips."" she laughed and continued, ""if i sing to thee in arabic what wouldst thou do?"" ""i should no longer,"" quoth he, ""be master of my senses."" then she took an instrument and, changing the measure, began singing these verses,  ""the smack of parting's myrrh to me, * how, then, bear patience'             aloë? i'm girt by ills in trinity * severance, distance,              cruelty! my freedom stole that fairest she, * and parting irks me             bitterly.""  when she ended her verse, she looked at sharrkan and found him lost to existence, and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidens.  then he revived and, remembering the songs, again inclined to mirth and merriment; and the twain returned to their wine and wassail, and continued their playing and toying, their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing. then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when sharrkan asked after her they answered, ""she is gone to her sleeping chamber,"" whereto he rejoined, ""under allah's ward and his good guard!"" as soon as it was morning, a handmaid came to him and said to him, ""my mistress biddeth thee to her."" so he rose and followed her and, as he drew near her lodging, the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting, and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels. thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall, at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks, and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams. about the saloon were figures carved in human form, and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within, so that the beholder would fancy they spoke.  here sat the young lady, looking at the figures; but when she saw sharrkan, she sprang to her feet and, taking him by the hand, made him sit down by her side, and asked him how he had passed the night. he blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him, ""knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love?""; and he answered ""yes! i wot somewhat in verse on that matter."" ""let me hear it,"" quoth she, so he began quoting,  ""pleasure and health, good cheer, good appetite * to azzah,            freest with our name and fame! by allah! would i near her off she flies * at tangent, granting            less the more i claim: i dote on azzah, but when clear i off * my rivals, clears me too            that dearest dame; like wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud * which, ere             siesta done, thin air became.""  when she heard this she said, ""verily al-kuthayyir  was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste, and he was superlative in his praise of azzah when he sang"" (and she began to recite),  ""did azzah deal behest to sun o' noon, * the judge had judged her              beauty's bestest boon; and girls who come to me and carp at her, * god make their rosy            cheeks her sandal-shoon!  and indeed,"" quoth she, ""'twas said that azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness."" then she asked sharrkan saying, ""o prince, cost thou know aught of jamil's  verses to buthaynah? if so repeat to us somewhat of them;"" and he answered, ""yes, i know them better than any;"" whereupon he began repeating these couplets,  ""jamil, in holy war go fight!"" to me they say: * what war save             fight for fair ones would i e'er essay? to me their every word and work are mere delight, * and martyrs            crepe i all they slay in fight and fray: an ask i, 'o buthaynah! what's this love, i pray, * which eats             my heart?' quoth she ' 'twill stay for ever and aye!' and when i cry, 'of wits return some small display * for daily             use,' quoth she, 'far, far 'tis fled away! thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy * while i              no goal espy save thee and thee alway.'""  ""thou hast spoken right well,"" said she, ""o king's son, and jamil also spoke excellently well. but what would buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich,  'thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy?'""  ""o my lady,"" quoth sharrkan, ""she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me, and even that will not satisfy thee."" she laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till day put out her light and night came in darkness dight. then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept, while sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned. as soon as he awoke, the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment, as wont; and, kissing the ground between his hands, said to him, ""bismillah! in allah's name be so kind as to come : our mistress biddeth thee to her presence!"" so he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him, playing on tabrets and other instruments of music, till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall, decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts, passing all description. sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began reciting,  ""he plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry, * and her breast-            pearls that bedded in gold mine lie. pure water on silvern bars is her brow, * and her cheeks show              roses with rubies vie: meseems in her eyne that the violet's hue * lies purpling set in             the ithmid's  dye."" when the lady saw sharrkan, she stood up to him in honour and, taking his hand, seated him by her side and asked, ""o son of king omar bin al-nu'uman, hast thou any cunning in the game of chess?"" ""yes,"" he answered, ""but do not thou with me as said the poet, 'i speak and longing love upties me and unties me; * till with              her honey dew of inner lip she plies me: i brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me * with             white and black,  but black cum white ne'er satisfies              me: 'twas as if king for castle i were fain to place me * till wilful              loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me: and if i seek to read intent in eyes that eye me * oh man! that              glance askance with hint of wish defies me.'""  then she brought the chessboard and played with him; but sharrkan, instead of looking at her moves, kept gazing at her fair mouth, and putting knight in place of elephant and elephant  instead of knight. she laughed and said to him, ""if thy play be after this fashion, thou knowest naught of the game."" ""this is only our first,"" replied he, ""judge not by this bout."" when she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her; but she beat him a second time, a third, a fourth and a fifth. so she turned to him and said, ""thou art beaten in everything;"" and he replied, ""o my lady, how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten?"" then she bade bring food, and they ate and washed their hands; after which the wine was set before them and they drank. presently, she took the dulcimer, for her hand was cunning in smiting it, and she began repeating to an accompaniment these couplets,  ""twixt the close tied and open wide no medium fortune knoweth, *             now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness              showeth. then drink her wine the syne she's thine and smiling thou dost              find her * anon she'll fall and fare away when all thy good              forth goeth.""  they ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first. when darkness set in, the lady betook her to her dormitory, leaving him alone with the hand maids; so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn, when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom. seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up; and they carried him to their mistress, who came to meet him and, taking him by the hand, seated him by her side. then she asked him how he had passed his night, whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged; and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvised,  ""ne'er incline thee to part * which embitters the heart e'en the sun when he sets * shall in pallor depart.""  while they were solacing themselves after this fashion, behold, there arose a great and sudden clamour, and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in, holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands, and cried aloud in the grecian tongue ""thou hast fallen into our hands, o sharrkan, so make thee sure of death!"" when he heard this, he said to himself, ""by allah, she hath entrapped me and held me in play, till her men should come. these are the knights with whom she threatened me; but 'tis i who have thrown myself into this strait."" then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her, but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale; and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd, ""who are ye?"" ""o most gracious princess and peerless onion pearl,"" answered the leading knight, ""dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side?"" ""not i,"" she replied, ""who may he be?"" quoth the patrician, ""this is of towns the highwayman! this is he who rideth in the horseman's van! this is sharrkan, son of king omar bin al-nu'uman! this is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place! the news of him reached king hardub, thy father, by report of the ancient dame zat al- dawahi; and thy sire, our sovereign, hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the greeks by taking captive this ominous lion."" when she heard this, she looked at the knight and asked him, ""what be thy name?"" and he answered, ""i am másúrah, son of thy slave mausúrah bin káshardah, knight of knights."" ""and how?"" quoth she, ""durst thou enter my presence without leave?"" quoth he, ""o my lady, when i came to the gate, none forbade me, neither chamberlain nor porter, but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont; although, when others come, they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them. but this is not a time for long talking, when the king is expecting our return with this prince, the scorpion sting  of the islamitic host, that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came, without the bane of battling with them."" ""these words be ill words,"" rejoined the princess, ""and dame zat al-dawahi lied, avouching an idle thing and a vain, whereof she weeteth not the truth; for by the virtue of the messiah, this man who is with me is not sharrkan, nor is he a captive, but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality, and i made him my guest. so even were we assured that this be sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt, i say it would ill befit mine honour that i should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection. so make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men; but return to the king, my father, and kiss the ground before him, and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the lady zat al-dawahi."" ""o abrízah,"" replied masurah, the knight, ""i cannot return to the king's majesty without his debtor and enemy."" quoth she (and indeed she had waxed very wroth). ""out on thee! return to him with my answer, and no blame shall befal thee!"" quoth masurah, ""i will not return without him."" thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed, ""exceed not in talk and vain words; for verily this man had not come in to us, were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders; and if i said to him, 'thou art sharrkan, son of king omar bin al-nu'uman,' he would answer, 'yes.' but 'tis not of your competence to let or hinder him; for if you do so, he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place. behold, here he is by my side, and i will bring him before you sword and targe in hand."" ""albeit i were safe from thy wrath,"" answered masurah the knight, ""i am not safe from that of thy father, and when i see him, i shall sign to the knights to take him captive, and we will carry him to the king bound and in abject sort."" when she heard this, she said, ""the matter shall not pass thus, for 'twould be blazoning mere folly. this man is but one and ye are an hundred knights: so if you would attack him come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the king which is the valiant amongst you.""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the fiftieth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that princess abrizah said to the knight, ""this man is but one, and ye are an hundred: so if ye would attack him, come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the king which is the valiant."" quoth masurah, the knight, ""by the truth of the messiah, thou sayest sooth, and none but i shall sally out against him first."" quoth she, ""wait till i go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make. if he consent, 'tis well; but if he refuse, ye shall on no wise come to him, for i and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom."" so she went to sharrkan and told him the news, whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the emirs; but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad, till the report reached the king, against her wish and intent. so he again began reproaching himself and said, ""how came i to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the greeks?"" but hearing the young lady's proposal he said to her, ""indeed their onset, one after one, would be overburdensome to them. will they not come out against me, ten by ten?"" ""that would be villainy,"" said she; ""let one have at one."" when he heard this, he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear; and masurah, the knight, also sprang up and bore down upon him. sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cut  which clove him to the middle, and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels. when the lady beheld that swashingblow, sharrkan's might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness. so she turned to the knights and said, ""take wreak for your chief!"" thereupon out came the slain man's brother, a fierce and furious knight, and rushed upon sharrkan, who delayed not, but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals. then cried the princess, ""o ye servants of the messiah, avenge your comrade!"" so they ceased not charging down upon him, one after one; and sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade, till he had slain fifty knights, the lady looking on the while. and allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors, so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello, but fell upon him in a body; and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock, and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sled,  till he had driven sense and soul out of them. then the princess called aloud to her damsels, saying, ""who is left in the convent?""; and they replied, ""none but the gate keepers;"" whereupon she went up to sharrkan and took him to her bosom, he doing the same, and they returned to the palace, after he had made an end of the melee. now there remained a few of the knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery, and when the princess saw this she rose from sharrkan's side and left him for a while, but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine indian scymitar. and she said, ""now by the truth of the messiah, i will not be a niggard of myself for my guest; nor will i abandon him though for this i abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the greeks."" then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the knights, and other twenty had taken to flight.  when she saw what work he had made with them she said to him, ""allah bless thee, o sharrkan! the cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee."" then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these couplets,  ""how oft in the mellay i've cleft the array, * and given their              bravest to lions a prey: ask of me and of them when i proved me prow * o'er creation, on              days of the foray and fray: when i left in the onslaught their lions to lie * on the sands of              the low lands  in fieriest day.""  when he ended his verse, the princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand; then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her, ""o lady mine, wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand?"" ""to guard thee against these caitiffs,""  she replied. then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them, ""how came ye to admit the king's knights into my dwelling without leave of me?""; and they answered, ""o princess, it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the king's messengers, and especially for the chief of his knights."" quoth she, ""i think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest;"" and bade sharrkan smite their necks. he did so and she cried to the rest of her servants, ""of a truth, they deserved even more than that!"" then turning to sharrkan, she said to him, ""now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed, thou shalt be made acquainted with my history. know, then, that i am the daughter of king hardub of roum; my name is abrizah and the ancient dame, yclept zat al-dawahi, is my grandmother by the sword side. she it certainly is who told my father of thee, and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me, more by token as thou hast slain my father's chivalry and it is noised abroad that i have separated myself from the nazarenes and have become no better than i should be with the moslems. wherefore it were wiser that i leave this dwelling while zat al-dawahi is on my track; but i require of thee the like kindness and courtesy i have shown thee, for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account. so do not thou neglect to do aught that i shall say to thee, remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee."" hearing her words, sharrkan joyed greatly; his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight, and he said, ""by allah, none shall come at thee, while life is in my bosom! but hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people?"" ""even so,"" she answered; and sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth. then said she, ""now is my heart at ease; but there remaineth one other condition for thee."" ""what is it?"" asked he and she answered, ""it is that thou return with thy host to thine own country."" quoth he, ""o lady mine, my father, king omar bin al- nu'uman, sent me to wage war upon thy sire, on account of the treasure he plundered from the king of constantinople, and amongst the rest three great jewels, noted givers of good fortune."" quoth she, ""cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes: i will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the king of constantinople. know that we have a yearly festival, highs the convent feast, whereat kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate; thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families, and the visitors abide there seven days. i was wont to be one of them; but, when there befel enmity between us, my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years. one year, it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron, as was their custom, came a daughter of the king of constantinople, a beautiful girl called sophia. they tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their ways;  but sophia said, 'i will not return to constantinople save by water.' so they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite; and making sail they put out to sea; but as they were voyaging behold, a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till, as fate and fortune would have it, she fell in with a nazarene craft from the camphor island  carrying a crew of five hundred armed franks, who had been cruising about a long time. when they sighted the sails of the ship, wherein sophia and her women were, they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her, then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her. then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and, splitting their sails, drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast. thereupon we sallied forth and, looking on them as spoil driven to us by fate,  boarded and took them; and, slaying the men, made prize of the wreck, wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens, amongst whom was the king's daughter, sophia. after the capture we carried the princess and her women to my father, not knowing her to be a daughter of king afridun of constantinople; and he chose out for himself ten including her; and divided the rest among his dependents. presently he set apart five damsels, amongst whom was the king s daughter, and sent them to thy father, king omar bin al-nu'uman, together with other gifts, such as broadcloth  and woollen stuffs and grecian silks. thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls sophia, daughter of king afridun; nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year, when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat, rebuking him with menaces and saying to him: two years ago, you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of frankish pirates in which was my daughter, sophia, attended by her maidens numbering some threescore. yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise; nor could i make the matter public, lest reproach befal me amongst the kings, by reason of my daughter's honour. so i concealed my case till this year, when i wrote to certain frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the kings of the isles. they replied, 'by allah we carried her not forth of thy realm; but we have heard that king hardub rescued her from certain pirates. and they told me the whole tale.' then he added in the writing which he writ to my father: 'except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter, you will, the instant my letter reacheth you, send my daughter back to me. but if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment, i will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practices.'  when my father read this letter and understood the contents,  it vexed him and he regretted not having known that sophia, king afridun's daughter, was among the captured damsels, that he might have sent her back to her sire; and he was perplexed about the case because, after so long a time, he could not send to king omar bin al-nu'uman and demand her back from him, especially as he had lately heard that heaven had granted him boon of babe by this sophia. so when we pondered that truth, we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity; and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to king afridun, making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to king omar bin al nu'uman, who had gotten the blessing of issue by her. when my father's reply reached king afridun he rose up and sat down,  and roared and foamed at the mouth crying:—'what! shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to kings, and they lie with her without marriage contract? by the messiah and the true faith,' said he, 'i will not desist till i have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame; and indeed i will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me!' so he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares, when he sent an embassy to thy father, king omar, to tell him that which thou hast heard: accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to king afridun, whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot. as for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid, there was not one soothfast word in that matter, for they were with sophia, his daughter; and my father took them from her, when he got possession of her and of her maidens, and gave them to me in free gift, and they are now with me. so go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into, and shut in by, the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the franks and the country of the greeks; for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior, they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the day of retribution and retaliation. i know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them, because thou didst order a three days' rest; withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do."" when sharrkan heard her words, he was absent awhile in thought; then he kissed princess abrizah's hand and said, ""praise be to allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me! but 'tis grievous to me to part from thee and i know not what will become of thee after my departure."" ""go now to thine army,"" she replied, ""and turn them back, while ye are yet near your own country. if the envoys be still with them, lay hands on them and keep them, that the case may be made manifest to you; and, after three days, i will be with you all and we will enter baghdad together."" as he turned to depart she said, ""forget not the compact which is between me and thee,"" then she rose to bid  him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire, so she took leave of him and, throwing her arms round his neck, wept with exceeding weeping, and repeated these verses,  ""i bade adieu, my right hand wiped my tears away, * the while my              left hand held her in a close embrace: 'fearest thou naught,' quoth she, 'of shame?' i answered 'nay, *              the lover's parting day is lover's worst disgrace.'""  then sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent. they brought his steed, so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow. as soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert, and he bared his brand and rode cautiously, but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold, it was the wazir dandan and two of his emirs. when they saw him and knew him, they dismounted and saluting him, asked the reason of his absence; whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and princess abrizah from first to last. the wazir returned thanks to almighty allah for his safety and said,  ""let us at once leave these lands; for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the king of our approach, and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners."" so sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount, which they did and, setting out at once, they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay. the ambassadors meanwhile had reported sharrkan's approach to their king, who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him. but sharrkan, escorted by the wazir dandan and the two emirs, had no sooner sighted the army, than he raised the cry ""march! march!"" they took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day, nor did they cease faring for five days; at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley, where they rested awhile. then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country. here, deeming themselves safe, they halted to rest; and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts. they tarried there two days after which, as all would be making for their homes, sharrkan put the wazir dandan in command, bidding him lead the host back to baghdad. but he himself remained behind with an hundred riders, till the rest of the army had made one day's march: then he called ""to horse!"" and mounted with his hundred men. they rode on two parasangs'  space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo! there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust. so they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted, discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers, lion faced and in mail coats cased. as soon as they drew within earshot of sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them, saying, ""by the virtue of john and mary, we have won to our wish! we have been following you by forced marches, night and day, till we forewent you to this place. so dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves, that we may grant you your lives."" when sharrkan heard this, his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said 'how is it, o. nazarene dogs, ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land? and doth not this suffice you, but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech? do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country?"" then he shouted to his hundred horsemen, ""up and at these hounds, for they even you in number!"" so saying, he bared his sabre and bore down on them, he and his, but the franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks, and wight dashed against wight, and knight dashed upon knight, and hot waxed the fight, and sore was the affright, and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight; and they stinted not to charge and to smite, right hand meeting right, nor to hack and hew with blades bright white, till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight. then they drew apart and sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only, who showed hurts but not death hurts. said he to them, ""by allah, my life long have i waded in the clashing sea of fight and i have met many a gallant sprite, but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant knights!"" ""know, o king,"" said they, that there is among them a frankish cavalier who is their leader and, indeed, he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust: but, by allah, he spares us great and small; for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him. by allah, had he willed he had killed us all."" sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the knight had done and such high report of him, so he said, ""when the morn shall morrow, we will draw out and defy them, for we are an hundred to their hundred; and we will seek aid against them from the lord of the heavens."" so they rested that night in such intent; whilst the franks gathered round their captain and said, ""verily this day we did not win our will of these;"" and he replied, ""at early dawn when the morrow shall morn, we will draw out and challenge them, one after one."" they also rested in that mind, and both camps kept guard until almighty allah sent the light of day dawn. thereupon king sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain, where they found the franks ranged in line of battle; and sharrkan said to his followers, ""our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir; so up and at them and lay on load."" then came forth an herald of the franks and cried out, saying, ""let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day, save by the duello, a champion of yours against a champion of ours."" whereupon one of sharrkan's riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying, ""ho! who is for smiting? let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling!"" hardly had he made an end of his vaunt, when there sallied forth to him a frankish cavalier, armed cap-à-pie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff, riding on a grey white steed,  and he had no hair on his cheeks. he urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust, but it was not long before the frank foined the moslem with the lance point; and, toppling him from his steed, took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen. his folk rejoiced in their comrade and, forbidding him to go out again to the field, sent forth another, to whom sallied out another moslem, brother to the captive, and offered him battle. the two fell to, either against other, and fought for a little while, till the frank bore down upon the moslem and, falsing him with a feint, tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner. after this fashion the moslems ceased not dashing forwards, one after one, and the franks to unhorse them and take them captive, till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted. now they had captured of the moslems twenty cavaliers, and when sharrken saw this, it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them, ""what is this thing that hath befallen us? to- morrow, i myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band. if he persist, we will punish him with death, and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him."" they righted on this wise till allah almighty caused the morn to dawn, when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain; and sharrkan was going forth to the plain, but behold, more than one half of the franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted, till they reached the midst of the battle plain. sharrken looked at that horseman and lo! he was their chief. he was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt; his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks. he hent in hand an indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow, like a dirham; and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when, signing to the moslems, he cried out in fluent arab speech ""ho, sharrkan! ho, son of omar bin al- nu'uman! ho, thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries! up and out to battle bout, and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field! thou art prince of thy people and i am prince of mine; and whoso overcometh his adversary, him let the other's men obey and come under his sway."" hardly had he ended his speech, when out came sharrkan with a heart full of fury, and urging his steed into the midst of the field, closed like a raging lion with the frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors. then they fell to foining and hewing, and they stinted not of onset and offset, and give and take, as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing; nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened. then they drew apart and each returned to his own party; but as soon as sharrkan foregathered with his comrades, he said, ""never looked i on the like of this cavalier: he hath one quality i have not yet seen in any and this it is that, when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow, he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lance-heel! in very deed i know not what will be the issue 'twixt him and me; but 'tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men."" then he went to his rest for the night and, when morning dawned, the frank came forth and rode down to the mid field, where sharrkan met him; and they fell to fighting and to wheeling, left and right; and necks were stretched out to see the sight, nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might, till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light. then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp, where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello; and at last the frank said to his men, ""tomorrow shall decide the matter!"" so they both passed that night restfully till dawn; and, as soon as it was day, they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done. then the frank bethought him of a ruse; first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein, so that he stumbled and fell with his rider; thereupon sharrkan threw himself on the foe, and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged, when the frank cried out to him, ""o sharrkan, champions are not wont to do thus! this is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a woman.""  when sharrkan heard this, he raised his eyes to the frank's face and gazing steadfastly at him, recognized in him princess abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent; whereupon he cast brand from hand and, kissing the earth before her, asked her, ""what moved thee to a deed like this?""; and she answered, ""i desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting. these that are with me are my handmaids, and they are all clean maids; yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain; and had not my steed stumbled with me, thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat."" sharrkan smiled at her speech and said, ""praise be to allah for safety and for my reunion with thee, o queen of the age!"" then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of sharrkan's troop and dismount. they did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and sharrkan who said to them, ""it is the like of you that kings keep in store for the need hour."" then he signed to his comrades to salute the princess; so all alighted and kissed the earth before her, for they knew the story. after this, the whole two hundred took horse, and fared on night and day for six days' space, till they drew near to baghdad, when they halted and sharrkan bade abrizah and her handmaids doff the frankish garb that was on them,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the fifty-first night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that sharrkan bade princess abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of greece; and thus did they. then he despatched a company of his companions to baghdad to acquaint his father omar bin al-nu'uman, with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by princess abrizah, daughter of king hardub, lord of graecia-land. they halted forthright in the place they had reached, and sharrkan also halted and all righted there; and when almighty allah made morning dawn, sharrkan and his company and abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city; when lo! on the way they met the wazir dandan, who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour abrizah and sharrkan, by especial commandment of king omar son of al- nu'uman. when the two drew near, they turned towards them and kissed ground before them; then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace. sharrkan walked in to his father, who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case. so he told him all that abrizah had told him, and what had passed between them and said, ""she hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us; and indeed,"" he said to his father, ""the king of constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief, because of his daughter sophia, for that the king of greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee; and he (the grecian king) not knowing her to be daughter of king afridun, lord of constantinople; and, had he known that, he would not have bestowed her upon thee, but he would have restored her to her parent. and of a verity,"" he continued, ""we were saved from these perils only by the lady abrizah, and never saw we a more valiant than she."" and he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting. when king omar heard the story of sharrkan, abrizah was exalted in his eyes, and he longed to see her and question her. thereupon sharrkan went out to her and said, ""the king calleth for thee;"" she replied, ""i hear and i obey;"" and he took her and brought her in to his father, who was seated on his throne and who, having dismissed his high officers, was attended only by his eunuchs. the princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands, saluted him in choice terms. he was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son sharrkan and bade her be seated. so she sat down and unveiled her face;  and, when the king saw her beauty, his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour, appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels, and assigning them solde and allowances. then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid, and she answered, ""here be they with me, o king of the age!"" so saying, she rose and going to her lodging, unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold. she opened the casket and taking out those three jewels, kissed them and gave them to the king. then she went away bearing his heart with her. after her going the king sent for his son sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three, and when he enquired of the other two replied, ""o my son! i mean to give one to thy brother zau al-makan, and the other to thy sister nuzhat al- zaman."" but when sharrkan heard that he had a brother (for to that time he knew only of his sister) he turned to his sire and said to him, ""o king, hast thou a son other than myself?"" he answered, ""yes, and he is now six years old;"" adding that his name was zau al- makan and that he and nuzhat al-zaman were twins, born at a birth. this news was grievous to sharrkan, but he kept his secret and said, ""the bless- ing of allah most high be upon them!"", and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes. quoth the king, ""how do i see thee change thy manner when hearing of this, considering that after me thou becomes"" heir of the kingdom. of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the emirs and grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee; and this one of the three jewels is thine."" sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away, knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath, and stayed not walking till he had entered abrizah's palace. as he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire. then she sat down and seated him by her side; but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him, whereupon he told her that allah had blessed his father with two children by sophia, a boy and a girl, and that he had named the boy zau al-makan and the girl nuzhat al-zaman; adding, ""he hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine, so i left it behind; i knew naught of zau al-makan's birth till this day, and the twain are now six years old. so when i learnt this, wrath possessed me; and i tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee. but now i fear lest my father take thee to wife, for he loveth thee and i saw in him signs of desire for thee: so what wilt thou say, if he wish this?"" quoth she, ""know, o sharrkan, that thy father hath no dominion over me, nor can he have me without my consent; and if he prevail over me by force, i will take my own life. as for the three jewels, it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and i had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price; but now i desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee, if thou have accepted it."" ""hearkening and obedience,"" replied sharrkan, and gave it to her. then said she, ""fear nothing,"" and talked with him awhile and continued, ""i fear lest my father hear that i am with you and sit not patiently under my loss, but do his endeavours to find me; and to that end he may ally himself with king afridun, on account of his daughter sophia, and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil."" when sharrken heard these words, he said to her, ""o my lady, if it please thee to sojourn with us, take no thought of them; though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea."" "" 'tis well,"" rejoined she; ""if ye entreat me fair, i will tarry with you, and if ye deal evilly by me, i will depart from you."" then she bade her slave maidens bring food; so they set the tables, and sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house, disturbed and perturbed. such was his case; but regarding the affairs of his father, omar bin al-nu'uman, after dismissing his son sharrkan he arose and, taking the other two jewels, betook himself to the lady sophia, who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated. presently, his two children, zau al-makan and nuzhat al-zaman, came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each one's neck, at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands. then went they to their mother, who joyed in their joy and wished the king long life; so he asked her, ""why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of king afridun, lord of constantinople, that i might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank?"" ""o king,"" answered sophia, ""and what could i desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee, overwhelmed as i am with thy favours and thy benefits? and, furthermore, allah hath blessed me with two children by thee, a son and a daughter."" her reply pleased the king and after leaving her, he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace. moreover, he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service; and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment. and presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his court where he distributed justice among the lieges. so far concerning him and sophia and her children; but in the matter of abrizah the king was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day; and every night, he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her, but she gave him no answer, only saying, ""o king of the age! i have no desire for men at this present."" when he saw her withdraw from him, his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until, when weary of this, he summoned his wazir dandan and, opening his very heart to him, told him of his love for princess abrizah, daughter of hardub, and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die, for that he could get no grace of her. the wazir, hearing these words, said to the king, ""as soon as it is dark night, take thou a piece of bhang the measure of a miskal, about an ounce, and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her. when the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near, fill her a last cup and dropping therein the bhang, give it to her to drink, and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her. then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her; and such is my advice.""  ""thy rede is aright,"" quoth the king, and seeking his treasury, he took thence a piece of concentrated bhang, if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year. this he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by, when he betook himself to the palace of princess abrizah, who seeing him stood up to receive him; but he bade her sit down. so she sat down, and he sat by her, and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail, whereupon she furnished the carousing table  and placed it before him. then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking. so they fell to tippling and the king ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head; and seeing this he took out the bit of bhang from his pocket and, holding it between his fingers, filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off. then filling a second he said, ""to thy companionship!""; and dropped the drug into her cup, she knowing naught of it. she took it and drank it off; then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber. he waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses, when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back: and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs. when the king saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet, shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and satan seduced him and he could not master himself, but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head. then he rose off her and went to one of her women, by name marjánah, and said, ""go in to thy lady and speak with her."" so she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible, with the blood running down to the calves of her legs, whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night. as soon as almighty allah brought the dawn, the handmaid marjanah washed her mistress's hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it, where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of bhang like a bolus.  then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to marjanah, ""tell me what hath befallen me."" so she told her what had passed and how she had found her, lying on her back, with the blood running down, wherefore she knew that king omar bin al-nu'uman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her. at this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy, saying to her damsels, ""deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that i am ill, till i see what allah will do with me."" presently the news of her sickness came to the king; so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries. some months she thus passed in solitude, during which time the king's flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched, so that he abstained from her. now she had conceived by him, and when the months of child breeding had gone by, her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled, and the world was straitened upon her, so she said to her handmaid marjanah, ""know that it is not the folk who have wronged me, but i who sinned against my own self  in that i left my father and mother and country. indeed, i abhor life, for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me. i used, when i mounted my steed, to have the mastery of him, but now i am unable to ride. if i be brought to bed among them i shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame; and if i return to my father, with what face shall i meet him or with what face shall i have recourse to him? how well quoth the poet,  'say, what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead *              nor cup companion, nor a cup, nor place to house his head?'""  marjanah answered her, ""it is thine to command; i will obey;"" and abrizah said, ""i desire at once to leave this place secretly, so that none shall know of me but thou; and return to my father and my mother, for when flesh stinketh, there is naught for it but its own folk and allah shall do with me e'en as he will."" ""o princess,"" marjanah replied, ""what thou wouldest do is well."" then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the king went out to chase and hunt, and his son sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile. then said she to marjanah, ""i wish to set out this night, but how shall i do against my destiny? for already i feel the pangs of labour and child birth, and if i abide other four or five days, i shall be brought to bed here, and i shall be unable to travel to my country. but this is what was written on my forehead."" then she considered awhile, and said to marjanah, ""look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way, for i have no strength to bear arms."" ""by allah, o my lady,"" replied marjanah, ""i know none but a black slave called al- ghazbán,  who is one of the slaves of king omar bin al- nu'uman; he is a valiant wight, and he keepeth guard at our palace gate. the king appointed him to attend us, and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours; so, lookye, i will go out and speak with him of this matter, and promise him some monies and tell him that, if he have a mind to tarry with us, i will marry him to whom he will. he told me before to day that he had been a highwayman; so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land."" she rejoined, ""call him that i may talk with him;"" whereupon marjanah fared forth and said to the slave, 'o ghazban, allah prosper thee, so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee!"" then she took him by the hand and brought him to the princess, whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him, her heart took fright at him. ""how ever,"" she said to herself, ""of a truth, need giveth the law;"" and she approached to speak with him, yet her heart started away from him. presently she said, ""o ghazban, say me, wilt thou help me against the perfidies of fortune and conceal my secret if i discover it to thee?"" when the slave saw her, his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply; ""o my mistress, whatsoever thou biddest me do, i will not depart therefrom."" quoth she, ""i would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the king's horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt, and go with us to our own country; where, if thou desire to abide with us, i will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens, or, if thou prefer return to thine own land, we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires"" after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee."" when al ghazban, heard this, he rejoiced with great joy and replied, ""o my lady, i will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses."" then he went away gladsome and saying to himself, ""i shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me, i will kill them both and take their riches."" but he kept this his intent to himself, and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses, one of which he rode, and princess abrizah made marjanah mount the second she mounting the third, albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish. and the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains, till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country; when the travail pangs came upon abrizah and she could no longer resist; so she said to al-ghazban, ""set me down, for the pains of labour are upon me;"" and cried to marjanah, ""do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me."" then marjanah dismounted from her horse, and al-ghazban did in like sort, and they made fast the bridles and helped the princess to dismount, for she was aswoon from excess of anguish. when al-ghazban saw her on the ground, satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishing it in her face, said ""o my lady, vouchsafe me thy favours."" hearing these words she turned to him and said, ""it remaineth for me only that i yield me to negro slaves, after having refused kings and braves!""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the fifty-second night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that princess abrizah said to the black slave al ghazban, ""it remaineth for me only that i yield me to negro slaves, after having refused kings and braves!"" and she was wroth with him and cried, ""woe to thee! what words are these thou sayest? out on thee, and talk not thus in my presence and know that i will never consent to what thou sayest, though i drink the cup of death. wait till i have cast my burden and am delivered of the after birth, and then, if thou be able thereto, do with me as thou wilt; but, an thou leave not lewd talk at this time assuredly i will slay myself with my own hand and quit the world and be at peace from all this."" and she began reciting extempore,   ""o spare me, thou ghazban, indeed enow for me * are heavy strokes             of time, mischance and misery! whoredom my lord forfends to all humanity; * quoth he, 'who            breaks my bidding hell for home shall see!' and if thou leave not suing me to whoredom's way * against th'           almighty's choicest gift, my chastity, upon my tribesmen i with might and main will call * and gather           all, however far or near they be; and with yamáni blade were i in pieces hewn, * ne'er shall he            sight my face who makes for villeiny, the face of free born come of noble folk and brave; * what then             can be to me the seed of whoreson slave?""  when ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly; his eyes reddened with blood and his face became a dusty grey ; his nostrils swelled, his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of his aspect redoubled. and he repeated these couplets,  ""ho thou, abrizah, mercy! leave me not for i * of thy love and              yamáni  glance the victim lie my heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty, * my body wasted and my                    patience done to die: from glances ravishing all hearts with witchery * reason far            flies, the while desire to thee draws nigh; though at thy call should armies fill the face of earth * e'en            now i'd win my wish and worlds in arms defy!""  when abrizah heard these words, she wept with sore weeping and said to him, ""woe to thee, o ghazban! how dareth the like of thee to address me such demand, o base born and obscene bred? dost thou deem all folk are alike?"" when the vile slave heard this from her, he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder: and he came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neck wounded her to the death. then he drove her horse before him with the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains. such was the case with al-ghazban; but as regards abrizah, she gave birth to a son, like the moon, and marjanah took the babe and did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mother's side; and lo and behold! the child fastened to its mother's breast and she dying.  when marjanah saw this, she cried out with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on her head and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed, saying, ""alas, my mistress! alas, the pity of it! thou art dead by the hand of a worthless black slave, after all thy knightly prowess!"" and she ceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose and walled the horizon;  but, after awhile, it lifted and discovered a numerous conquering host. now this was the army of king hardub, princess abrizah's father, and the cause of his coming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaids having fled to baghdad, and that they were with king omar bin al- nu'uman, he had come forth, leading those with him, to seek tidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with the king. when he had gone a single day's march from his capital, he espied three horse men afar off and made towards them, intending to ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter. now these three whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and marjanah and the slave al- ghazban; and he made for them to push inquiry. seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself; so he killed abrizah and fled for his life. when they came up, king hardub saw his daughter lying dead and marjanah weeping over her, and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to the ground. all the riders of his company, the emirs and waxirs, took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain and set up for the king a great pavilion, domed and circular, without which stood the grandees of the realm. when marjanah saw her master, she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled; and, when he came to himself, he questioned her and she told him all that had passed and said, ""of a truth he that hath slain thy daughter is a black slave belonging to king omar bin al-nu'uman, and she informed him how sharrkan's father had dealt with the princess. when king hardub heard this, the world grew black in his sight and he wept with sore weeping. then he called for a litter and, therein laying his dead daughter, returned to caesarea and carried her into the palace, where he went in to his mother, zat al-dawahi, and said to that lady of calamities, ""shall the moslems deal thus with my girl? verily king omar bin al-nu'uman despoiled her of her honour by force, and after this, one of his black slaves slew her. by the truth of the messiah, i will assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear away from mine honour the stain of shame; else will i kill myself with mine own hand!"" and he wept passing sore. quoth his mother, ""none other than marjanah killed thy daughter, for she hated her in secret;"" and she continued to her son, ""fret not for taking the blood wit of thy daughter, for, by the truth of the messiah, i will not turn back from king omar bin al-nu'uman till i have slain him and his sons; and of a very truth i will do with him a deed, passing the power of sage and knight, whereof the chroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in every place: but needs must thou do my bidding in all i shall direct, for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surely compass his desire."" ""by the virtue of the messiah,"" replied he, ""i will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say."" then quoth she, ""bring me a number of hand maids, high bosomed virgins, and summon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophy and the rules of behaviour before kings, and the art of conversation and making verses; and let them talk with them of all manner science and edifying knowledge. and the sages must be moslems, that they may teach them the language and traditions of the arabs, together with the history of the caliphs and the ancient annals of the kings of al-islam; and if we persevere in this for four years' space, we shall gain our case. so possess thy soul in patience and wait; for one of the arabs saith, 'if we take man bote after years forty the time were short to ye.' when we have taught the girls these things, we shall be able to work our will with our foe, for he doteth on women and he hath three hundred and sixty concubines, whereto are now added an hundred of the flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter, she that hath found mercy.  as soon as i have made an end of their education, as described to thee, i will take them and set out with them in person."" when king hardub heard his mother's words, he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head; and at once despatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifold to fetch him moslem sages. they obeyed his commands and fared to far countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors he sought. when these came into presence, he honoured them with notable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed to them stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenas they should have taught the damsels. then he committed the handmaidens to their hands—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the fifty-third night.  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the sages and the doctors stood in presence of king hardub, he honoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidens to their hands, enjoining that these be instructed in all manner of knowledge, philosophy and polite accomplishments; and they set themselves to do his bidding. such was the case with king hardub; but as for king omar bin al nu'uman, when he returned from coursing and hunting and entered his palace, he sought princess abrizah but found her not, nor any one knew of her nor could any give him news of her. this was grievous to him and he said, ""how could the lady leave the palace unknown of any? had my kingdom been at stake in this case, it were in perilous condition there being none to govern it! i will never again go to sport and hunt till i have stationed at the gates those who shall keep good guard over them!"" and he was sore vexed and his breast was straitened for the loss of princess abrizah. hereupon behold, his son sharrkan returned from his journey; and the father told him what had happened, and informed him how the lady had fled, whilst he was chasing and hunting, whereat he grieved with exceeding grief. then king omar took to visiting his children every day and making much of them and brought them learned men and doctors to teach them, appointing for them stipends. when sharrkan saw this, he raged with exceeding rage and envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs of chagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish by reason of this matter: so one day his father said to him, ""why do i see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face?"" ""o my father,"" replied sharrkan, ""every time i see thee fondle my brother and sister and make much of them, jealousy seizeth on me, and i fear lest it grow on me till i slay them and thou slay me in return. and this is the reason of my weakness of body and change of complexion. but now i crave of thy favour that thou give me one of thy castles outlying the rest, that i may abide there the remnant of my life, for as the sayer of bywords saith, 'absence from my friend is better and fitter for me'; and, 'whatso eye doth not perceive, that garreth not heart to grieve.'"" and he bowed his head towards the ground. when king omar bin al-nu'uman heard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of his being broken down, he soothed his heart and said to him, ""o my son, i grant thee this and i have not in my reign a greater than the castle of damascus, and the government of it is thine from this time."" thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries of state and bade them write sharrkan's patent of investiture to the viceroyalty of damascus of syria. and when they had written it, he equipped him and sent with him the wazir dandan, and invested him with the rule and government and gave him instructions as to policy and regulations; and took leave of him, and the grandees and officers of state did likewise, and he set out with his host. when he arrived at damascus, the townspeople beat the drums and blew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet him in great state; whilst all the notables and grandees paced in procession, and those who stood to the right of the throne walked on his right flank, and the others to the left. thus far concerning sharrkan; but as regards his father, omar bin al- nu'uman, soon after the departure of his son, the children's tutors and governors presented themselves before him and said to him, ""o our lord, thy children have now learnt knowledge and they are completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquette of ceremony."" the king rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy and conferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men, seeing zau al- makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship. the prince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himself with piety and prayers, loving the poor, the olema and the koran students, so that all the people of baghdad loved him, men and women. one day, the procession of the mahmil  of irák passed round baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage to meccah and visitation of the tomb of the prophet (whom allah bless and preserve!). when zau al-makan the mahmil procession he was seized with longing desire to become a pilgrim,  so he went in to his sire and said, ""i come to ask thy leave to make the pilgrimage."" but his father forbade him saying, ""wait till next year and i will go and thou too."" when the prince saw that the matter was postponed, he betook himself to his sister nuzhat al-zaman, whom he found standing at prayer. as soon as she had ended her devotions he said to her, ""i am dying with desire of pilgrimage to the holy house of allah at meccah and to visit the tomb of the prophet, upon whom be peace! i asked my father's leave, but he forbade me that, so i mean to take privily somewhat of money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge."" ""allah upon thee,"" exclaimed she, ""take me with thee and deprive me not of visitation to the tomb of the prophet, whom allah bless and keep!"" and he answered, ""as soon as it is dark night, do thou come forth from this place, without telling any."" accordingly,when it was the middle of the night she arose and took somewhat of money and donned a man's habit; and she ceased not walking to the palace gate, where she found zau al-makan with camels ready for marching. so he mounted and mounted her; and the two fared on till they were in the midst of the iraki  pilgrim-party, and they ceased not marching and allah wrote safety for them, till they entered meccah the holy and stood upon arafát and performed the pilgrimage rites. then they made a visitation to the tomb of the prophet (whom allah bless and assain!) and thought to return with the pilgrims to their native land. but zau al-makan said to his sister, ""o my sister, it is in my mind to visit the holy house,  jerusalem, and abraham the friend of allah  (on whom be peace!)."" ""i also desire so to do,"" replied she. so they agreed upon this and he fared forth and took passage for himself and her and they made ready and set out in the ship with a company of jerusalem palmers. that very night the sister fell sick of an aguish chill, and was grievously ill but presently recovered, after which the brother also sickened. she tended him during his malady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived at jerusalem, but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker and weaker. they alighted at a khan and there hired a lodging; but zau al- makan's sickness ceased not to increase on him, till he was wasted with leanness and became delirious. at this, his sister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed, ""there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah, the glorious, the great! this is the decree of allah!"" they sojourned in that place awhile, his weakness ever increasing and she attending him and buying necessaries for him and for herself, till all the money she had was expended and she became so poor that she had not so much as a dirham left. then she sent a servant of the khan to the bazar with some of her clothes, and he sold them and she spent the price upon her brother; then sold she something more and she ceased not selling all she had, piece by piece, till nothing was left but an old rug. whereupon she wept and exclaimed, ""verily is allah the orderer of the past and the future!"" presently her brother said to her, ""o my sister, i feel recovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roast meat."" ""by allah! o my brother,"" replied she, ""i have no face to beg; but tomorrow i will enter some rich man's house and serve him and earn somewhat for our living."" then she bethought herself awhile and said, ""of a truth 'tis hard for me to leave thee and thou in this state, but i must despite myself!"" he rejoined, ""allah forbid! thou wilt be put to shame; but there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah!"" and he wept and she wept too. then she said, ""o my brother, we are strangers who have dwelt here a full year, but none hath yet knocked at our door. shall we then die of hunger? i know no resource but that i go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive, till thou recover from thy sickness, when we will travel back to our native land."" she sat weeping awhile and he wept too, propped upon his elbow. then nuzhat al-zaman arose and, veiling her head with a bit of camlet,  which had been of the cameleer's clothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them; she kissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forth from him, weeping and knowing not whither she should wend. and she stinted not going and her brother zau al-makan awaiting her return till the supper time; but she came not, and he watched for her till the morning morrowed but still she returned not; and this endured till two days went by. he was greatly troubled thereat and his heart fluttered for her, and hunger was sore upon him. at last he left the chamber and, calling the servant of the caravanserai, said, ""i wish thee to bear me to the bazar."" so he carried him to the market street and laid him down there; and the people of jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tears seeing his condition. he signed to them begging for somewhat to eat; so they brought him some money from certain of the merchants who were in the bazar, and bought food and fed him therewith; after which they carried him to a shop, where they spread him a mat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head. when night fell, all the folk went away, sore concerned for him and, in the middle of the night, he called to mind his sister and his sickness redoubled on him, so that he abstained from eating and drinking and became insensible to the world around him. then the bazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirty seven dirhams, and hiring a camel, said to the driver, ""carry this sick man to damascus and leave him in the hospital; haply he may be cured and recover health."" ""on my head be it!"" replied the camel man; but he said to himself, ""how shall i take this sick man to damascus, and he nigh upon death?"" so he carried him away to a place and hid with him till the night, when he threw him down on the ash heap near the fire hole of a hammam and went his way. when morning dawned the stoker  of the bath came to his work and, finding zau al-makan cast on his back, exclaimed, ""why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here?"" so saying, he gave him a kick and he moved; whereupon quoth the fireman, ""some one of you who hath eaten a bit of hashish and hath thrown himself down in whatso place it be!"" then he looked at his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace and comeliness; so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick and a stranger in the land. and he cried, ""there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah! verily, i have sinned against this youth, for indeed the prophet (whom allah bless and keep!) enjoineth honour to the stranger, more especially when the stranger is sick."" then he carried him home and went in with him to his wife and bade her tend him. so she spread him a sleeping rug and set a cushion under his head, then warmed water for him and washed therewith his hands and feet and face. meanwhile, the stoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar, and sprinkled zau al-makan's face with the water and gave him to drink of the sherbet. then he fetched a clean shirt and put it on him. with this, zau al-makan sniffed the zephyr of health and recovery returned to him; and he sat up and leant against the pillow. hereat the fireman rejoiced and exclaimed, ""praise be to allah for the welfare of this youth! o allah, i beseech thee by thy knowledge of hidden things, that thou make the salvation of this youth to be at my hands!""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the fifty-fourth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the fireman exclaimed, ""o allah, i beseech thee of thy knowledge of hidden things, that thou make this young man's life the work of my hands!"" and he ceased not to nurse him for three days, giving him to drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rose water; and doing him all manner of service and kindness, till health began to return to his body and zau al-makan opened his eyes. presently came in the fireman and, seeing him sitting up and showing signs of amendment, said to him, ""what is now thy state, o my son?"" ""praise be to allah,"" replied zau al-makan, ""i am well and like to recover, if such be the will of allah almighty at this time."" the stoker praised the lord of all for this and, wending fast to the market, bought ten chickens, which he carried to his wife and said, ""kill two of these for him every day, one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day."" so she rose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled, and fed him with the flesh and made him drink its broth. when he had done eating, she fetched hot water and he washed his hands and lay back upon the pillow, whereupon she covered him up with the coverlet, and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer. then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it; after which she cut it up and, bringing it to zau al-makan, said, ""eat, o my son!"" while he was eating; behold, her husband entered and seeing her feeding him, sat down at his head and said to him, ""how is it with thee now, o my son?"" ""thanks be to allah for recovery!"" he replied: ""may the almighty requite thee thy kindness to me."" at this the fireman rejoiced and going out, bought sherbet of violets and rose water and made him drink it. now the stoker used to work at the hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams, whereof he spent every day, for zau al-makan, one dirham upon sugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower water,  and another dirham for fowls; and he ceased not to entreat him thus kindly during a whole month, till the traces of illness ceased from him and he was once more sound and whole. thereupon the fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him, ""o my son, wilt thou go with me to the bath?""; whereto he answered, ""yes!"" so the stoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy, and he mounted zau al-makan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till they came to the bath. then he made him sit down and seated the donkey boy in the furnace-room and went forth to the market and bought iote leaves and lupin-flour,  with which he returned to the bath and said to zau al-makan, ""o my master, in allah's name, walk in and i will wash thy body."" so they entered the inner room of the bath, and the fireman took to rubbing zau al-makan's legs and began to wash his body with the leaves and meal, when there came to them a bathman, whom the bath keeper had sent to zau al-makan; and he, seeing the stoker washing and rubbing him, said, ""this is doing injury to the keeper's rights."" replied the fireman, ""the master overwhelmeth us with his favours!"" then the bathman proceeded to shave zau al-makan's head, after which he and the stoker washed themselves and returned to the house, where he clad zau al-makan in a shirt of fine stuff and a robe of his own; and gave him a handsome turband and girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck. meanwhile the fireman's wife had killed and cooked two chickens; so, as soon as zau al-makan entered and seated himself on the carpet, the husband arose and, dissolving sugar in willow flower water, made him drink of it. then he brought the food tray and, cutting up the chickens, fed him with the flesh and gave him the broth to drink till he was satisfied; when he washed his hands and praised allah for recovery, and said to the fireman, ""thou art he whom the almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause of my cure!"" ""leave this talk,"" replied the other, ""and tell us the cause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art. thy face showeth signs of gentle breeding."" ""tell me first how thou camest to fall in with me,"" said zau al-makan; ""and after i will tell thee my story."" rejoined the fireman, ""as for that, i found thee lying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house, as i went to my work near the morning, and knew not who had thrown thee there. so i carried thee home with me; and this is all my tale."" quoth zau al-makan, ""glory to him who quickeneth the bones, though they be rotten! indeed, o my brother, thou hast not done good save to one worthy of it, and thou shalt presently gather its fruitage."" and he added, ""but where am i now?"" ""thou art in the city of jerusalem,"" replied the stoker; where upon zau al-makan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered his separation from his sister and wept. then he discovered his secret to the fireman and told him his story and began repeating,  ""in love they bore me further than my force would go, * and for             them made me suffer resurrection throe: oh, have compassion, cruel! on this soul of mine * which, since             ye fared, is pitied by each envious foe; nor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance * my case to             lighten, easing this excess of woe: quoth i 'heart, bear this loss in patience!' patience cried *              'take heed! no patience in such plight i'm wont to show.' ""  then he redoubled his weeping, and the fireman said to him, ""weep not, but rather praise allah for safety and recovery."" asked zau al-makan, ""how far is it hence to damascus?"" answered the other, ""six days' journey."" then quoth zau al-makan, ""wilt thou send me thither?"" ""o my lord,"" quoth the stoker, ""how can i allow thee to go alone, and thou a youth and a stranger to boot? if thou would journey to damascus, i am one who will go with thee; and if my wife will listen to and obey me and accompany me, i will take up my abode there; for it is no light matter to part with thee."" then said he to his wife, ""wilt thou travel with me to damascus of syria or wilt thou abide here, whilst i lead this my lord thither and return to thee? for he is bent upon going to damascus of syria and, by allah, it is hard to me to part with him, and i fear for him from highway men."" replied she, ""i will go with you both;"" and he rejoined, ""praised be allah for accord, and we have said the last word!"" then he rose and selling all his own goods and his wife's gear,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say,  when it was the fifty-fifth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the fire man and his wife agreed with zau al-makan to travel with him damascus wards. then the stoker sold his goods and his wife's gear and bought a camel and hired an ass for zau al-makan; and they set out, and ceased not wayfaring for six days till they reached damascus. and they arrived there towards eventide; when the fireman went forth and, as was his wont, bought some meat and drink. they had dwelt but five days in damascus, when his wife sickened and, after a short illness, was translated to the mercy of almighty allah. her death was a heavy matter to zau al-makan, for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously; and the fireman grieved for her with excessive grief. presently the prince turned to the stoker and finding him mourning, said to him, ""grieve not, for at this gate we must all go in."" replied he, ""allah make weal thy lot, o my son! surely he will compensate us with his favours and cause our mourning to cease. what sayst thou, o my son, about our walking abroad to view damascus and cheer thy spirits?"" replied zau al-makan, ""thy will is mine."" so the fireman arose and placed his hand in that of zau al- makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables of the viceroy of damascus, where they found camels laden with chests and carpets and brocaded stuffs, and horses ready saddled and bactrian dromedaries, while mamelukes and negro slaves and folk in a hubbub were running to and fro. quoth zau al-makan, ""i wonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs!"" so he asked one of the eunuchs, ""whither this dispatching?'' and he answered, ""these are presents sent by the emir of damascus to king omar bin al-nu'uman, with the tribute of syria."" now when zau al-makan heard his father's name his eyes brimmed over with tears, and he began repeating,  ""oh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne, * ye whose sight              in my spirit shall ever dwell! your charms are gone, but this heart of me * hath no sweet, and              no pleasures its sour dispel; if allah's grace make us meet again, * in long drawn love-tale my              love i'll tell.""  and when he had ended his verse, he wept and the fireman said to him, ""o my son, we hardly believed that thy health had returned;  so take heart and do not weep, for i fear a relapse for thee."" and he ceased not comforting and cheering him, whilst zau al-makan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood and separation from his sister and his family; and tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets,  ""get thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way, *            and know how surely death descends thy life lot to waylay: all thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine; * all            thy worldly life is vexing, of thy soul in vain display: say is not worldly wone like a wanderer's place of rest, * where            at night he 'nakhs'  his camels and moves off at dawn            of day?""  and he continued to weep and wail over his separation; whilst the fireman also bewept the loss of his wife, yet ceased not to comfort zau al-makan till morning dawned. when the sun rose, he said to him, ""meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land?"" ""yes,"" replied zau al-makan, ""and i can no longer tarry here; so i will commend thee to allah's care and set out with these folk and journey with them, little by little, till i come to my mother land."" said the stoker, ""and i with thee; for of a truth i cannot bear to part with thee. i have done thee kindly service and i mean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel."" at this, zau al-makan rejoiced and said, ""allah abundantly requite thee for me!"" and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together. the fireman at once went forth and bought another ass, selling the camel; and laid in his provaunt and said to zau al-makan, ""this is for thee to ride by the way; and, when thou art weary of riding, thou canst dismount and walk."" said zau al-makan, ""may allah bless thee and aid me to requite thee! for verily thou hast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother."" then he waited till it was dark night, when he laid the provisions and baggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey. this much befel zau al-makan and the fireman; but as regards what happened to his sister nuzhat al-zaman, when she left her brother in the khan where they abode and, wrapped in the old camlet, went out to seek service with some one, that she might earn wherewithal to buy him the roast meat he longed for, she fared on, weeping and knowing not whither to go, whilst her mind was occupied with thoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land. so she implored allah almighty to do away with these calamities from them and began versifying,  ""dark falls the night and passion comes sore pains to gar me             dree, * and pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my            tormentry, and cease not separation flames my vitals to consume, * and            drives me on destruction way this sorrow's ecstacy and longing breeds me restlessness; desire for ever fires, * and           tears to all proclaim what i would keep in secrecy no cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure, * that i may             quit this sickly state, may cure my malady: the love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel, * the            lover from its hell of fire must bear hell's agony!  o thou who blamest me for all befel me, 'tis enough, * patient i            bear what ever wrote the reed of doom for me: by love i swear i'll never be consoled, no, never more; * i swear              the oath of love's own slaves who know no perjury: o night, to chroniclers of love the news of me declare; * that            sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bear!""  then she walked on, weeping and turning right and left as she went, when behold, there espied her an old badawi  who had come into the town from the desert with wild arabs other five. the old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely, but she had nothing on her head save a piece of camlet, and, marvelling at her beauty, he said to himself, ""this charmer dazzleth men's wits but she is in squalid condition, and whether she be of the people of this city or she be a stranger, i needs must have her."" so he followed her, little by little, till he met her face to face and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane, and called out to her, asking her case, and said, ""tell me, o my little daughter! art thou a free woman or a slave?"" when she heard this, she said to him, ""by thy life, do not add to my sorrows!"" quoth he, ""allah hath blessed me with six daughters, of whom five died and only one is left me, the youngest of all; and i came to ask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger; that i might take thee and carry thee to her, to bear her company so as to divert her from pining for her sisters. if thou have no kith and kin, i will make thee as one of them and thou and she shall be as my two children."" nuzhat al-zaman bowed her head in bashfulness when she heard what he said and communed with herself, ""haply i may trust myself to this old man."" then she said to him, ""o nuncle, i am a maiden of the arabs and a stranger and i have a sick brother; but i will go with thee to thy daughter on one condition, which is, that i may spend only the day with her and at night may return to my brother. if thou strike this bargain i will fare with thee, for i am a stranger and i was high in honour among my tribe, and i awoke one morning to find myself vile and abject. i came with my brother from the land of al-hijaz and i fearless he know not where i am."" when the badawi heard this, he said to himself, ""by allah, i have got my desire!"" then he turned to her and replied, ""there shall none be dearer to me than thou; i wish thee only to bear my daughter company by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliest nightfall. or, if thou wilt, bring him over to dwell with us."" and the badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her, till she trusted in him and agreed to serve him. then he walked on before her and, when she followed him, he winked to his men to go in advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with their packs and place upon them water and provisions, ready for setting out as soon as he should come up with the camels. now this badawi was a base born churl, a highway thief and a traitor to the friend he held most fief, a rogue in grain, past master of plots and chicane. he had no daughter and no son and was only passing through the town when, by the decree of the decreer, he fell in with this unhappy one. and he ceased not to hold her in converse on the highway till they came without the city of jerusalem and, when outside, he joined his companions and found they had made ready the dromedaries. so the badawi mounted a camel, having seated nuzhat al-zaman behind him and they rode on all night. then she knew that the badawi's proposal was a snare and that he had tricked her; and she continued weeping and crying out the whole night long, while they journeyed on making for the mountains, in fear any should see them. now when it was near dawn, they dismounted from their dromedaries and the badawi came up to nuzhat al-zaman and said to her, ""o city strumpet, what is this weeping? by allah, an thou hold not thy peace, i will beat thee to death, o thou town filth!"" when she heard this she loathed life and longed for death; so she turned to him and said, ""o accursed old man, o gray beard of hell, how have i trusted thee and thou hast played me false, and now thou wouldst torture me?"" when he heard her reply he cried out, ""o lazy baggage, dost thou dare to bandy words with me?"" and he stood up to her and beat her with a whip, saying, ""an thou hold not thy peace, i will kill thee!"" so she was silent awhile, then she called to mind her brother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tears secretly. next day, she turned to the badawi and said to him, ""how couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these bald and stony mountains, and what is thy design with me?"" when he heard her words he hardened his heart and said to her, ""o lazy baggage of ill omen and insolent! wilt thou bandy words with me?"" and he took the whip and came down with it on her back till she felt faint. then she bowed down over his feet and kissed  them; and he left beating her and began reviling her and said, ""by the rights of my bonnet,  if i see or hear thee weeping, i will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thy coynte, o thou city filth!"" so she was silent and made him no reply, for the beating pained her; but sat down with her arms round her knees and, bowing her head upon her collar, began to look into her case and her abasement after her lot of high honour; and the beating she had endured; and she called to mind her brother and his sickness and forlorn condition, and how they were both strangers in a far country, which crave her tears down her cheeks and she wept silently and began repeating,  ""time hath for his wont to upraise and debase, * nor is lasting            condition for human race: in this world each thing hath appointed turn; * nor may man             transgress his determined place: how long these perils and woes? ah woe * for a life, all woeful             in parlous case! allah bless not the days which have laid me low * i' the world,             with disgrace after so much grace! my wish is baffled, my hopes cast down, * and distance forbids me              to greet his face: o thou who passeth that dear one's door, * say for me, these              tears shall flow evermore!""  when she had finished her verses, the badawi came up to her and, taking compassion on her, bespoke her kindly and wiped away her tears. then he gave her a barley scone and said, ""i love not one who answereth at times when i am in wrath: so henceforth give me no more of these impertinent words and i will sell thee to a good man like myself, who will do well with thee, even as i have done."" ""yes; whatso thou doest is right,"" answered she; and when the night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her, she ate very little of that barley bread. in the middle of the night the badawi gave orders for departure,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the fifty-sixth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the badawi gave the barley scone to nuzhat al-zaman and promised he would sell her to a good man like himself, she replied, ""whatso thou doest is right!"" and, about midnight when hunger burned her,  she ate a very little of that barley bread and the badawi ordered his party to set out; so they loaded their loads and he mounted a camel setting nuzhat al-zaman behind him. then they journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days, till they entered the city of damascus and alighted at the sultan's khan, hard by the viceroy's gate. now she had lost her colour by grief and the fatigue of such travelling, and she ceased not to weep over her misfortunes. so the badawi came up to her and said, ""o thou city filth, by the right of my bonnet, if thou leave not this weeping, i will sell thee to none but a jew!"" then he arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber, and walked off to the bazar, and he went round to, the merchants who dealt in slave girls, and began to parley with them, saying, ""i have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill, and i sent him to my people about jerusalem, that they might tend him till he is cured. as for her i want to sell her, but after the dog her brother fell sick, the separation from him was grievous to her, and since then she doth nothing but weep, and now i wish that whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her and say, 'thy brother is with me in jerusalem ill'; and i will be easy with him about her price."" then one of the merchants came up to him and asked, ""how old is she?"" he answered ""she is a virgin, just come to marriageable age, and she is endowed with sense and breeding and wit and beauty and loveliness. but from the day i sent her brother to jerusalem, her heart hath been yearning for him, so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened."" now when the merchant heard this, he set forth with the badawi and said, ""o shaykh  of the arabs, i will go with thee and buy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit and manners and beauty and loveliness; and i will pay thee her price but it must be upon conditions which if thou accept, i will give thee ready money, and if thou accept not i will return her to thee."" quoth the badawi, ""an thou wilt, take her up to the sultan sharrkan, son of omar bin al-nu'uman lord of baghdad and of the land of khorasan, and condition me any conditions thou likest, for when thou hast brought her before king sharrkan, haply she will please him, and he will pay thee her price and a good profit for thyself to boot."" rejoined the merchant, ""it happens that i have just now something to ask from him, and it is this that he write me an order upon the office, exempting me from custom dues and also that he write me a letter of recommendation to his father, king omar bin al-nu'uman. so if he take the girl, i will weigh  thee out her price at once."" ""i agree with thee to this condition,"" answered the badawi. so they returned together to the place where nuzhat al-zaman was and the wild arab stood at the chamber door and called out, saying, ""o nájiyah !"" which was the name wherewith he had named her. when she heard him, she wept and made no answer. then he turned to the merchant and said to him, ""there she sitteth; go to her and look at her and speak to her kindly as i enjoined thee."" so the trader went up to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrous beautiful and loveable, especially as she knew the arabic tongue; and he said to the badawi, ""if she be even as thou saddest, i shall get of the sultan what i will for her."" then he bespake her, ""peace be on thee, my little maid! how art thou?"" she turned to him and replied, ""this also was registered in the book of destiny."" then she looked at him and, seeing him to be a man of respectable semblance with a handsome face, she said to herself, ""i believe this one cometh to buy me;"" and she continued, ""if i hold aloof from him, i shall abide with my tyrant and he will do me to death with beating. in any case, this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for better treatment from him than from my brute of a badawi. may be he cometh only to hear me talk; so i will give him a fair answer."" all this while her eyes were fixed on the ground; then she raised them to him and said in a sweet voice, ""and upon thee be peace, o my lord, and allah's mercy and his benediction!  this is what is commanded of the prophet, whom allah bless and preserve! as for thine enquiry how i am, if thou wouldst know my case, it is such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe."" and she held her peace. when the merchant heard what she said, his fancy took wings for delight in her and, turning to the badawi, he asked him, ""what is her price, for indeed she is noble?"" thereupon the badawi waxed angry and answered, ""thou wilt turn me the girl's head with this talk! why dost thou say that she is noble,  while she is of the scum of slave girls and of the refuse of folk? i will not sell her to thee!"" when the merchant heard this, he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him, ""calm thyself, for i will buy her of thee with these blemishes thou mentionest."" ""and how much wilt thou give me for her?"" enquired the badawi. replied the merchant, ""name thy price for her: none should name the son save his sire."" rejoined the badawi, ""none shall name it but thou thyself."" quoth the merchant to himself, ""this wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head. by allah, i cannot tell her price, for she hath won my heart with her fair speech and good looks; and, if she can read and write, it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser. but this badawi does not know her worth."" then he turned and said to him, ""o shaykh of the arabs, i will give thee in ready money, clear of the tax and the sultan's dues, two hundred gold pieces."" now when the badawi heard this, he flew into a violent rage and cried at the merchant, saying, ""get up and go thy ways! by allah, wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit of camlet she weareth, i would not sell it to thee. and now i will not sell her, but will keep her by me, to pasture the camels and grind my grist."" and he cried out to her, saying, ""come here, thou stinkard! i will not sell thee."" then he turned to the merchant and said to him, ""i used to think thee a man of judgment; but, by the right of my bonnet, if thou begone not from me, i will let thee hear what shall not please thee!"" quoth the merchant to himself, ""of a truth this badawi is mad and knoweth not her value, and i will say no more to him about her price at the present time; for by allah, were he a man of sense, he would not say, 'by the rights of my bonnet!' by the almighty, she is worth the kingdom of the chosroës and i have not her price by me, but if he ask even more, i will give him what he will, though it be all my goods."" then he turned and said to him, ""o shaykh of the arabs, take patience and calm thyself and tell me what clothes she hath with thee?"" cried the badawi, ""and what hath the baggage to do with clothes? by allah, this camlet in which she is wrapped is ample for her."" ""with thy leave,"" said the merchant, ""i will unveil her face and examine her even as folk examine slave girls whom they think of buying.""  replied the other, ""up and do what thou wilt and allah keep thy youth! examine her outside and inside and, if thou wilt, strip off her clothes and look at her when she is naked."" quoth the trader, ""allah forfend! i will look at naught save her face.""  then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness,—and shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the fifty-seventh night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the merchant went up to nuzhat al-zaman and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness, so he sat by her side and asked her, ""o my mistress, what is thy name?"" she answered, ""doss thou ask what is my name this day or what it was before this day?"" thereupon the merchant enquired, ""hast thou then two names: to day's and yesterday's?"" ""yes,"" replied she, ""my name in the past was nuzhat al-zaman, the delight of the age; but my name at this present is ghussat  al-zaman, the despight of the age."" when the merchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth he to her, ""hast thou not a sick brother?"" ""ay by allah, o my lord, i have,"" quoth she, ""but fortune hath parted me and him and he lieth sick in jerusalem."" the merchant's head was confounded at the sweetness of her speech and he said to himself, ""verily, the badawi spake the truth of her."" then she called to mind her brother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separation from him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what had befallen him; and she thought of all that had happened to her with the badawi and of her severance from her mother and father and native land; and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fast as they started they dropped; and she began reciting,  ""allah, where'er thou be, his aid impart * to thee, who distant              dwellest in my heart! allah be near thee how so far thou fare; * ward off all shifts of             time, all dangers thwart! mine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight, * and start my             tears-ah me, how fast they start! would heaven i kenned what quarter or what land * homes thee, and            in what house and tribe thou art a fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose, * while drink i              tear drops for my sole desert? an thou 'joy slumber in those hours, when i * peel 'twixt my side            and couch coals' burning smart? all things were easy save to part from thee, * for my sad heart            this grief is hard to dree.""  when the merchant heard her verses, he wept and put out his hand to wipe away the tears from her cheeks; but she let down her veil over her face, saying, ""heaven forbid, o my lord!''  then the badawi, who was sitting at a little distance watching them, saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe the tears from her cheeks; and he concluded that she would have hindered him from handling her: so he rose and running to her, dealt her, with a camel's halter he had in his hand, such a blow on the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face. her eyebrow struck a stone which cut it open, and the blood streamed down her cheeks; whereupon she screamed a loud scream and felt faint and wept bitterly. the merchant was moved to tears for her and said in himself, ""there is no help for it but that i buy this damsel, though at her weight in gold, and free her from this tyrant."" and he began to revile the badawi whilst nazhat al- zaman lay in sensible. when she came to herself, she wiped away the tears and blood from her face; and she bound up her head: then, raising her glance to heaven, she besought her lord with a sorrowful heart and began repeating,  ""and pity one who erst in honour throve, * and now is fallen into              sore disgrace. she weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears, * and asks             'what cure can meet this fatal case?'""  when she had ended her verse, she turned to the merchant and said in an undertone, ""by the almighty, do not leave me with a tyrant who knoweth not allah the most high! if i pass this night in his place, i shall kill myself with my own hand: save me from him, so allah save thee from gehenna-fire."" then quoth the merchant to the badawi, ""o shaykh of the arabs, this slave is none of thine affair; so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt."" ""take her,"" quoth the badawi, ""and pay me down her price, or i will carry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camels and gather their dung.""  said the merchant, ""i will give thee fifty thousand diners for her."" ""allah will open!""  replied the badawi. ""seventy thousand,"" said the merchant. ""allah will open!"" repeated the badawi: ""this is not the capital spent upon her, for she hath eaten with me barley bread to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces."" the merchant rejoined, ""thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your lives have not eaten a thousand ducats' worth of barley; but i will say thee one word, wherewith if thou be not satisfied, i will set the viceroy of damascus on thee and he will take her from thee by force."" the badawi continued, ""say on!"" ""an hundred thousand,"" quoth the merchant. ""i have sold her to thee at that price,"" answered the badawi; ""i shall be able to buy salt with her."" the merchant laughed and, going to his lodgings, brought the money and put it into the hand of the badawi, who took it and made off, saying to himself, ""needs must i go to jerusalem where, haply, i shall happen on her brother, and i will bring him here and sell him also."" so he mounted and journeyed till he arrived at jerusalem, where he went to the khan and asked for zau al-makan, but could not find him. such was the case with him; but for what regards the merchant and nazhat al-zaman, when he took her he threw some of his clothes over her and carried her to his lodgings,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the fifty-eighth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the trader saved nuzhat al-zaman from the badawi and bore her to his lodgings and robed her in the richest raiment, he went down with her to the bazar, where he bought her what ornaments she chose and put them in a satin bag, which he set before her, saying, ""all is for thee and i ask nothing of thee in return but that, when i lead thee to the sultan, viceroy of damascus, thou acquaint him with the price i paid for thee, albeit it was little compared with thy value: and, if seeing thee he buy thee of me, thou tell him how i have dealt with thee and ask of him for me a royal patent, and a written recommendation wherewith i can repair to his father, king omar bin al-nu'uman, lord of baghdad, to the intent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goods in which i traffic."" when she heard his words, she wept and sobbed, and the merchant said to her, ""o my lady, i observe that, every time i mention baghdad, thine eyes are tearful: is there any one there whom thou lovest? if it be a trader or the like, tell me; for i know all the merchants and so forth there and, if thou wouldst send him a message, i will bear it for thee."" replied she, ""by allah, i have no acquaintance among merchant folk and the like! i know none there but king omar bin nu'uman, lord of baghdad."" when the merchant heard her words, he laughed and rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself, ""by allah, i have won my wish!"" then he said to her, ""hast thou been shown to him in time past?"" she answered, ""no, but i was brought up with his daughter and he holdeth me dear and i have high honour with him; so if thou wouldst have the king grant thee thy desire, give me ink case and paper and i will write thee a letter; and when thou reachest the city of baghdad, do thou deliver it into the hand of king omar bin al-nu'uman and say to him, 'thy handmaid, nuzhat al-zaman, would have thee to know that the chances and changes of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer, and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place to place, and she sendeth thee her salams.' and, if he ask further of her, say that i am now with the viceroy at damascus."" the merchant wondered at her eloquence, and his affection for her increased and he said to her i cannot but think that men have played upon thine understanding and sold thee for money. tell me, dost thou know the koran by heart?"" ""yes,"" answered she; ""and i am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and the prolegomena of science and the commentaries of galen, the physician, on the canons of hippocrates; and i have commented him and i have read the tazkirah and have commented the burhán; and i have studied the simples of ibn baytár, and i have something to say of the canon of meccah, by avicenna. i can ree riddles and can solve ambiguities, and discourse upon geometry and am skilled in anatomy i have read the books of the sháfi'í  school and the traditions of the prophet and syntax; and i can argue with the olema and discourse of all manner learning. moreover i am skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making of talismans and almanacs, and i know thoroughly the spiritual sciences  and the times appointed for religious duties and i understand all these branches of knowledge."" then quoth she to the merchant, ""bring me ink case and paper, that i write thee a letter which shall aid thee on thy journey to baghdad and enable thee to do without passports."" now when the merchant heard this, he cried out ""brava! brava!  then o happy he in whose palace thou shalt! thereupon he brought her paper and ink case and a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do her honour. she took a sheet and handled the reed and wrote therewith these verses,  ""i see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown; * say, did            thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wone? what makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart? * hath             every lover strength such memories to own? how sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day; *             'tis gone and ere i taste its sweets afar 'tis flown: i pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news * from thee,             to lover wightwi' love so woe begone complains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn, * for parting              pangs can break not only heart but stone.""  and when she had ended writing the verses she continued, ""these words are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her and that watching wasteth her; in the murk of whose night is found no light and darkness and day are the same in her sight. she tosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackened with the pencils of sleeplessness; she watcheth the stars arise and into the gloom she strains her eyes: verily, sadness and leanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of her case would run to length. no helper hath she but tears and she reciteth these verses,  'no ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light, * but              shakes my very frame with sorrow's killing might: no lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart * to meet his              mate, but breeds in me redoubled blight i bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me, * ah me, how love              can part man's mortal frame and sprite!' "" then her eyes welled over with tears, and she wrote also these two couplets,  ""love smote my frame so sore on parting day, * that severance              severed sleep and eyes for aye. i waxt so lean that i am still a man, * but for my speaking, thou              wouldst never say.""  then she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet, ""this cometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land, the sorrowful hearted woman nuzhat al-zaman."" in fine, she folded the sheet and gave it to the merchant, who took it and kissed it and understood its contents and exclaimed, ""glory to him who fashioned thee!""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the fifty-ninth night,  she said, it reached me, o auspicious king, that nuzhat al-zaman wrote the letter and gave it to the merchant; and he took it and read it and understood the contents and exclaimed, ""glory to him who fashioned thee!"" then he redoubled his kindness and made himself pleasant to her all that day, and when night came he sallied out to the bazar and bought some food, wherewith he fed her; after which he carried her to the hammam and said to the bath woman, ""as soon as thou hast made an end of washing her head, dress her and send and let me know of it."" and she replied ""hearing is obeying."" meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and wax candles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath; and when the tire woman had done washing her, she dressed her and led her out of the bath and seated her on the bench. then she sent to tell the merchant, and nuzhat al-zaman went forth to the outer room, where she found the tray spread with food and fruit. so she ate and the tire woman with her, and gave the rest to the people and keeper of the bath. then she slept till the morning, and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her. when he aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her, presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchief worth a thousand diners, a suit of turkish embroidery and walking boots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems. moreover, he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with a fine pearl therein, worth a thousand diners, and threw round her neck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amber beads that hung down between her breasts over her navel. now to this chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents, and each crescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby, and each ball a bezel of balass: the value of the chain was three thousand diners and each of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams, so that the dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money. when she had put these on, the merchant bade her adorn herself, and she adorned herself to the utmost beauty; then she let fall her fillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchant preceding her. but when folk saw her, all wondered at her beauty and exclaimed, ""blessed be allah, the most excellent creator! o lucky the man in whose house the hall be!"" and the trader ceased not walking (and she behind him) till they entered the palace of sultan sharrkan; when he sought an audience and, kissing the earth between his hands, said, ""o auspicious king, i have brought thee a rare gift, unmatched in this time and richly gifted with beauty and with good qualities."" quoth the king, ""let me see it."" so the merchant went out and brought her, she following him till he made her stand before king sharrkan. when he beheld her, blood yearned to blood, though she had been parted from him in childhood and though he had never seen her, having only heard a long time after her birth that he had a sister called nuzhat al- zaman and a brother zau al-makan, he having been jealous of them, because of the succession. and such was the cause of his knowing little about them. then, having placed her before the presence, the merchant said, ""o king of the age, besides being peerless in her time and beauty and loveliness, she is also versed in all learning, sacred and profane, including the art of government and the abstract sciences."" quoth the king to the trader, ""take her price, according as thou boughtest her, and go thy ways."" ""i hear and i obey,"" replied the merchant; ""but first write me a patent, exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise."" said the king, ""i will do this, but first tell me what price thou paidest for her."" said the merchant, ""i bought her for an hundred thousand diners, and her clothes cost me another hundred thousand."" when the sultan heard these words, he declared, ""i will give thee a higher price than this for her;"" and, calling his treasurer, said to him, ""pay this merchant three hundred and twenty thousand ducats; so will he have an hundred and twenty thousand diners profit."" thereupon the sultan summoned the four kazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said, ""i call you to witness that i free this my slave girl and purpose to marry her."" so the kazis wrote out the deed of emancipation and the contract of marriage, when the sultan scattered much gold on the heads of those present; and the pages and the eunuchs picked up this largesse. then, after paying him his monies, sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent, exempting him from toll, tax or tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding each and every in all his government to molest him, and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honour.—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the sixtieth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that king sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate, after paying him his monies; and they wrote a perpetual patent, exempting him from the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in his government to molest him; and lastly bestowed upon him a splendid dress of honour. then all about him retired, and none remained save the kazis and the merchant, whereupon said he to the judges, ""i wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may prove her knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by this trader, that we ascertain the truth of his assertions."" they answered, ""there is no evil in that!""; and he commanded the curtain to be let down between him and those with him and the maiden and those with her; and the women about the damsel behind the curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet, when they learned that she was become the king's wife. then they came round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weight of her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness. presently the wives of the emirs and wazirs heard that king sharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty and learning and philosophy and account keeping, and versed in all branches of knowledge, that he had paid for her three hundred and twenty thousand dinars, and that he had set her free and had written a marriage contract with her and had summoned the four kazis to make trial of her, how she would answer all their questions and hold disputetion with them. so they asked leave of their husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was nuzhat al- zaman. when they came in to her, they found the eunuchs standing before her; and, as soon as she saw the wives of the emirs and wazirs and grandees of the realm coming to call upon her, she arose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy, her handmaidens standing behind her, and she received them saying, ""ye be welcome!"" the while she smiled in their faces so as to win their hearts; and she promised them all manner of good and seated them in their proper stations, as if she had been brought up with them; so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said to one another, ""this damsel is none other than a queen, the daughter of a king."" then they sat down, magnifying her worth and said to her, ""o our lady, this our city is illumined by thee, and our country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured by thy presence. the kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palace is thy palace, and we all are thy handmaids; so, by allah, do not shut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty."" and she thanked them for this. all this while the curtains were let down between nuzhat al-zaman and the women with her, on the one side, and king sharrkan and the four kazis and the merchant seated by him on the other. presently king sharrkan called to her and said, ""o queen, the glory of thine age, this merchant hath described thee as being learned and accomplished; and he claimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge, even to astrology: so let us hear something of all this he hath mentioned, and favour us with a short discourse on such subjects."" she replied, saying: ""o king, to hear is to obey.  the first subjects whereof i will treat are the art of government and the duties of kings and what behoveth governors of command meets according to religious law, and what is incumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners. know then, o king, that all men's works tend either to religious or to laical life, for none attaineth to religion save through this world, because it is the best road to futurity. now the works of this world are not ordered save by the doings of its people, and men's doings are divided into four divisions, government, commerce, husbandry and craftsmanship. now government requireth perfect administration with just and true judgment; for government is the pivot of the edifice of the world, which world is the road to futurity; since allah almighty hath made the world for his servants as viaticum to the traveller for the attainment of his goal; and it befitteth each man that he receive of it such measure as shall bring him to allah, and that he follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust. if folk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity, all cause of contention would be cut off; but they take thereof with violence ant after their own desires, and their persistence therein giveth rise to contentions; so they have need of the sultan, that he do justice between them and order their affairs; and, if the king restrain not his folk from one another, the strong will drive the weak to the wall. hence ardeshir  saith, 'religion and kingship be twins'; religion is a hidden treasure and the king is its keeper; and the divine ordinances and men's intelligence point out that it behoveth the people to adopt a sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and do the weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence of the proud and the rebels against rule. for know, o king, that according to the measure of the sultan's good morals, even so will be the time; as saith the apostle of allah (on whom be peace and salvation!), 'there be two classes who, if they be good, the people will be good; and if they be bad, the people will be bad, even the olema and the emirs.' and it is said by a certain sage, 'there be three kinds of kings, the king of the faith, the king who protecteth things to which reverence is due, and the king of his own lusts.' the king of the faith obligeth his subjects to follow their faith, and it behoveth he be the most faithful,  for it is by him that they take pattern in the things of the faith; and it becometh the folk to obey him in whatso he commandeth according to divine ordinance; but he shall hold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented, because of submission to the decrees of destiny. as for the king who protecteth things to be reverenced, he upholdeth the things of the faith and of the world and compelleth his folk to follow the divine law and to preserve the rights of humanity; and it fitteth him to unite pen and sword; for whoso declineth from what pen hath written his feet slip and the king shall rectify his error with the sharp sword and dispread his justice over all mankind. as for the king of his own lusts, he hath no religion but the following his desire and, as he feareth not the wrath of his lord who set him on the throne, so his kingdom inclineth to deposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition. and sages say, 'the king hath need of many people, but the people have need of but one king' wherefore it beseemeth that he be well acquainted with their natures, that he reduce their discord to concord, that with his justice be encompass them all and with his bounties overwhelm them all. and know, o king, that ardeshir, styled jamr shadíd, or the live coal, third of the kings of persia, conquered the whole world and divided it into four divisions and, for this purpose, get for himself four seal rings, one for each division. the first seal was that of the sea and the police of prohibition and on it was written, alterna lives. the second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies, and on it was written, building up. the third was the seal of the provisioning department and on it was written, plenty. the fourth was the seal of the oppressed, and on it was written, justice. and these usages remained valid in persia until the revelation of al-islam. chosroës also wrote his son, who was with the army, 'be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee.'—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the sixty-first night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that chosroës wrote his son, 'be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee; nor be thou niggardly with them, or they will murmur against thee. give thy giving deliberately and confer thy favours advisedly; open thy hand to them in time of success and stint them not in time of distress.' there is a legend that a desert arab came once to the caliph al- mansúr  and said, 'starve thy dog and he shall follow thee.' when the caliph heard his words, he was enraged with the arab, but abu 'l-abbás of tús said to him, 'i fear that if some other than thou should show him a scone, the dog would follow him and leave thee alone.' thereupon the caliph al-mansur's wrath subsided and he knew that the wild arab had intended no offence and ordered him a present. and know, o king, that abd al-malik bin marwán wrote to his brother abd al-azíz, when he despatched him to egypt, as follows, 'pay heed to thy secretaries and thy chamberlains, for the secretaries will acquaint thee with estate fished matters and the chamberlains with matters of official ceremony, whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known to thee.' omar bin al-khattáb  (whom allah accept!) when engaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with four conditions; the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts, the second that he should not wear fine clothes, the third that he should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should not put off praying till after the proper period. it is said that there is no wealth more profitable than understanding, and there is no understanding like common sense and prudence, and there is no prudence like piety; that there is no means of drawing near to god like good morals, no measure like good breeding, no traffic like good works and no profit like earning the divine favour; that there is no temperance like standing within the limits of the law, no science like that of meditation, no worship like obeying the divine commends, no faith like modesty, no calculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge. so guard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what it compriseth; and think of death and doom ere it ariseth. saith ali (whose face allah honour!), 'beware of the wickedness of women and be on thy guard against them: consult them not in aught;  but grudge not complaisance to them, lest they greed for intrigue.' and eke quoth he, 'whoso leaveth the path of moderation his wits become perplexed'; and there be rules for this which we will mention, if it be allah's will. and omar (whom allah accept!) saith, 'there are three kinds of women, firstly the true believing, heaven fearing, love full and fruit full, who helpeth her mate against fate, not helping fate against her mate; secondly, she who loveth her children but no more and, lastly, she who is a shackle allah setteth on the neck of whom he will.' men be also three: the wise when he exerciseth his own judgement; the wiser who, when befalleth somewhat whereof he knoweth not the issue, seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth by their advice; and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right way nor heeding those who would guide him straight. justice is indispensable in all things; even slave girls have need of justice; and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live by violenting mankind, for did they not deal equitably among themselves and observe justice in dividing their booty, their order would fall to pieces.  in short, for the rest, the prince of noble qualities is beneficence cum benevolence; and how excellent is the saying of the poet,  by open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribe's command; * go and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee.'  and quoth another,  'in ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect, * and              truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soul: whoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the world's good              word, * on glory's course must ever be the first to gain the              goal.'""  and nazhat al-zaman discoursed upon the policy of kings till the bystanders said, ""never have we seen one reason of rule and government like this damsel! haply she will let us hear some discourse upon subject other than this."" when she heard their words and understood them she said, ""as for the chapter of good breeding, it is wide of comprehension, being a compend of things perfect. now it so happened that one day there came to the caliph mu'áwiyah  one of his companions, who mentioned the people of irak and the goodness of their wit; and the caliph's wife maysún, mother of yezíd, heard his words. so, when he was gone, she said to the caliph, 'o prince of the faithful, i would thou let some of the people of irak come in and talk to thee, that i may hear their discourse.' therewith mu'awiyah said to his attendants, 'see who is at the door?' and they answered, 'the banu tamim.' 'let them come in,' said he. so they came in and with them al-ahnáf son of kays.  then quoth mu'awiyah, 'enter, o abu bahr,' and drew a curtain between himself and maysun, that she might hear what they said without being seen herself; then he said to al-ahnaf, 'o son of the sea, draw near and tell me what counsel thou hast for me.' quoth al-ahnaf, 'part thy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluck thine armpits and shave thy pubes  and ever use the toothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues, and make the ghusl or complete ablution on friday, as an expiation for all between the fridays.'—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the sixty-second night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that ahnaf bin kays replied to al-mu'awiyah's  question, 'and ever use the toothstick, because therein be two end seventy virtues and make the complete friday ablution as an expiation for all between the two fridays.' quoth mu'awiyah, 'what is thy counsel to thyself?' 'to set my feet firmly on the ground, to move them deliberately and watch over them with mine eyes!' 'how dost thou order thyself when thou goest in to one not of the nobles of thy tribe?' 'i lower mine eyes modestly and i salute first; i avoid what concerneth me not and i spare my words!' 'and how when thou goest in to thine equals?' 'i give ear to them when they speak and i do not assail them when they err!' 'when thou goest in to thy chiefs?' 'i salute without making any sign and await the reply: if they bid me draw near, i draw near, and if they draw off from me i withdraw!' 'how dost thou with thy wife?' quoth ahnaf, 'excuse me from answering this, o commander of the faithful!'; but mu'awiyah cried, 'i conjure thee inform me.' he said, 'i entreat her kindly and show her familiarity and am large in expenditure, for woman was created of a crooked rib.'  'and how dost thou when thou hast a mind to lie with her?' 'i bid her perfume herself and kiss her till she is moved to desire; then, should it be as thou knowest,  i throw her on her back. if the seed abide in her womb i say, 'o allah make it blessed and let it not be a wastrel, but fashion it into the best of fashions!'  then i rise from her to ablution and first i pour water over my hands and then over my body and lastly, i praise allah for the joy he hath given me.' said mu'awiyah, 'thou hast answered right well and now tell me what be thy requirements?' said ahnaf, 'i would have thee rule thy subjects in the fear of allah and do even handed justice between them.' thereupon ahnaf rose to his feet and left the caliph's presence, and when he had gone maysun said, 'were there but this man in irak, he would suffice to it.' then continued nuzhat al-zaman, ""and all this is a section of the chapter of good breeding, and know o king, that muaykib was intendant of the public treasury during the caliphate of omar bin al-khattáb,""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the sixty-third night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that nuzhat al- zaman continued, ""know, o king, that mu'aykib was intendant of the public treasury during the caliphate of omar bin al-khattab; and it so befel him that he saw omar's son and gave him a dirham out of the treasury. thereupon, quoth mu'aykib, 'i returned to my own house, and while i was sitting there behold, a messenger came to me from omar and i was afraid and went to him, and when i came into his presence, in his hand was the dirham i had given his son. he said to me, 'woe to thee mu'aykib! i have found somewhat concerning thy soul.' i asked 'and what is that?'; and he answered, 'it is that thou hast shown thyself a foe to the followers of mohammed (on whom be peace and salvation!) in the matter of this dirham, and thou wilt have to account for it on resurrection day.'  and omar also wrote a letter to abú músá al-ashári  as follows, 'when these presents reach thee, give the people what is theirs and remit to me the rest.' and he did so. now when othman succeeded to the caliphate, he wrote a like letter to abu musa, who did his bidding and sent him the tribute accordingly, and with it came ziyád.  and when ziyad laid the tribute before othman, the caliph's son came in and took a dirham, whereupon ziyad shed tears. othman asked 'why weepest thou?'; and ziyad answered, 'i once brought omar bin al-khattab the like of this and his son took a dirham, where upon omar bade snatch it from his hand. now thy son hath taken of the tribute, yet i have seen none say aught to him or snatch the money from him.' then othman  cried, 'and where wilt thou find the like of omar?' again zayd bin aslam relates of his father that he said, 'i went out one night with omar till we approached a blazing fire. quoth omar, 'o aslam, i think these must be travellers who are suffering from the cold. come, let us join them.' so we walked on till we came to them and behold! we found a woman who had lighted a fire under a cauldron and by her side were two children, both a wailing. said omar, 'peace be with you, o folk of light (for it was repugnant to him to say 'folk of fire'),  what aileth you?' said she, 'the cold and the night trouble us.' he asked, 'what aileth these little people that they weep?'; and she answered, 'they are hungry.' he enquired, 'and what is in this cauldron?'; and she replied, 'it is what i quiet them withal, and allah will question omar bin al- khattab of them, on the day of doom.' he said, 'and what should omar know of their case?' 'why then,' rejoined she, 'should he manage people's affairs and yet be unmindful of them?' thereupon omar turned to me (continned aslam) and cried, 'come with us!' so we set off running till we reached the pay department of his treasury, where he took out a sack containing flour and a pot holding fat and said to me, 'load these on my back!' quoth i, 'o commander of the faithful, i will carry them for thee.' he rejoined, 'wilt thou bear my load for me on the day of resurrection?' so i put the things on his back, and we set off, running, till we threw down the sack hard by her. then he took out some of the flour and put it in the cauldron; and, saying to the woman, 'leave it to me,' he began blowing the fire under the cauldron. now he was a long bearded man  and i saw the smoke issuing from between the hairs of his beard till the flour was cooked, when he took some of the fat and threw it in and said to the woman, 'bed them while i cool it for them.' so they fell to eating till they had eaten their fill, and he left the rest with her. then he turned to me and said, 'o aslam, i see it was indeed hunger made them weep; and i am glad i did not go away ere i found out the cause of the light i saw.'—and shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the sixty-fourth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that nuzhat al- zaman continued, ""it is related that omar passed by a flock of sheep, kept by a mameluke, and asked him to sell him a sheep. he answered, 'they are not mine.' 'thou art the man i sought,' said omar, and bought him and freed him; whereupon the slave exclaimed, 'o allah, as thou hast bestowed on me the lesser emancipation; so vouchsafe me the greater!'  it is also said that omar bin al- khattab was wont to give his servants sweet milk and himself eat coarse fare, and to clothe them softly and himself wear rough garments. he rendered unto all men their due, and exceeded in his giving to them. he once gave a man four thousand dirhams and added thereto a thousand, wherefore it was said to him, 'why dost thou not increase to thy son as thou increasest to this man?' he answered, 'this man's father stood firm at the battle day of ohod.'  al-hasan relates that omar once came back from foray with much money, and that hafsah  approached him and said, 'o commander of the faithful, the due of kinship!' 'o hafsah!' replied he, 'verily allah hath enjoined us to satisfy the dues of kinship, but not with the monies of the true believers. indeed, thou pleasest"" thy family, but thou angerest thy father.' and she went away trailing her skirts.  the son of omar said, 'i implored the lord to show me my father one year after his death, till at last i saw him wiping the sweat from his brow and asked him, 'how is it with thee, o my father?' he answered, 'but for my lord's mercy thy father surely had perished.' then said nuzhat al-zaman, ""hear, o auspicious king, the second division of the first chapter of the instances of the followers of the apostle and other holy men. saith al hasan al-basrí,  not a soul of the sons of adam goeth forth of the world without regretting three things,- failure to enjoy what he hath amassed, failure to compass what he hoped, failure to provide himself with sufficient viaticum for that hereto he goeth.  it was said of sufyan,  'can a man be a religious and yet possess wealth?' he replied, 'yes, so he be patient when grieved and be thankful when he hath received.' abdullah bin shaddád, being about to die, sent for his son mohammed and admonished him, saying, 'o my son, i see the summoner of death summoning me, and so i charge thee to fear allah both in public and private, to praise allah and to be soothfastin thy speech, for such praise bringeth increase of prosperity, and piety in itself is the best of provision for the next world; even as saith one of the poets,  'i see not happiness lies in gathering gold; * the man most pious is man happiest: in truth the fear of god is best of stores, * and god shall make the pious choicely blest.' then quoth nuzhat al-zaman, ""let the king also give ear to these notes from the second section of the first chapter."" he asked her 'what be they?'; and she answered, ""when omar bin abd al-azíz  succeeded to the caliphate, he went to his household and laying hands on all that was in their hold, put it into the public treasury. so the banu umayyah flew for aid to his father's sister, fátimah, daughter of marwan, and she sent to him saying, 'i must needs speak to thee.' so she came to him by night and, when he had made her alight from her beast and sit down, he said to her, 'o aunt, it is for thee to speak first, since thou hast some thing to ask: tell me then what thou wouldst with me.' replied she, 'o commander of the faithful, it is thine to speak first, for thy judgment perceiveth that which is hidden from the intelligence of others.' then said omar, 'of a verity allah almighty sent mohammed as a blessing to some and a bane to others; and he elected for him those with him, and commissioned him as his apostle and took him to himself,'—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the sixty-fifth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that nuzhat al- zaman continued thus, ""said omar, 'verily allah commissioned as his apostle mohammed (upon whom be the benediction of allah and his salvation!), for a blessing to some and a bane to others; and he elected for him those with him and took him to himself, leaving the people a stream whereof they might drink. after him abu bakr  the truth teller became caliph and he left the river as it was, doing what was pleasing to allah. then arose omar and worked a work and strove in holy war and strife where of none might do the like. but when othman arose to power he diverted a streamlet from the stream, and mu'awiyah in his turn diverted from it several streamlets; and without ceasing in like manner, yezid and the banu marwán such as abd al-malik and walíd and sulaymán  drew away water from the stream, and the main course dried up, till rule devolved upon me, and now i am minded to restore the stream to its normal condition.' when fatimah heard this, she said, 'i came wishing only to speak and confer with thee, but if this be thy word, i have nothing to say to thee.' then she returned to the ommiades and said to them, 'now take ye the consequences of your act when ye allied yourselves by marriage with omar bin al-khattab.'  and it is also said that when omar was about to die, he gathered his children round him, and maslamah  bin abd al-malik said to him, 'o prince of the faithful, how wilt thou leave thy children paupers and thou their protector? none can hinder thee in thy lifetime from giving them what will suffice them out of the treasury; and this indeed were better than leaving the good work to him who shall rule after thee.' omar looked at him with a look of wrath and wonder and presently replied, 'o maslamah, i have defended them from this sin all the days of my life, and shall i make them miserable after my death? of a truth my sons are like other men, either obedient to almighty allah who will prosper them, or disobedient and i will not help them in their disobedience. know, o maslamah, that i was present, even as thou, when such an one of the sons of marwanwas buried, and i fell asleep by him and saw him in a dream given over to one of the punishments of allah, to whom belong honour and glory! this terrified me and made me tremble, and i vowed to allah, that if ever i came to power, i would not do such deeds as the dead man had done. i have striven to fulfil this vow all the length of my life and i hope to die in the mercy of my lord.' quoth maslamah, 'a certain man died and i was present at his burial, and when all was over i fell asleep and i saw him as a sleeper seeth a dream, walking in a garden of flowing waters clad in white clothes. he came up to me and said: 'o maslamah, it is for the like of this that rulers should rule.' many are the instances of this kind, and quoth one of the men of authority, 'i used to milk the ewes in the caliphate of omar bin abd al-aziz, and one day i met a shepherd, among whose sheep i saw a wolf or wolves. i thought them to be dogs, for i had never before seen wolves; so i asked, 'what dost thou with these dogs?' 'they are not dogs, but wolves,' answered the shepherd. quoth i, 'can wolves be with sheep and not hurt them?' quoth he, 'when the head is whole, the body is whole.'  omar bin abd al-aziz once preached from a pulpit of clay and, after praising and glorifying allah almighty, said three words as follows, 'o folk, make clean your inmost hearts, that your outward lives may be dean to your brethren, and abstain ye from the things of the world. know that between us and adam there is no one man alive among the dead. dead are abd al- malik and those who forewent him, and omar also shall die and those who forewent him.' asked maslamah, 'o commander of the faithful, an we set a pillow behind thee, wilt thou lean on it a little while?' but omar answered, 'i fear lest it be a fault about my neck on resurrection day.' then he gasped with the death rattle and fell back in a faint; whereupon fatimah cried out, saying, 'ho, maryam! ho, muzahim!  ho, such an one! look to this man!' and she began to pour water on him weeping, till he revived from his swoon; and, seeing her in tears said to her, 'what causeth thee to weep, o fatimah?' she replied, 'o commander of the faithful, i saw thee lying prostrate before us and thought of thy prostration in death before almighty allah, of thy departure from the world and of thy separation from us. this is what made me weep.' answered he, 'enough, o fatimah, for indeed thou exceedest.' then he would have risen, but fell down and fatimah strained him to her and said, 'thou art to me as my father and my mother, o commander of the faithful! we cannot speak to thee, all of us.' then quoth nuzhat al-zaman to her brother sharrkan and the four kazis, ""here endeth the second section of the first chapter.""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the sixty-sixth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that nuzhat al- zaman said to her brother sharrkan and the four kazis, ""here endeth the second section of the first chapter. and it so happened that omar bin abd al-aziz wrote to the people of the festival at meccah as follows, 'i call allah to witness, in the holy month, in the holy city and on the day of the greater pilgrimage,  that i am innocent of your oppression and of his wrongs that doth wrong you, in that i have neither commanded this nor purposed it, neither hath any report of aught thereof hitherto reached me, nor have i compassed any knowledge thereof; and i trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that none hath authority from me to oppress any man, for i shall assuredly be questioned concerning every one oppress. and if any of my officers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the holy book and the traditions of the apostle do authorise, obey him not so that he may return to the way of righteousness.' he said also (allah accept of him!), 'i do not wish to be relieved from death, because it is the supreme thing for which the true believer is rewarded.' quoth one of authority, 'i went to the prince of the faithful, omarbin abd al-aziz, who was then caliph, and saw before him twelve dirhams, which he ordered for deposit in the public treasury. so i said to him, 'o commander of the faithful, thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggary having nothing whereon to live. an thou wouldst appoint somewhat by will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thy house, it were well.' 'draw near to me,' answered he: so i drew near to him and he said, 'now as for thy saying, 'thou beggarest thy children; provide for them and for the poor of thy household,' it is without reason; for allah of a truth will replace me to my children and to the poor of my house, and he will be their guardian. verily, they are like other men; he who feareth allah, right soon will allah provide for him a happy issue, and he that is addicted to sins, i will not up hold him in his sin against allah.' then he summoned his sons who numbered twelve, and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears and presently he said to them, 'your father is between two things; either ye will be well to do, and your parent will enter the fire, or ye will be poor and your parent will enter paradise; and your father's entry into paradise is liefer to him than that ye should be well to do.  so arise and go, allah be your helper, for to him i commit your affairs!' khálid bin safwán  said, 'yúsuf bin omar  accompanied me to hishám bin abd al-malik,  and as i met him he was coming forth with his kinsmen and attendants. he alighted and a tent was pitched for him. when the people had taken their seats, i came up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining and looked at him; and, waiting till my eyes met his eyes, bespoke him thus, 'may allah fulfil his bounty to thee, o commander of the faithful, i have an admonition for thee, which hath come down to us from the history of the kings preceding thee!' at this, he sat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me, 'bring what thou hast, o son of safwan!' quoth i, 'o commander of the faithful, one of the kings before thee went forth in a time before this thy time, to this very country and said to his companions, 'saw ye ever any state like mine and say me, hath such case been given to any man even as it hath been given unto me?' now there was with him a man of those who survive to bear testimony to truth; upholders of the right and wayfarers in its highway, and he said to him, 'o king, thou askest of a grave matter. wilt thou give me leave to answer?' 'yes,' replied the king, and the other said, 'dost thou judge thy present state to be short lasting or ever lasting?' 'it is temporary,' replied the king. 'how then,' rejoined the man, 'do i see thee exulting in that which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thou wilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering an account whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned?' quoth the king, 'whither shall i flee and what must i seek for me?' 'that thou abide in thy kingship,' replied the other, 'or else robe thee in rags  and apply thyself to obey almighty allah thy lord until thine appointed hour. i will come to thee again at daybreak.' khalid bin safwan further relates that the man knocked at the door at dawn and behold, the king had put off his crown and resolved to become an anchorite, for the stress of his exhortation. when hishám bin abd al-malik heard this, he wept till his beard was wet, and, bidding his rich apparel be put off, shut himself up in his palace. then the grandees and dependents came to khalid and said, 'what is this thou hast done with the commander of the faithful? thou hast troubled his pleasure and disturbed his life!' then quoth nuzhat al-zaman, addressing herself to sharrkan, ""how many instances of admonition are there not in this chapter! of a truth i cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting,""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the sixty-seventh night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that nuzhat al- zaman continued, speaking to sharrkan, ""know, o king, that in this chapter be so many instances of admonition that of a truth i cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting but, with length of days, o king of the age, all will be well."" there said the kazis, ""o king, of a truth this damsel is the wonder of the world, and of our age the unique pearl! never heard we her like in the length of time or in the length of our lives."" and they called down blessings on the king and went away. then sharrkan turned to his attendants and said, ""begin ye to prepare the marriage festival and make ready food of all kinds."" so they forthright did his bidding as regards the viands, and he commanded the wives of the emirs and wazirs and grandees depart not until the time of the wedding banquet and of the unveiling of the bride. hardly came the period of afternoon prayer when the tables were spread with whatso heart can desire or eye can delight in of roast meats and geese and fowls; and the subjects ate till they were satisfied. moreover, sharrkan had sent for all the singing women of damascus and they were present, together with every slave girl of the king and of the notables who knew how to sing. and they went up to the palace in one body. when the evening came and darkness starkened they lighted candles, right and left, from the gate of the citadel to that of the palace; and the emirs and wazirs and grandees marched past before king sharrkan, whilst the singers and the tire women took the damsel to dress and adorn her, but found she needed no adornment. meantime king sharrkan went to the hammam and coming out, sat down on his seat of estate, whilst they paraded the bride before him in seven different dresses: after which they eased her of the weight of her raiment and ornaments and gave such injunctions as are enjoined upon virgins on their wedding nights. then sharrkan went in unto her and took her maidenhead;  and she at once conceived by him and, when she announced it, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and commanded the savants to record the date of her conception. on the morrow he went forth and seated himself on his throne, and the high officers came in to him and gave him joy. then he called his private secretary and bade him write a letter to his father, king omar bin al-nu'uman, saying that he had bought him a damsel, who excels in learning and good breeding and who is mistress of all kinds of knowledge. moreover he wrote, ""there is no help but that i send her to baghdad to visit my brother zau al-makan and my sister nuzhat al-zaman. i have set her free and married her and she hath conceived by me."" and he went on to praise her wit and salute his brother and sister together with the wazir dandan and all the emirs. then he sealed the letter and despatched it to his father by a post courier who was absent a whole month, after which time he returned with the answer and presented it in the presence. sharrkan took it and read as follows, ""after the usual bismillah, this is from the afflicted distracted man, from him who hath lost his children and home by bane and ban, king omar bin al- nu'uman, to his son sharrkan. know that, since thy departure from me, the place is become contracted upon me, so that no longer i have power of patience nor can i keep my secret: and the cause thereof is as follows. it chanced that when i went forth to hunt and course zau al-makan sought my leave to fare hijaz wards, but i, fearing for him the shifts of fortune, forbade him therefrom until the next year or the year after. my absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the sixty-eighth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that king omar bin al-nu'uman wrote in his letter, ""my absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month, and when i returned i found that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money and had set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth. when i knew this, the wide world narrowed on me, o my son! but i awaited the return of the caravan, hoping that haply they would come back with it. accordingly, when the palmers appeared i asked concerning the twain, but they could give me no news of them; so i donned mourning for them, being heavy at heart, and in sleep i have no part and i am drowned in the tears of my eyes."" then he wrote in verse,  ""that pair in image quits me not one single hour, * whom in my              heart's most honourable place i keep: sans hope of their return i would not live one hour, * without my              dreams of them i ne'er would stretch me in sleep.""  the letter went on, ""and after the usual salutations to thee and thine, i command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of them for indeed this is a shame to us."" when sharrkan read the letter he felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brother and sister. then he took the missive and went in with it to nuzhat al-zaman who knew not that he was her brother, nor he that she was his sister, albeit he often visited her both by night and by day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on the stool of delivery. allah made the child birth easy to her and she bare a daughter, whereupon she sent for sharrkan and seeing him she said to him, ""this is thy daughter: name her as thou wilt."" quoth he, ""it is usual to name children on the seventh day after birth. "" then he bent over the child to kiss it and he saw, hung about its neck, a jewel, which he knew at once for one of those which princess abrizah had brought from the land of the greeks. now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babe's neck he recognised it right well, his senses fled and wrath seized on him; his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at nuzhat al- zaman and said to her, ""whence hadst thou this jewel, o slave girl?"" when she heard this from sharrkan she replied, ""i am thy lady, and the lady of all in thy palace! art thou not ashamed to say to me slave girl? i am a queen, daughter of king omar bin al-nu'uman."" hearing this, he was seized with trembling and hung his head earthwards,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the sixty-ninth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when sharrkan heard these words, his heart fluttered and his colour waxed yellow and he was seized with trembling and he hung his head earthwards, for he knew that she was his sister by the same father. then he lost his senses; and, when he revived, he abode in amazement, but did not discover his identity to her and asked, o my lady, say, art thou in sooth the daughter of king omar bin al- nu'uman?"" ""yes,"" answered she; and he continued, ""tell me the cause of thy leaving thy sire and of thy being sold for a slave."" so she related to him all that had befallen her from beginning to end, how she had left her brother sick in the sanctified city, jerusalem, and how the badawi had kidnapped her and had sold her to the trader. when sharrkan heard this, he was certified of her being his sister on the sword side and said to himself, ""how can i have my sister to wife? by allah, needs must i marry her to one of my chamberlains; and, if the thing get wind, i will declare that i divorced her before consummation and married her to my chief chamberlain."" then he raised his head and sighing said, ""o nuzhat al-zaman, thou art my very sister and i cry: 'i take refuge with allah from this sin whereinto we have fallen,' for i am sharrkan, son of omar bin al-nu'uman."" she looked at him and knew he spoke the truth; and, becoming as one demented, she wept and buffeted her face, exclaiming, ""there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah! verily have we fallen into mortal sin!  what shall i do and what shall i say to my father and my mother when they ask me, whence hadst thou thy daughter?"" quoth sharrkan, ""it were meetest that i marry thee to my chamberlain and let thee bring up my daughter in his house, that none may know thou be my sister. this hath befallen us from almighty allah for a purpose of his own, and nothing shall cover us but thy marriage with this chamberlain, ere any know."" then he fell to comforting her and kissing her head and she asked him, ""what wilt thou call the girl?"" ""call her kuzia fakán,""  answered he. then he gave the mother in marriage to the chief chamberlain, and transferred her to his house with the child, which they reared on the laps of the slave girls, and fed with milk and dosed with powders. now all this occurred whilst the brother, zau al-makan, still tarried with the fireman at damascus. one day there came to king sharrkan a courier from his father, with a letter which he took and read and found therein, ""after the bismillah know, o beloved king, that i am afflicted with sore affliction for the loss of my children: sleep ever faileth me and wakefulness ever assaileth me. i send thee this letter that, as soon as thou receivest it, thou make ready the monies and the tribute, and send them to us, together with the damsel whom thou hast bought and taken to wife; for i long to see her and hear her discourse; more especially because there hath come to us from roumland an old woman of saintly bearing and with her be five damsels high bosomed virgins, endowed with knowledge and good breeding and all arts and sciences befitting mortals to know; and indeed tongue faileth me to describe this old woman and these who with her wend; for of a truth they are compendiums of perfections in learning and accomplishments. as soon as i saw them i loved them, and i wished to have them in my palace and in the compass of my hand; for none of the kings owneth the like of them; so i asked the old woman their price and she answered, 'i will not sell them but for the tribute of damascus.' and i, by allah, did not hold this price exorbitant, indeed it is but little, for each one of them is worth the whole valuation. so i agreed to that and took them into my palace, and they remain in my possession. wherefore do thou forward the tribute to us that the woman may return to her own country; and send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors; and, if she prevail over them, i will return her to thee accompanied by the tribute of baghdad.""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the seventieth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that king omar son of al-nu'uman said in his letter, ""and send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and, if she prevail over them, i will return her to thee accompanied with the tribute of baghdad."" as soon as sharrkan knew the contents, he went in to his brother in law and said to him, ""bring the damsel to whom i married thee;"" and when she came he showed her the letter and said, ""o my sister! what answer wouldst thou advise me make to this letter?"" replied she, ""seek advice from thyself!"" and presently added (for she yearned after her people and her native land), ""send me together with my husband the chamberlain, to baghdad, that i may tell my father my tale and let him know whatso befel me with the badawi who sold me to the merchant, and that i also inform him how thou boughtest me of the trader and gavest me in marriage to the chamberlain, after setting me free."" ""be it so,"" replied sharrkan. then sharrkan took his daughter, kuzia fakan, and committed her to the charge of the wet nurses and the eunuchs, and he made ready the tribute in haste, bidding the chamberlain travel with the princess and the treasure to baghdad. he also furnished him two travelling litters one for himself and the other for his wife. and the chamberlain replied, ""to hear is to obey."" moreover sharrkan collected camels and mules and wrote a letter to his father and committed it to the chamberlain; then he bade farewell to his sister, after he had taken the jewel from her and hung it round his daughter's neck by a chain of pure gold; and she and her husband set out for baghdad the same night. now it so happened that zau al-makan and his friend the fireman had come forth from the hut in which they were, to see the spectacle, and they beheld camels and bukhti  dromedaries and bât-mules and torches and lanterns alight; and zau al-makan enquired about the loads and their owner and was told that it was the tribute of damascus going to king omar bin al-nu'uman, lord of the city of baghdad. he then asked, ""who be the leader of the caravan?"" and they answered, ""the head chamberlain who hath married the damsel so famous for learning and science."" thereupon zau al-makan wept with bitter weeping and was minded of his mother and his father and his sister and his native land, and he said to the stoker, ""i will join this caravan and, little by little, will journey homewards."" quoth the fireman, ""i would not suffer thee to travel single handed from the holy city to damascus, then how shall i be sure of thy safety when thou farest for baghdad? but i will go with thee and care for thee till thou effectest thine object."" ""with joy and good will,"" answered zau al-makan. then the fireman get him ready for the journey and hired an ass and threw saddle bags over it and put therein something of provaunt; and, when all was prepared, he awaited the passage of the caravan. and presently the chamberlain came by on a dromedary and his footmen about him. then zau al-ma ken mounted the ass and said to his companion, ""do thou mount with me."" but he replied, ""not so: i will be thy servant."" quoth zau al-makan, ""there is no help for it but thou ride awhile."" ""'tis well,"" quoth the stoker; ""i will ride when i grow tired."" then said zau al-makan, ""o my brother, soon shalt thou see how i will deal with thee, when i come to my own folk."" so they fared on till the sun rose and,when it was the hour of the noonday sleep  the chamberlain called a halt and they alighted and reposed and watered their camels. then he gave the signal for departure and, after five days, they came to the city of hamáh,  where they set down and made a three days' halt;—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the seventy-first night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that they halted in the city of hamah three days; they then fared forwards and ceased not travelling till they reached another city. here also they halted three days and thence they travelled till they entered the province diyár bakr. here blew on them the breezes of baghdad, and zau al-makan bethought him of his father and mother and native land, and how he was returning to his sire without his sister: so he wept and sighed and complained, and his regrets grew on him, and he began improvising these couplets,  ""sweetheart! how long must i await by so long suffering teed? *             nor cometh messenger to tell me where thou dost abide: ah me! in very sooth our meeting time was short enow: * would             heaven shorter prove to me the present parting-tide! now trend my hand and open my robe and thou within shall sight *             how wasted are the limbs of me and yet the waste i hide: when say they 'comfort take for loss of love' i but reply * 'by             allah, till the day of doom no comfort shall betide!' ""  thereupon said to him the fireman, ""leave this weeping and wailing, for we are near the chamberlain's tent."" quoth zau al- makan, ""needs must i recite somewhat of verse; haply it may quench the fire of my heart."" ""allah upon thee,"" cried the other, ""cease this lamentation till thou come to shine own country; then do what thou wilt, and i will be with thee wherever thou art."" replied zau al-makan, ""by allah! i cannot forbear from this!"" then he turned his face towards baghdad and the moon was shining brightly and shedding her light on the place, and nuzhat al-zaman could not sleep that night, but was restless and called to mind her brother and wept. and while she was in tears, he heard zau al-makan weeping and improvising the following distichs,  'al-yaman's  leven-gleam i see, * and sore despair             despaireth me for friend who erst abode wi' me * crowning my cup with gladdest            gree: it minds me o' one who jilted me * to mourn my bitter liberty. say sooth, thou fair sheet lightning! shall * we meet once more            in joy and glee? o blamer! spare to me thy blame * my lord hath sent this dule to             dree, of friend who left me, fain to flee; * of time that breeds             calamity: all bliss hath fled the heart of me * since fortune proved mine             enemy. he  brimmed a bowl of merest pine, * and made me drain the             dregs, did he: i see me, sweetheart, dead and gone * ere i again shall gaze on            thee. time! prithee bring our childhood back, * restore our happy             infancy, when joy and safety 'joyed we * from shafts that now they shoot             at me! who aids the hapless stranger wight, * that nights in fright and             misery, that wastes his days in lonely grief, * for 'time's              delight'  no more must be? doomed us despite our will to bear * the hands of base bores cark              and care.""  when he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a fainting fit. this is how it fared with him; but as regards nuzhat al- zaman, when she heard that voice in the night, her heart was at rest and she rose and in her joy she called the chief eunuch, who said to her, ""what is thy will?"" quoth she, ""arise and bring me him who recited verses but now."" replied he, ""of a truth i did not hear him""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the seventy-second night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when nuzhat al-zaman heard her brother reciting, she called the chief eunuch and said to him, ""go, fetch me the man who is repeating this poetry!"" replied he, ""of a truth i heard him not and i wot him not and folks are all sleeping."" but she said, ""whomsoever thou seest awake, he is the reciter."" so he went, yet found none on wake save the stoker; for zau al-makan was still insensible, and when his companion saw the eunuch standing by his head he was afraid of him. then said the eunuch, ""art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him?"" the stoker fancied that the dame was wroth with the reciter; and, being afraid, he replied, ""by allah, 'twas not i!"" rejoined the eunuch, ""who then was the reciter?: point him out to me. thou must know who it was, seeing that thou art awake."" the fireman feared for zau al- makan and said in himself, ""haply the eunuch will do him some hurt""; so he answered, ""by allah, i know not who it was."" said the eunuch, ""by allah, thou liest, for there is none on wake here but thou! so needs must thou know him."" ""by allah,"" replied the fireman, ""i tell thee the truth!: some passer by, some wayfarer must have recited the verses and disturbed me and kept me awake; allah requite him!"" quoth the eunuch, ""if thou happen upon him, point him out to me and i will lay hands on him and bring him to the door of our lady's litter  or do thou take him with thine own hand."" said the fireman, ""go thou back and i will bring him to thee."" so the eunuch left him and went his ways; and, going in to his mistress, told her all this and said to her, ""none knoweth who it was; it must have been some passer by, some wayfarer."" and she was silent. meanwhile, zau al-makan came to himself and saw that the moon had reached the middle heavens; the breath of the dawn breeze  breathed upon him and his heart was moved to longing and sadness; so he cleared his throat and was about to recite verses, when the fire man asked him, ""what wilt thou do?"" answered zau al-makan, ""i have a mind to repeat somewhat of poetry, that i may quench therewith the fire of my heart."" quoth the other, ""thou knowest not what befel me whilst thou wast a faint, and how i escaped death only by beguiling the eunuch."" ""tell me what happened,"" quoth zau al-makan. replied the stoker, ""whilst thou wast aswoon there came up to me but now an eunuch, with a long staff of almond tree wood in his hand, who took to looking in all the people's faces, as they lay asleep, and asked me who it was recited the verses, finding none awake but myself. i told him in reply it was some passerby, some wayfarer; so he went away and allah delivered me from him; else had he killed me. but first he said to me, 'if thou hear him again, bring him to us.'"" when zau al-makan heard this he wept and said, ""who is it would forbid me to recite? i will surely recite, befal me what may; for i am near mine own land and care for none."" rejoined the fireman, ""thy design is naught save to lose thy life;"" and zau al-makan retorted, ""needs must i recite verses."" ""verily,"" said the stoker, ""needs must there be a parting between me and thee in this place, albeit;i had intended not to leave thee, till i had brought thee to thy native city and reunited thee with thy mother and father. thou hast now tarried with me a year and a half and i have never harmed thee in aught. what ails thee, then, that thou must needs recite verses, seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep, for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue?"" but zau al-makan answered, ""i will not be turned away from my purpose.""  then grief moved him and he threw off concealment and began repeating these couplets,  ""stand thou by the homes and hail the lords of the ruined stead;           * cry thou for an answer, belike reply to thee shall be            sped: if the night and absence irk thy spirit kindle a torch * wi'            repine; and illuminate the gloom with a gleaming greed: if the snake of the sand dunes hiss, i shall marvel not at all!            * let him bite so i bite those beauteous lips of the            luscious red: o eden, my soul hath fled in despite of the maid i love: * had i            lost hope of heaven my heart in despair were dead."" and he also improvised the two following distichs,  ""we were and were the days enthralled to all our wills, *            dwelling in union sweet and homed in fairest site: who shall restore the home of the beloved, where showed * light             of the place for aye conjoined with time's             delight?''   and as he ceased his verses, he shrieked three shrieks and fell senseless to the ground and the fireman rose and covered him. when nuzhat al-zaman heard the first improvisation, she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home; then she wept and cried at the eunuch and said to him, ""woe to thee! he who recited the first time hath recited a second time and i heard him hard by. by allah, an thou fetch him not to me, i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee, and he shall beat thee and cast thee out. but take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently, and do him no hurt. if he refuse, hand to him this purse of a thousand diners, then leave him and return to me and tell me, after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is. return quickly and linger not.""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the seventy-third night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that nuzhat al- zaman sent the eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer and said, ""beware how thou come back to me and report, i could not find him."" so the eunuch went out and laid about the people and trod in their tents, but found none awake, all being asleep for weariness, till he came to the stoker and saw him sitting up, with his head uncovered. so he drew near and seizing him by the hand, said to him, ""it was thou didst recite the verses!"" the fireman was afeard for his life and replied, ""no, by allah, o chief of the people, it was not i!"" but the eunuch said, ""i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses, for i dread returning to my lady without him."" now when the fireman heard these words he feared for zau al-makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch, ""by allah, it was not i, and i know him not. i only heard some passer by, some wayfarer, recite verses: so do not thou commit sin on me, for i am a stranger and come from the holy city of jerusalem; and abraham, the friend of allah, be with you all."" ""rise up and fare with me,"" rejoined the eunuch, ""and tell my lady this with thine own mouth, for i have seen none awake save thyself."" quoth the stoker, ""hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the place where i now am, and dost thou not know my station? thou wottest none can stir from his place, except the watchman seize him. so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry, whether he be near or far, it will be i or some one i know, and thou shalt not learn of him but by me."" then he kissed the eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away; but the castrato fetched a round and, returning secretly, came and stood behind the fireman, fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings. as soon as he was gone, the stoker arose and aroused zau al-makan and said to him, ""come, sit up, that i may tell thee what hath happened."" so zau al-makan sat up, and his companion told him what had passed, and he answered, ""let me alone; i will take no heed of this and i care for none, for i am mine own country.""  quoth the stoker, ""why wilt thou obey thy flesh and the devil? if thou fear no one, i fear for thee and for my life, so allah upon thee! recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land. indeed, i had not deemed thee so ill conditioned. dost thou not know that this lady is the wife; of the chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her? belike, she is ill or restless for fatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from her home, and this is the second time she hath sent the eunuch to look for thee."" however zau al-makan paid no heed to the fireman's words but cried out a third time and began versifying with these couplets,  ""i fly the carper's injury,* whose carping sorely vexeth me: he chides and taunts me, wotting not * he burns me but more             grievously. the blamer cries 'he is consoled!' * i say, 'my own dear             land  to see:' they ask, 'why be that land so dear?' * i say, 'it taught me in             love to be:' they ask, 'what raised its dignity?' * i say, 'what made my             ignomy:' whate'er the bitter cup i drain, * far be fro' me that land to              flee: nor will i bow to those who blame, * and for such love would deal              me shame.  hardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion, when the eunuch (who had heard him from his hiding place at his head) came up to him; whereupon the fireman flea end stood afar off to see what passed between them. then said the eunuch to zau al-makan, ""peace be with thee, o my lord!"" ""and on thee be peace,"" replied zau al-makan, ""and the mercy of allah and his blessings!"" ""o my lord,"" continued the eunuch—-and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,  when it was the seventy-fourth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the eunuch said to zau al-makan, ""o my lord, i have sought thee these several times this night, for my mistress biddeth thee to her."" quoth zau al- makan, ""and who be this bitch that seeketh for me? allah curse her and curse her husband with her!""  and he began to revile the eunuch, who could make him no answer, because his mistress had charged him to do zau al-makan no hurt, nor bring him save of his own especial free will; and, if he would not accompany him, to give him the thousand diners. so the castrato began to speak him fair and say to him, ""o my lord, take this purse and go with me. we will do thee no upright, o my son, nor wrong thee in aught; but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress, to receive her answer and return in weal and safety: and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news."" when zau al- makan heard this, he arose and went with the eunuch and walked among the sleeping folk, stepping over them; whilst the fireman followed after them from afar, and kept his eye upon him and said to himself, ""alas the pity of his youth! tomorrow they will hang him."" and he ceased not following them till he approached their station,  without any observing him. then he stood still and said, ""how base it will be of him, if he say it was i who bade him recite the verses!"" this was the case of the stoker; but as regards what befel zau al-makan, he ceased not walking with the eunuch till he reached his station and the castrato went in to nuzhat al-zaman and said, ""o my lady, i have brought thee him whom thou soughtest, and he is a youth, fair of face and bearing the marks of wealth and gentle breeding."" when she heard this, her heart fluttered and she cried, ""let him recite some verses, that i may hear him near hand, and after ask him his name and his condition and his native land."" then the eunuch went out to zau al-makan and said to him, ""recite what verses thou knowest, for my lady is here hard by, listening to thee, and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition."" replied he, ""with love and gladness but, an thou ask my name, it is erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste. i have a story, the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of it be shown, and behold, i am even as one who hath exceeded in wine drinking and who hath not spared himself; one who is afflicted with distempers and who wandereth from his right mind, being perplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought."" when nuzhat al-zaman heard this, she broke out into excessive weeping and sobbing, and said to the eunuch, ""ask him if he have parted from one he loveth even as his mother or father."" the castrato asked as she bade him, and zau al-makan replied, ""yes, i have parted from every one i loved: but the dearest of all to me was my sister, from whom fate hath separated me."" when nuzhat al- zaman heard this, she exclaimed, ""allah almighty reunite him with what he loveth!""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the seventy-fifth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when nuzhat al-zaman heard his words she said, ""allah reunite him with what he loveth!"" then quoth she to the eunuch, ""tell him to let me hear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and his country."" the eunuch did so, and zau al-makan sighed heavily and began repeating these couplets,   ""is not her love a pledge by all mankind confest? * the house             that hometh hinda be forever blest' her love all levels; man can reck of naught beside; * naught or            before or after can for man have zest 'tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris * that day            when hinda's footstep on its face is prest: hail to the beauty of our camp, the pride of folk, * the dearling            who en' slaves all hearts by her behest: allah on 'time's delight' send large dropped clouds that teem *            with genial rain but bear no thunder in their breast."" and also these,  ""i vow to allah if at home i sight * my sister nuzhat al-zamani            highs i'll pass the days in joyance and delight * mid bashful minions,              maidens soft and white: to sound of harps in various modes they smite * draining the             bowl, while eyes rain lively light 'neath half closed lids, a sipping lips red bright * by stream             bank flowing through my garden site.""  when he had finished his verse, nuzhat al-zaman lifted up a skirt of the litter curtain and looked at him. as soon as her eyes fell on his face, she knew him for certain and cried out, ""o my brother! o zau al-makan!"" he also looked at her and knew her and cried out, ""o my sister! o nuzhat al-zaman!"" then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit. when the eunuch saw this case, he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them, waited till they should recover. after a while they came to themselves, and nuzhat al-zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy: oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her, and she repeated these verses,  ""time sware my life should fare in woeful waste; * forsworn art            time, expiate thy sin in haste!  comes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid; * to him who brings            good news, rise, gird thy waist i spurned old world tales of eden bliss; * till came i             kausar  on those lips  when zau al-makan heard this, he pressed his sister to his breast; tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and he repeated these couplets,   ""long i lamented that we fell apart, * while tears repentant             railed from these eyne; and sware, if time unite us twain once more, * 'severance' shall             never sound from tongue of mine: joy hath so overwhelmed me that excess * of pleasure from mine             eyes draws gouts of brine: tears, o mine eyes, have now become your wont * ye weep for             pleasure and you weep for pine!""  they sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him, ""come with me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee, and i will tell thee what happened to me."" so they entered and zau al-maken said, ""do thou begin thy tale."" accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the khan and what had happened to her with the badawi; how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother sharrkan and had sold her to him; how he had freed her at the time of buying; how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king, their sire, had sent and asked for her from sharrkan. then quoth she, ""praised be allah who hath vouchsafed thee to me and ordained that, even as we left our father together, so together shall we return to him!"" and she added, ""of a truth my brother sharrkan gave me in marriage to this chamberlain that he might carry me to my father. and this is what befel me from first to last; so now tell me how it hath fared with thee since i left thee."" thereupon he told her all that had happened to him from beginning to end; and how allah vouchsafed to send the fireman to him, and how he had journeyed with him and spent his money on him and had served him night and day. she praised the stoker for this and zau al-makan added, ""of a truth, o my sister, this fireman hath dealt with me in such benevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son, for that he fasted and gave me to eat, and he walked whilst he made me ride; and i owe my life to him."" said she, ""allah willing, we will requite him for all this, according to our power."" then she called the eunuch, who came and kissed zau al- makan's hand, and she said, ""take thy reward for glad tidings, o face of good omen! it was thy hand reunited me with my brother; so the purse i gave thee and all in it are thine. but now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me."" the castrato rejoiced and, going in to the chamberlain, him to his mistress. accordingly, he came in to his wife and finding zau al-makan with her, asked who he was. so she told him all that had befallen them both, first and last, and added, ""know, o chamberlain, that thou hast married no slave girl; far from it, thou hast taken to wife the daughter of king omar bin al-nu'uman for i am nuzhat al- zaman, and this is my brother, zau al-makan."" when the chamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth, and its manifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he was become king omar bin al-nu'uman's son in law, so he said to himself, "" 'twill be my fate to be made viceroy of some province.""  then he went up to zau al-makan and gave him joy of his safety and reunion with his sister, and bade his servants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best of his own horses to ride. thereupon said nuzhat al-zaman, ""we are now near our country and i would be left alone with my brother, that we may enjoy each other's company and take our fill of it ere we reach baghdad; for we have been parted a long, long time."" ""be it as thou biddest,"" replied the chamberlain, and, going forth from them, sent them wax candles and various kinds of sweetmeats, together with three suits of the costliest for zau al-makan. then he returned to the litter and related the good he had done and nuzhat al-zaman said to him, ""bid the eunuch bring me the fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with a tray of food morning and evening, and let him be forbidden to leave us."" the chamberlain called the castrato and charged him to do accordingly; so he replied, ""i hear and i obey;"" and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan, girthing his ass and preparing for flight. the tears were running adown his cheeks, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from zau al-makan; and he was saying to himself, ""indeed, i warned him for the love of allah, but he would not listen to me; oh would i knew what is become of him!"" ere he had done speaking the eunuch was standing by his head whilst the pages surrounded him the fireman turned and seeing the eunuch and the pages gathered around him became yellow with fear,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the seventy-sixth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself, saying, ""oh would i knew what is become of him!""; ere he had done speaking the castrato was standing by his head and his side muscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried, ""verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices i have done him! i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch (hence these pages et about me) and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime."" then the effeminated one cried at him, saying, ""who was it recited the verses? o liar! why didst thou say, 'i never repeated these couplets, nor do i know who repeated them;' when it was thy companion? but now i will not leave thee between this place and baghdad, and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee."" quoth the fireman, ""what i feared hath befallen me."" and he repeated this couplet,  ""'twas as i feared the coming ills discerning: * but unto allah we are all returning.""  then the eunuch cried upon the pages, saying, ""take him off the ass."" so they carried him along with the caravan, surrounded by the pages, as the white contains the black of the eye; and the castrato said to them, ""if a hair of him be lost, you will be lost with it."" and he bade them privily treat him with honour and not humiliate him. but when the stoker saw himself beset by the pages, he despaired of his life and turning to the eunuch, said to him, ""o chief, i am neither this youth's brother nor am i akin to him, nor is he sib to me; but i was a fireman in a hammam and found him cast out, in his sickness, on the dung heap."" then the caravan fared on and the stoker wept and imagined in himself a thousand things, whilst the eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing, but said to him, ""thou disturbedst our mistress by reciting verses, thou and this youth: but fear nothing for thy self;"" and kept laughing at him the while to himself. whenever the caravan halted, they served him with food, and he and the castrato ate from one dish.  then the eunuch bade his lads bring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and, after drinking himself, gave it to the fireman, who drank; but all the while his tears never dried, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from zau al-makan and for what had befallen them in their strangerhood. so they both travelled on with the caravan, whilst the chamberlain now rode by the door of his wife's litter, in attendance on zau al-makan and his sister, and now gave an eye to the fireman; and nuzhat al-zaman and her brother occupied themselves with converse and mutual condolence; and they ceased not after this fashion till they came within three days' journey from baghdad. here they alighted at eventide and rested till the morning morrowed; and as they awoke and they were about to load the beasts, behold, there appeared afar off a great cloud of dust that darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiest night.  thereupon the chamberlain cried out to them, ""stay, and your loading delay!""; then, mounting with his mamelukes, rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud. when they drew near, suddenly appeared under it a numerous conquering host like the full tide sea, with flags and standards, drums and kettledrums, horsemen and footmen. the chamberlain marvelled at this; and when the troops saw him, there detached itself from amongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers, who fell upon him and his suite and surrounded them, five for one; whereupon said he to them, ""what is the matter and what are these troops, that ye do this with us?"" asked they, ""who art thou; and whence comest thou, and whither art thou bound?"" and he answered, ""i am the chamberlain of the emir of damascus, king sharrkan, son of omar bin al-nu'uman, lord of baghdad and of the land of khorasan, and i bring tribute and presents from him to his father in baghdad."" when the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefs fall over their faces and wept, saying, ""in very sooth king omar is dead and he died not but of poison. so fare ye forwards; no harm shall befal you till you join his grand wazir, dandan."" now when the chamberlain heard this, he wept sore and exclaimed, ""oh for our disappointment in this our journey!"" then he and all his suite wept till they had come up with the host and sought access to the wazir dandan, who granted an interview and called a halt and, causing his pavilion to be pitched, sat down on a couch therein and commanded to admit the chamberlain. then he bade him be seated and questioned him; and he replied that he was chamberlain to the emir of damascus and was bound to king omar with presents and the tribute of syria. the wazir, hearing the mention of king omar's name, wept and said, ""king omar is dead by poison, and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselves as to who should succeed him, until they were like to slay one another on this account; but the notables and grandees and the four kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the four judges and that none should gainsay them. so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son, sharrkan, and make him sultan over his father's realm. and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet, zau al-makan, for, quoth they, his name be light of the place, and he hath a sister nuzhat al-zaman highs, the delight of the time; but they set out five years ago for al-hijaz and none wotteth what is become of them."" when the chamberlain heard this, he knew; that his wife had told him the truth of her adventures; and he grieved with sore grief for the death of king omar, albeit he joyed with exceeding joy, especially at the arrival of zau al-makan, for that he would now become sultan of baghdad in his father's stead—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the seventy-seventh night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when sharrkan's chamberlain heard of the death of king omar bin al- nu'uman he mourned, but he rejoiced because of his wife and her brother zau al-makan who would become sultan of baghdad in his father's stead. so he turned to the wazir dandan and said to him, ""verily your tale is a wonder of wonders! know, o chief wazir, that here, where you have encountered me, allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions, for that his almighty will restoreth to you zau al-makan and his sister nuzhat al-zaman; whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can."" when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said, ""o chamberlain, tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence."" so he repeated to him the whole story and told him that nuzhat al-zaman was his wife and related to him the adventures of zau al-makan from first to last. as soon as he had ended his tale, the wazir sent for the emirs and wazirs and chief officers and acquainted them with the matter; whereat they rejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance. then they gathered in a body and went in to the chamberlain and did their service to him, kissing the ground between his hands; and the wazir dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stood before him in honour. after this, the chamberlain held on that day a divan council; and he and the wazir sat upon a throne, whilst all the emirs and grandees and officers of state took their places before them, according to their several ranks.  then they melted sugar in rose water and drank, after which the emirs sat down to hold council and permitted the rest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely, till they should make an end of their debate and overtake them. so the officers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting, rode onwards, preceded by the standards of war. when the grandees had finished their conference, they took horse and rejoined the host; and the chamberlain approached the wazir dandan and said, ""i deem it well to ride on before you, and precede you, that i may get ready a place for the sultan and notify him of your coming and of your choosing him as sultan over the head of his brother sharrkan."" ""aright thou reckest,"" answered the wazir then the chamberlain rose up in haste and dandan also stood up to do him honour and brought him presents, which he conjured him to accept. in similar guise did all the emirs and grandees and officers of state, bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him and saying to him, ""haply thou wilt mention our case to sultan zau al-makan and speak to him to continue us in our dignities.""  the chamberlain promised all they required and bade his pages be ready to march, whereupon the wazir dandan sent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at a day's journey from the city. and they did his bidding. then the chamberlain mounted and rode forward, full of joy and saying to himself, ""how blessed is this gurney!"", and indeed his wife was exalted in his eyes, she and her brother zau al-makan. they made all haste over their wayfare, till they reached a place distant a day's journey from baghdad, where the chamberlain called a halt for rest, and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting place for the sultan zau al-makan, son of king omar bin al-nu'uman, while he rode forward with his mamelukes and, alighting at a distance from nuzhat al-zaman's litter, commanded the eunuchs to ask leave of admission to the presence. they did so and she gave permission; whereupon he went in to her and conversed with her and her brother; and told them of the death of their father; and of zau al-makan, how the heads of the people had made him king over them in the stead of his sire; and he gave them joy of the kingdom. they both wept for their father and asked the manner of his being killed; but the chamberlain answered, ""the news rests with the wazir dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all the host; and it only remaineth for thee, o king, to do what they counsel, since they have unanimously chosen thee sultan; for if thou do not this, they will choose some one else and thou canst not be sure of thy life with another sultan. haply he will kill thee, or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom pass out of the hands of both."" zau al-makan bowed his head awhile and then said, ""i accept this position;"" for indeed there was no refusing; and he was certified that the chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way. then he added, ""o my uncle, how shall i do with my brother sharrkan?"" ""o my son,"" replied the chamberlain, ""thy brother will be sultan of damascus and thou sultan of baghdad; so take heart of grace and get ready thy case."" zau al-makan accepted this and the chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and a dagger  of state, which the wazir dandan had brought with him; then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot of rising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion, wherein the sultan might sit to receive the emirs and grandees. moreover he ordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and he commanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs. they did as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from the ground and spread till it walled the horizon round. after awhile, the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of baghdad and khorasan, a conquering host like the full tide sea.—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the seventy-eighth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the chamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spacious enough to receive the subjects flocking to their sultan, they planted a splendid sháhmiyánah  befitting kings. and as they ended their labours behold, a dust cloud spired aloft and the breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host; and presently it appeared that this was the army of baghdad and khorasan preceded by the wazir dandan. and in it all rejoiced at the accession of the ""light of the place."" now zau al-makan had donned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword of state: so the chamberlain brought him a steed and he mounted surrounded by the mamelukes and all the company from the tents on foot, to do him service, and he rode on until he came to the great pavilion, where he sat down and he laid the royal dagger across his thighs, whilst the chamberlain stood in attendance on him and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entrance awning of the shahmiyanah, with drawn swords in their hands. presently, up came the troops and the host and craved admission so the chamberlain went in to zau al-makan and asked his leave whereupon he bade admit them, ten by ten. the chamberlain acquainted them with the king's commands, to which they replied, ""we hear and we obey;"" and all drew up before the pavilion entrance. then he took ten of them and carried them through the vestibule into the presence of sultan zau al-makan, whom when they saw, they were awed; but he received them with most gracious kindness and promised them all good. so they gave him joy of his safe return and invoked allah's blessings upon him after which they took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught and they kissed ground before him and withdrew. then other ten entered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers; and they ceased not to enter, ten by ten, till none was left but the wazir dandan. lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zau al-makan, who rose to meet him, saying, ""welcome, o wazir and sire sans peer! verily, thine acts are those of a counsellor right dear, and judgement and foreseeing clear are in the hands of the subtle of lere."" then bade he the chamberlain forthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order all the troops thereto. so they came and ate and drank. moreover the sultan commanded his wazir dandan call a ten days' halt of the army, that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain. the wazir obeyed the commands of the sultan with submission and wished him eternity of glory and said, ""this needs must be!"" he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days. they did as he bade them and, moreover, he gave them leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of the lords in waiting should attend upon the king for service during the space of three days. then the wazir went to the sultan and reported all to him, and zau al-makan waited until nightfall, when he went in to his sister nuzhat al-zaman and asked her, ""dost thou know the cause of my father's murder or not?"" ""i have no knowledge of the cause,"" she answered, and drew a silken curtain before herself, whilst zau al-makan seated himself without the curtain and commanded the wazir to the presence and, when he came, said to him, ""i desire thou relate to me in detail the cause of the killing of my sire, king omar bin al-nu'uman!"" ""know then, o king,"" replied dandan, ""that king omar bin al- nu'uman, when he returned to baghdad from his chasing and hunting and entered the city, enquired for thee and thy sister, but could not find you and knew that you twain had gone on the pilgrimage; whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered, and his breast was straitened and he abode thus half a year, seeking news of you from all who came and went but none could give him any tidings. now while we were in attendance upon him one day, after a whole year had sped since ye were lost to his sight, lo! there came to us an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee, accompanied by five damsels, high bosomed virgins like moons, endowed with such beauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe; and, to crown their perfections of comeliness, they could read the koran and were versed in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples. then that old woman sought audience of the king, and he bade admit her; whereupon she entered the presence and kissed the ground between his hands. i was then sitting by his side and he, seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness, made her draw near and take seat hard by him. and when she had sat down she addressed him and said, 'know, o king, that with me are five damsels, whose like no king among the kings possesseth; for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection. they read the koran—and the traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races. they stand here between thy hands to do thee service, o king of the age, and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised. 'thy father, who hath found mercy;  looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him; so he said to them, let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!'—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the seventy-ninth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the wazir dandan said unto king zau al-makan, ""thy father, who hath found mercy, glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and he said to them, 'let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!' thereupon one of them came forward and, kissing the ground before him, spake as follows  'know, o king, that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschew impertinence and adorn himself with excellencies, and observe the divine injunctions and avoid mortal sins; and to this he should apply himself with the assiduity of one who, if he stray therefrom, falleth into perdition; for the foundation of good breeding is virtuous behaviour. and know that the chief cause and reason of man's existence is the endeavour after life everlasting, and the right way thereto is the service of allah. wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people: and swerve not from this canon, for the mightier men are in dignity, the more their need of prudence and foresight; and indeed monarchs need this more than the many, for the general cast themselves into affairs, without taking thought to the issue thereof. be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way of allah, and know that, if an enemy dispute with thee, thou mayst dispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof against him; but as for thy friend, there is none can judge between thee and him save righteousness and fair dealing. choose, therefore, thy friend for thyself, after thou hast proved him. if he be of the brotherhood of futurity,  let him be zealous in observing the externals of the holy law and versed in its inner meaning, as far as may be; and if he be of the brotherhood of the world, let him be free born, sincere, neither a fool nor a perverse, for the fool man is such that even his parents might well flee from him, and a liar cannot be a true friend. indeed the word, siddík  ('friend') deriveth from sidk ('truth') that welleth up from the bottom of the heart; and how can this be the case, when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue? and know, that the observance of the law profiteth him who practiseth it: so love thy brother, if he be of this quality and do not cast him off, even if thou see in him that which irketh thee, for a friend is not i like a wife, whom one can divorce and re-marry: nay, his heart is like glass: once broken, it may not be mended. and allah bless him who saith,  'ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart; * 'tis hard to win              thee back the heart offended: for hearts indeed, whence love is alien made, * like broken glass              may nevermore be mended.'  the maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us what sages say, 'the best of brethren is he who is the most constant in good counsel; the best of action is that which is fairest in its consequence, and the best of praise is not that which is in the mouths of men. it is also said, 'it behoveth not the servant to neglect thanking allah especially for two favours, health and reason.' again it is said, 'whoso honoureth himself, his lust is a light matter to him, and he who maketh much of his small troubles, allah afflicteth him with the greater; he who obeyeth his own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth to the slanderer loseth the true friend. he who thinketh well of thee, do thou fulfill his thought of thee. he who exceedeth in contention sinneth, and he who against upright standeth not on ward, is not safe from the sword. now will i tell thee somewhat of the duties of kazis and judges. know, o king, that no judgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given after proof positive, and it behoveth the judge to treat all people on the same level, to the intent that the great may not hunger for oppression nor the small despair of justice. furthermore he should extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath upon the defendant; and mediation is admissible between moslems, except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbidding the lawful.  if thou shalt have done aught during the day, of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved, thou (o kazi) shouldst revert to the right, for to do justice is a religious obligation and to return to that which is right is better than persistence in wrong. then (o judge) thou shouldest study precedents and the law of the case and do equal justice between the suitors, withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth and committing thine affair to allah (be he extolled and exalted!). and require thou proof of the complainant, and if he adduce evidence let him have due benefit of it; and if not, put the defendant to his oath; for this is the ordinance of allah. receive thou the testimony of competent moslem witnesses, one against other, for almighty allah hath commanded judges to judge by externals, he himself taking charge of the inner and secret things. it behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet, whilst suffering from stress of pain or hunger,  and that in his decisions between folk he seek the face of allah almighty for he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself, allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and the people.' quoth al-zuhri,  'there are three things for which, if they be found in a kazi, he should be deposed; namely, if he honour the base, if he love praise and if he fear dismissal. and omar bin abd al-aziz once deposed a kazi, who asked him, 'why hast thou dismissed me? it hath reached me,' answered omar, 'that thy converse is greater than thy condition.' it is said also that iskandar  said to his kazi, 'i have invested thee with this function and committed to thee in it my soul and mine honour and my manliness; so do thou guard it with thy sense and thine understanding.' to his cook he said, 'thou art the sultan of my body; so look thou tender it as thine own self.' to his secretary he said, 'thou art the controller of my wit: so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me and from me.'"" thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward.—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the eightieth night,  she continued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the wazir dandan said to zau al-makan, ""thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward and, kissing the ground seven times before the king thy father, spake as follows, 'the sage lukmán  said to his son, 'there be three who are known only in three several cases; the merciful man is unknown save in time of wrath, the brave only in battle, and thy friend in time of need.' it is said that the oppressor shall be depress though by people praised, and that the oppress is at rest though by people blamed. quoth allah almighty,  'assuredly deem not that those who rejoice in what they have done, and who love to be praised for what they have not done, shall escape reckoning of punishment: indeed there is reserved for them a grievous penalty.' and he said  (on whom be salvation and salutation!), 'works are according to intention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth.' he said also, 'in the body is a part which being sound the rest is sound, and which being unsound the whole is unsound.' and this is the heart. now this heart is the most marvellous of what is in man, since it is that which ordereth his whole affair: if covetise stir in it, desire destroyeth him, and if affliction master it, anguish slayeth him; if anger rage in it, danger is hard upon him; if it be blest with contentment, he is safe from discontent; if fear surprise it, he is full of mourning; and if calamity overtake it, affliction betideth him. if a man gain the use of wealth, peradventure he is diverted thereby from the remembrance of his lord; if poverty choke him his heart is distracted by woe, or if disquietude waste his heart, weakness causeth him to fall. thus, in any case, nothing profiteth him but that he be mindful of allah and occupy himself with gaining his livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next. it was asked of a certain sage, 'who is the most ill conditioned of men?'; and he answered, 'the man whose lusts master his manhood and whose mind soareth over high, so that his knowledge dispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth; and how excellently saith the poet,  freest am i of all mankind fro' meddling wight * who, seeing             others err, self error ne'er can sight: riches and talents are but loans to creature lent, * each wears             the cloak of that he bears in breast and sprite: if by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make, * thou shalt go             wrong and if the door be right, go right!'  continued the maiden, 'as for anecdotes of devotees, quoth hisham bin bashar, 'i asked omar bin ubayd, what is true piety?'; and he answered, 'the apostle of allah (to whom be salutation and salvation!) hath explained it when he sayeth, the pious is he who forgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth that which endureth to that which passeth away; who counteth not the morrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead.' and it is related that abu zarr  used to say, want is dearer to me than wealth, and unheal is dearer to me than health.' quoth one of the listeners, 'may allah have mercy on abu zarr!'. for my part, i say, 'whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of the election of almighty allah should be content with that condition which allah hath chosen for him.' quoth one of the companions of the prophet, 'ibn abi aufa  once prayed with us the dawn prayer. when he had done, he recited, 'o thou enwrapped!'  till he came to where allah saith, 'when there shall be a trumping on the trumpet,' and fell down dead. it is said that sabit al-banani wept till he well nigh lost his eyes. they brought him a man to medicine him who said to him, 'i will cure thee, provided thou obey my bidding' asked sabit, 'in what matter?' quoth the leach, 'in that thou leave weeping!' 'what is the worth of mine eyes?', rejoined sabit, 'if they do not weep?' quoth a man to mohammed bin abdillah, 'exhort thou me!'""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the eighty-first night,  she continued, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the wazir dandan said to zau al-makan, ""thus spake the second hand maid to the king who hath found mercy, omar bin al-nu'uman. 'quoth a man to mohammed bin abdillah, exhort thou me!' 'i exhort thee,' replied he, 'to be a self ruler, an abstainer in this world, and in the next a greedy slave.' 'how so?' asked the other and mohammed answered, 'the abstinent man in this world conquereth both the world that is and the world to come.' and quoth ghaus bin abdillah, 'there were two brothers among the sons of israel, one of whom said to the other, 'what be the most perilous  thing thou hast done?' replied the brother, 'i once came upon a nest of young birds; so i took out one and threw it back into the nest; but among the chickens were some which drew apart from it. this is the most perilous thing i ever did; now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done?' he rejoined, 'when i arise for prayer i am fearful that it is only for the sake of the reward.' now their father heard these words and exclaimed, 'o allah, an say they sooth take them to thyself!' it was declared by one of the wise men, 'verily, these were of the most virtuous of children.' quoth sa'íd bin jubayr,  'i was once in company with fuzalah bin 'ubaydand said to him, 'exhort thou me!, replied he, 'bear in mind these two necessaries, shun syntheism  and harm not any of allah's creatures.' and he repeated these two couplets,  'be as thou wilt, for allah still is bounteous lord, * and care             dispeller dread not therefore bane and ban to two things only never draw thee nigh, nor give * partner to             allah trouble to thy brother man.' and how well saith the poet,  'an thou of pious works a store neglect * and after death meet              one who did collect, thou shalt repent thou diddest not as he, * nor madest ready as              he did elect.'  then the third damsel came forward, after the second had with drawn, and said, 'of a truth, the chapter of piety is exceeding wide; but i will mention what occurreth to me thereof, concerning the pious of old. quoth a certain holy man, 'i congratulate myself in death, though i am not assured of rest therein, save that i know death interveneth between a man and his works; so i hope for the doubling of good works and the docking off of ill works.' and ita'a al salami, when he had made an end of an exhortation, was wont to tremble and grieve and weep sore; and as they asked him why he did this he answered, 'i desire to enter upon a grave matter, and it is the standing up before almighty allah to do in accordance with my exhortation.' in similar guise zayn al-abidín,  son of al-husayn, was wont to tremble when he rose to pray. being asked the cause of this, he replied, 'know ye not before whom i stand and whom i address?' it is said that there lived near sufyán al-thauri  a blind man who, when the month of ramazan came, went out with the folk to pray,  but remained silent and hung back. said sufyan, 'on the day of resurrection he shall come with the people of the koran and they will be distinguished by increase of honour from their fellows.' quoth sufyan, 'were the soul established in the heart as befitteth, it would fly away for joy and pining for paradise, and for grief and fear of hell-fire.' it is related also of sufyan al-thauri that he said, 'to look upon the face of a tyrant is a sin.' then the third damsel retired and came for ward the fourth, who said, 'here am i to treat of sundry traditions of pious men which suggest themselves to me. it is related that bishr barefoot  said, 'i once heard khálid say, 'beware of secret polytheism.' i asked, 'what may secret polytheism be?'; and he answered, 'when one of you in praying prolong his inclinations and prostrations till a cause of impurity  come upon him.' and one of the sages said, 'doing works of weal expiateth what is ill.' quoth ibrahim,  'i supplicated bishr barefoot to acquaint me with some theological mysteries; but he said, 'o my son, this knowledge it behoveth us not to teach to every one; of every hundred five, even as the legal alms upon money.' said ibrahim, 'i thought his reply excellent and approved of it and while i was praying behold, bishr was also praying: so i stood behind him  making the prayer bow till the mu'ezzin called his call. then rose a man of tattered appearance and said, o folk, beware of a truth which bringeth unweal, for there is no harm in a lie bringing weal,  and in time of need no choice we heed: speech booteth not in the absence of good qualities even as silence hurteth not in the presence of good. presently i saw bishr drop a danik,  so i picked it up and exchanged it for a dirham which i gave him. quoth he, 'i will not take it.' quoth i, 'it is perfectly lawful change'; but he rejoined 'i cannot take in exchange the riches of the present world for those of the future world.' it is related also that bishr barefoot's sister once went to ahmad bin hanbal"" —and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the eighty-second night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the wazir dandan continued to bespeak zau al-makan on this wise, ""and quoth the maiden to thy father, 'bishr barefoot's sister once went to ahmad bin hanbal and said to him, 'o imam of the faith, we are a family that spin thread by night and work for our living by day; and oftentimes the cressets of the watch of baghdad pass by and we on the roof spinning by their light. is this forbidden to us?' asked ahmad:'who are thou?' 'i am the sister of bishr barefoot,' answered she. rejoined the iman, 'o household of bishr, i shall never cease to drink full draughts of piety from your hearts.' quoth one of the sages, 'when allah willeth well to his servant he openeth upon him the gate of action.' málik bin dinár,  when he passed through the bazar and saw aught he desired, was wont to say, 'o soul, take patience, for i will not accord to thee what thou desirest.' he said also (allah accept him!), 'the salvation of the soul lies in resistance to it and its damnation in submission to it.' quoth mansúr bin ammár,  'i made a pilgrimage and was faring meccahwards by way of cufa, and the night was overcast, when i heard a voice crying out from the deeps of the darkness saying, 'o allah, i swear by thy greatness and thy glory, i meant not through my disobedience to transgress against thee; for indeed i am not ignorant of thee; but my fault is one thou didst foreordain to me from eternity without beginning;  so do thou pardon my transgression, for indeed i disobeyed thee of my ignorance!' when he had made an end of his prayer he recited aloud the verse, 'o true believers, save your souls and those of your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones.'  then i heard a fall, but not knowing what it was i passed on. when the morning morrowed, as we went our way, behold, we fell in with a funeral train, followed by an old woman whose strength had left her. i asked her of the dead, and she answered, 'this is the funeral of a man who passed by us yesterday whilst my son was standing at prayer and after his prayers he recited a verse from the book of allah almighty when the man's gall bladder burst and he fell dead.' therewith the fourth damsel retired and the fifth came forward and said, 'i here will also repeat what occurreth to me regarding the acts of devotees in olden time. maslamah bin dinár used to say, 'by making sound the secret thoughts, sins great and small are covered'; and, 'when the servant of allah is resolved to leave sinning, victory cometh to him.' also quoth he, 'every worldly good which doth not draw one nearer to allah is a calamity, for a little of this world distracteth from a mickle of the world to come and a mickle of the present maketh thee forget the whole of the future.' it was asked of abú házim,  'who is the most prosperous of men?'; and he answered, 'whoso spendeth his life in submission to allah.' the other enquired, 'and who is the most foolish of mankind?' 'whoso selleth his future for the worldly goods of others,' replied abu hazim. it is reported of moses  (on whom be peace!) that when he came to the waters of midian he exclaimed, 'o lord, verily i stand in need of the good which thou shalt send down to me.'  and he asked of his lord and not of his folk. there came two damsels and he drew water for them both and allowed not the shepherds to draw first. when the twain returned, they informed their father shu'ayb (on whom be peace!) who said, 'haply, he is hungry,' adding to one of them, 'go back to him and bid him hither.' now when she came to moses, she veiled her face and said, 'my father biddeth thee to him that he may pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for us.' moses was averse to this and was not willing to follow her. now she was a woman large in the back parts, and the wind blowing upon her garment  covered the hinder cheeks to moses; which when moses saw, he lowered his eyes and said to her, 'get thee behind while i walk in front.' so she followed him till he entered the house of shu'ayb where supper was ready.""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the eighty-third night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the wazir dandan continued to zau al-makan, ""now, quoth the fifth damsel to thy sire, 'when moses (on whom be peace!) entered the home of shu'ayb where supper was ready, shu'ayb said to him, 'o moses, i desire to pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for these two.' but moses answered, 'i am of a household which selleth nothing of the fashion of the next world  for what is on earth of gold and silver.' then quoth shu'ayb, 'o youth! nevertheless thou art my guest, and it is my wont and that of my forbears to honour the guest by setting food before him.' so moses sat down and ate. then shu'ayb hired moses for eight pilgrimages, that is to say, eight years, and made his wage marriage with one of his two daughters, and moses' service to him was to stand for her dowry. as saith the holy writ of him, 'verily i will give thee one of these my two daughters in marriage, on condition that thou serve me for hire eight pilgrimages: and if thou fulfil ten years, it is in thine own breast; for i seek not to impose a hardship on thee.'  a certain man once said to one of his friends whom he had not met for many days, 'thou hast made me desolate, for that i have not seen thee this long while.' quoth the other, 'i have been distracted from thee by ibn shiháb: dost thou know him?' quoth his friend, 'yes, he hath been my neighbour these thirty years, but i have never spoken to him.' he replied, 'verily thou forgettest allah in forgetting—thy neighbour! if thou lovedst allah thou wouldst love thy neighbour. knowest thou not that a neighbour hath a claim upon his neighbour,  even as the right of kith and kin?' said huzayfah, 'we entered meccah with ibráhím bin adham, and shakík al-balkhí was also making a pilgrimage that year. now we met whilst circumambulating the ka'abah and ibrahim said to shakik, 'what is your fashion in your country?' replied shakik, 'when we are blest with our daily bread we eat, and when we hunger we take patience.' 'this wise,' said ibrahim, 'do the dogs of balkh; but we, when blest with plenty, do honour to allah and when an hungered we thank him.' and shakik seated himself before ibrahim and said to him, 'thou art my master.' also said mohammed bin imrán, 'a man once asked of hátim the deaf  'what maketh thee to trust in allah?' 'two things,' answered he, 'i know that none save myself shall eat my daily bread, so my heart is at rest as to that; and i know that i was not created without the knowledge of allah, and am abashed before him.' then the fifth damsel retired and the ancient dame came forward and, kissing the ground before thy father nine times, said, 'thou hast heard, o king, what these all have spoken on the subject of piety; and i will follow their example in relating what hath reached me of the famous men of past times. it is said that the imam al-sháfi'í departed the night into three portions, the first for study, the second for sleep and the third for prayer. the imam abú hanífah  was wont also to pass half the night in prayer. one  day a man pointed him out to another, as he walked by and remarked, 'yonder man watcheth the whole night.' when he heard this abu hanifah said, 'i was abashed before allah to hear myself praised for what was not in me'; so after this he used to watch the whole night. and one of the sages hath said,  'who seeketh for pearl in the deep dives deep; * who on high would hie robs his night of sleep.'  al-rabí a relates that al-shafi'i used to recite the whole koran seventy times during the month of ramazan, and that in his daily prayers. quoth al-shafi'i (allah accept him!), 'during ten years i never ate my fill of barley bread, for fullness hardeneth the heart and deadeneth the wit and induceth sleep and enfeebleth one from standing up to pray.'  it is reported of abdullah bin mohammed al-sakrá that he said, 'i was once talking with omar and he observed to me, 'never saw i a more god fearing or eloquent man than mohammed bin idris al-shafi'i.' it so happened i went out one day with al-háris bin labíb al-saffár, who was a disciple of al-muzani  and had a fine voice and he read the saying of the almighty, 'this shall be a day whereon they shall not speak to any purpose, nor shall they be permitted to excuse themselves.'  i saw al-shafi'i's colour change; his skin shuddered with horripilation, he was violently moved and he fell down in a fainting fit when he revived he said, 'i take refuge with allah from the stead of the liars and the lot of the negligent! o allah, before whom the hearts of the wise abase themselves, o allah, of thy bene ficence accord to me the remission of my sins, adorn me with the curtain of thy protection and pardon me my shortcomings, by the magnanimity of thy being!' then i rose and went away. quoth one of the pious, 'when i entered baghdad, al-shafi'i was there. so i sat down on the river bank to make the ablution before prayer; and behold, there passed me one who said, 'o youth, make thy wuzu-ablution well and allah will make it well for thee in this world and in the next.' i turned and lo! there was a man behind whom came a company of people. so i hastened to finish my ablution and followed him. presently, he turned and asked me, 'say, dost thou want aught?' 'yes,' answered i, 'i desire that thou teach me somewhat of that which allah almighty hath taught thee.' he said, 'know then that whoso believeth in allah shall be saved, and whoso jealously loveth his faith shall be delivered from destruction, and whoso practiseth abstinence in this world, his eyes shall be solaced on the morrow of death. shall i tell thee any more?' i replied, 'assuredly;' and he continued, 'be thou of the world that is, heedless; and of the world to come, greediest. be truthful in all thy dealings, and thou shalt be saved with the salvationists.' then he went on and i asked about him and was told that he was the imam al-shafi'i. al-shafi'i was wont to remark, 'i love to see folk profit by this learning of mine, on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the eighty-fourth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the wazir dandan continued to zau al-makan, ""the old woman bespake thy sire, saying, 'the imam al-shafi'i was wont to remark, i love to see folk profit by this learning of mine on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.' he also said, 'i never disputed with any one, but i would that almighty allah should give him the knowledge of the truth and aid him to dispread it: nor did i ever dispute with anyone at all but for the showing forth of the truth, and i reck not whether allah manifest it by my tongue or by his.' he said also (whom allah accept!), 'if thou fear to grow conceited of thy lore, then bethink thee whose grace thou seekest and for what good thou yearnest and what punishment thou dreadest.' it was told to abu hanífah that the commander of the faithful, abú ja'afar al-mansúr, had appointed him kazi and ordered him a salary of ten thousand dirhams; but he would not accept of this; and, when the day came on which the money was to be paid him, he prayed the dawn prayer, then covered his head with his robe—and spoke not. when the caliph's messenger came with the money, he went in to the imam and accosted him, but he would not speak to him. so the messenger said, 'verily this money is lawfully thine.' 'i know that it is lawfully mine,' replied he: 'but i abhor that the love of tyrants get a hold upon my heart.'  asked the other, 'if thou go in to them canst thou not guard thyself from loving them?' answered abu hanifah, 'can i look to enter the sea without my clothes being wet?' another of al-shafi'i's sayings (allah accept him!) is,  'oh soul of me, an thou accept my rede, * thou shalt be wealthy            and of grace entire: cast off ambitious hopes and vain desires, * how many a death was             done by vain desire!'  among the sayings of sufyán al-thaurí, with which he admonished ali bin al-hasan al-salami was, 'be thou a man of truth and 'ware lies and treachery and hypocrisy and pride. be not indebted save to him who is merciful to his debtors; and let thine associate be one who shall dissociate thee from the world. be ever mindful of death and be constant in craving pardon of allah and in beseeching of allah peace for what remaineth of thy life. counsel every true believer, when he asketh thee concerning the things of his faith; and beware of betraying a believer, for whoso betrayeth a believer, betrayeth allah and his apostle. avoid dissensions and litigation; and leave that which causeth doubt in thee for things which breed no doubt:  so shalt thou be at peace. enjoin beneficence and forbid malevolence: so shalt thou be loved of allah. adorn thine inner man and allah shall adorn thine outer man. accept the excuse of him who excuseth self to thee and hate not any one of the moslems. draw near unto those who withdraw from thee and excuse those that misuse thee: so shalt thou be the friend of the prophets. let thine affairs, both public and private, be in allah's charge, and fear him with the fear of one who knoweth he is dead and who fareth towards resurrection and judgement stead between the hands of the lord of dread; and remember that to one of two houses thou art sped, either for heavens eterne or to the hell fires that burn.' thereupon the old woman sat down beside the damsels. now when thy father, who hath found mercy, heard their discourse, he knew that they were the most accomplished of the people of their time; and, seeing their beauty and loveliness and the extent of their wisdom and lore, he showed them all favour. moreover, he turned to the ancient dame and treated her with honour, and set apart for her and her damsels the palace which had lodged princess abrizah, daughter of the king of greece, to which he bade carry all the luxuries they needed. they abode with him ten days and the old woman abode with them; and, whenever the king visited them, he found her absorbed in prayer, watching by night and fasting by day; whereby love of her took hold upon his heart and he said to me, 'o wazir, verily this old woman is of the pious, and awe of her is strong in my heart.' now on the eleventh day, the king visited her, that he might pay her the price of the damsels; but she said to him, 'o king, know that the price of these maidens surpasseth the competence of men; indeed i seek not for them either gold or silver or jewels, be it little or much.' now when thy father heard these words he wondered and asked her, 'o my lady and what is their price?'; whereto she answered, 'i will not sill them to thee save on condition that thou fast, watching by night a whole month, and abstaining by day, all for the love of allah almighty; and, if thou do this, they are thy property to use in thy palace as thou please.' so the king wondered at the perfection of her rectitude and piety and abnegation; she was magnified in his eyes and he said, 'allah make this pious woman to profit us!' then he agreed with her to fast for a month as she had stipulated, and she said to him, 'i will help thee with the prayers i pray for thee and now bring me a gugglet of water.' they brought one and she took it and recited over it and muttered spells, and sat for an hour speaking in speech no one understood or knew aught thereof. lastly she covered it with a cloth and, sealing it with her signet ring, gave it to thy sire, saying, 'when thou hast fasted the first ten days, break thy fast on the eleventh night with what is in this gugglet, for it will root out the love of the world from thy heart and fill it with light and faith. as for me, tomorrow i will go forth to my brethren, the invisible  controuls, for i yearn after them, and i will return to thee when the first ten days are past. thy father took the gugglet and arose and set it apart in a closet of his palace, then locked the door and put the key in his pocket. next day the king fasted and the old woman went her ways.""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the eighty-fifth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the wazir dandan thus continued to zau al-makan, ""now when came the day for the sultan's fast, the old woman went her ways. and after he had accomplished the ten days thereof, on the eleventh he opened the gugglet and drank what was therein and found it cordial to his stomach. within the second ten days of the month the old woman returned, bringing sweetmeats wrapped in a green leaf, like no leaf of known tree. she went in to thy sire and saluted him; and, when he saw her, he rose to her saying, 'welcome, o pious lady!' 'o king,' quoth she, 'the invisible controuls salute thee, for i told them of thee, and they rejoiced in thee and have sent thee their halwá,  which is of the sweetmeats of the other world. do thou break thy fast on it at the end of the day.' the king rejoiced at this with great joy, and exclaimed, 'praised be allah, who hath given me brethren of the invisible world!' thereupon he thanked the ancient dame and kissed her hands; and he honoured her and the damsels with exceeding honour. she went forth for the twenty days of thy father's fast at the end of which time she came to him and said, 'know, o king, that i told the invisible controuls of the love which is between me and thee, and informed them how i had left the maidens with thee, and they were glad that the damsels should belong to a king like thee; for they were wont, when they saw them, to be strenuous in offering on their behalf prayers and petitions ever granted. so i would fain carry them to the invisible controuls that they may benefit by the breath of their favour, and peradventure, they shall not return to thee without some treasure of the treasures of the earth, that thou, after completing thy fast, mayst occupy thyself with their raiment and help thyself by the money they shall bring thee, to the extent of thy desires.' when thy sire heard her words, he thanked her for them and said, 'except that i fear to cross thee, i would not accept the treasure or aught else; but when wilt thou set out with them?' replied she, 'on the seven and twentieth night; and i will bring them back to thee at the head of the month, by which time thou wilt have accomplished thy fast and they will have had their courses and be free from impurity; and they shall become thine and be at thy disposal. by allah, each damsel of them is worth many times thy kingdom!' he said, 'i know it, o pious lady!' then quoth the old woman, 'there is no help but that thou send with them someone in thy palace who is dear to thee, that she may find solace and seek a blessing of the invisible controuls.' quoth he, 'i have a greek slave called sophia, by whom i have been blessed with two children, a girl and a boy; but they were lost; years ago. take her with thee that she may get the blessing'""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the eighty-sixth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the wazir dandan continued to zau al-makan, ""quoth thy sire to the ancient woman when she demanded the handmaids of him, 'i have a greek slave called sophia, by whom i have been blest with two children, a girl and a boy, but they were lost years ago; so take her with thee, haply she may get the benediction and, belike, the invisible controuls will sue allah for her that her two children may be restored to her.' 'thou hast said well,' replied she; 'for that indeed was her grievousest want.' thy sire gave not over finishing his fast till the old woman said to him, 'o my son, i am going to the invisible controuls; so bring me sophia.' accordingly, he summoned her and she came forthright, and he delivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the other damsels. then she went in to her chamber and bringing out a sealed cup, presented it to the sultan saying, 'on the thirtieth day, do thou repair to the hammam and when thou comest out, enter one of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup. then sleep, and thou shalt attain what thou seekest, and peace be with thee'! thereat the king was glad and thanked her and kissed her hands. quoth she, 'i commend thee to allah's care;' whereat quoth he, 'and when shall i see thee again, o pious lady? in very sooth i love not to part with thee.' then she called down blessings on him and departed with the five damsels and the queen; whilst the king fasted after her departure other three days, till the month ended, when he arose and went to the hammam and coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace, commanding that none should go in to him. there, after making fast the door, he drank what was in the cup and lay down to sleep; and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day, but he did not come out and we said, 'perchance he is tired with the bath and with watching by night and fasting by day; wherefore he sleepeth.' so we waited till next day; but still he did not come forth. then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haply he might awake and ask what was the matter. but nothing came of that; so at last we lifted up the door;  and, going in, found him dead, with his flesh torn into strips and bits and his bones broken.  when we saw him in this condition it was grievous to us, and we took up the cup and found within its cover a piece of paper whereon was inscribed, 'whoso doeth evil leaveth no regrets, and this be the reward of him who playeth traitor with the daughters of kings and who debaucheth them; and we make known to all who fall upon this scroll that sharrkan, when he came to our country, seduced our queen abrizah; nor did that suffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her to you. then he  sent her away in company of a black slave who slew her, and we found her lying dead on the desert sward and thrown out to wild beasts. this be no kingly deed, and he who did this is requited with naught but what he merited. so do ye suspect none of having killed him, for no one slew him but the cunning witch, whose name is zat al-dawahi. and behold, i have taken the king's wife, sophia, and have carried her to her father, afridun king of constantinople. moreover, there is no help for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and take your country from you, and ye shall be cut off even to the last man, nor shall a living soul be spared by death nor one who bloweth fire with his breath, save he who cross and belt  worshippeth.' when we read this paper, we knew that the ancient woman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us: whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sore when weeping availed us naught. and the troops fell out as to whom they should make sultan; some would have thee, and others would have thy brother sharrkan; and we ceased not to dispute about this for the space of a month, at the end of which certain of us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother sharrkan: so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee. and such is the manner of the death of sultan omar bin al-nu'uman!"" now when the wazir dandan had made an end of his story, zau al- makan and his sister, nuzhat al-zaman wept; and the chamberlain, who wept also, said to zau al-makan, ""o king, weeping will avail thee naught; nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thy heart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty; for verily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead."" thereupon zau al-makan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set up without the pavilion, and then commanded the army to pass in review order before him. and the chamberlain sat by his side and all the armour-bearers  behind him, whilst the wazir dandan and the rest of the emirs and grandees stood each in his individual stead. then quoth king zau al-makan to the minister dandan, ""inform me concerning my sire's treasures;"" and he replied, ""i hear and i obey;"" and gave him to know of the late king's hoards and monies, and what was in the treasury of amassed wealth and jewels, and acquainted him with other precious things. so zau al-makan opened his hand to the army, and gave a sumptuous robe of honour to the wazir dandan, saying, ""thou continues"" in office. whereupon dandan kissed the ground before him and wished him long life. then he bestowed dresses on the emirs, after which he said to the chamberlain, ""bring out before me the tribute of damascus that is with thee."" so he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, when he took them and parted them all amongst the troops,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the eighty-seventh night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that zau al- makan ordered the chamberlain to bring out before him what he had brought of the tribute of damascus; and, when he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, he took them and parted them all amongst the troops, till nothing was left. and the emirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life, saying, ""never saw we a king, who gave the like of these gifts."" then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gave orders for marching. so they marched for three days, till, on the fourth day, they drew near to baghdad. when they entered the city, they found it decorated, and zau al-makan, the sultan, went up to his father's palace and sat down on the throne, whilst the emirs of the army and the wazir dandan and the chamberlain of damascus stood between his hands. then he bade his private secretary write a writ to his brother sharrkan, acquainting him with all that had passed, from first to last, and he concluded, ""as soon as thou hast read this letter, make ready thine affair and join us with thine army, that we may turn to holy war upon the infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out the stain upon our honour."" then he folded the letter and sealed it with his seal ring and said to the minister dandan, ""none shall carry this letter but thou; and it behoveth thee speak my brother fair and say to him, 'if thou have a mind to thy father's kingdom, it is thine, and thy brother shall be viceroy for thee in damascus; for to this effect am i instructed by him.'"" so the wazir went down from before him and made ready for his march. then zau al-makan bade set apart a magnificent house for the fireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long is the tale of that fireman.  presently zau al-makan went out chasing and hunting and, as he was returning to baghdad, one of the emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteous handmaids whose description the tongue evades. one of the damsels pleased him: so he went in unto her and knew her that night, and she conceived by him forthright. after a while, the wazir dandan returned from his journey, bringing him news of his brother sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him, and said, ""it were fitting thou go forth to meet him."" zau al- makan replied, ""i hear and i consent;"" and riding forth with his grandees a day's journey from baghdad, he pitched his pavilions there awaiting his brother. next morning appeared king sharrkan amid the army of syria, a horseman of might, a lion fierce in fight, a prow and doughty knight. as the squadrons drew nigh and the dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with banners on high, zau al-makan and those with him pushed forward to meet sharrkan and his men; and when zau al-makan saw his brother, he desired to dismount, but sharrkan conjured him not to do on this wise, and himself footed it, and walked a few paces towards him.  as soon as he reached zau al-makan, the new sultan threw himself upon him, and sharrkan embraced him and wept with great weeping and the twain condoled with each other. then they mounted and rode onward, they and their troops, till they reached baghdad, where they alighted and went up to the royal palace and there they passed that night, and when next morning came, zau al- makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts, and proclaimed a holy war and a razzia.  they then awaited the coming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom, and every one who came they entreated with honour and promised him all manner of good; till in so doing a full month had sped, and the fighting men flocked to them in a continuous body. then sharrkan said to zau al-makan, ""o my brother, tell me thy history."" so he told him all that had befallen him from first to last, including the benevolent dealing of the fireman with him. asked sharrkan, 'hast thou requited his kindness?""; and he answered, ""o my brother! i have not rewarded him as yet, but inshallah! i will recompense him whenas i return from this raid""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the eighty-eighth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that sharrkan asked his brother zau al-makan, ""hast thou requited the fireman for his kindness?""; and he answered, ""o my brother, i have not rewarded him as yet, but inshallah! i will recompense him whenas i return from this raid and find time so to do."" therewith sharrkan was certified that his sister, nuzhat al-zaman, had told him the whole truth; but he concealed what had passed between them and offered his salutation to her by her husband the chamberlain. she sent him back her greeting, calling down blessings on him and enquiring after her daughter kuzia-fakan, to which he replied that the maiden was well and in the best of health and safety. where upon she praised almighty allah and gave him thanks. then sharrkan went to his brother to take counsel with him for departure; and zau al-makan said, ""o my brother, as soon as the army is complete and the arabs have come in from all parts, we will march forth."" so he bade make ready the commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to his wife, who was now five months gone with child; and he put under her astrologers and mathematicians, to whom he appointed stipends and allowances. then he set out three months after the arrival of the army of syria, and as soon as the arabs were come in and the troops were assembled from all directions; and, as he fared forth, he was followed by the warriors and the united host. now the name of the general of the daylam army was rustam and that of the general of the army of the turks  bahram. and zau al- makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brother sharrkan, and on his left the chamberlain his brother-in-law. so the squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions and companies filed past in battle array, till the whole army was in motion. they ceased not to fare on for the space of a month, and each body dismounted at its own ground and there rested every week three days (for the host was great); and they advanced in this order till they came to the country of the greeks. then the people of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort took fright at them and fled to constantinople. but when king afridun heard the tidings he arose and betook himself to zat al-dawahi, the same who had contrived the stratagem, and had travelled to baghdad and had slain king omar bin al-nu'uman; and who after carrying off her slaves and queen sophia, had returned with them all to her native land. now when she had been restored to her son, the king of greece, and felt herself safe, she said to king hardub, ""cool thine eyes; for i have avenged by blood the shame of thy daughter abrizah, and have killed omar bin al-nu'uman and have brought back sophia. so now let us go to the king of constantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint him with what hath happened, that all of us be on guard and prepare our forces; and i will fare with thee to king afridun, lord of constantinople, for i opine that the moslems will not await our attack."" said hardub, ""tarry thou till they draw near our country, that we may make us ready meantime and assemble our power."" accordingly they took to levying their forces and preparing for war, and, when the news of the moslems' advance reached them, they were prepared for defence; and zat al dawahi had preceded them. now when she and her son arrived at constantinople, the king of kings, afridun, hearing of the approach of hardub, king of the greeks, came forth to meet him and asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit. so hardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother, zat al-dawahi, how she had slain the moslem king and recovered from him queen sophia, and had said, ""the moslems have assembled their forces and are on their way to attack us, wherefore it behoveth that we two join hands in single band and meet them."" now king afridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing of king omar bin al-nu'uman; and he sent to all countries seeking succour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying the moslem king. so the nazarene troops flocked to him and three months were not past ere the army of the greeks was complete, besides which there joined themselves to him franks from all their lands, french, germans  and ragusans,  with men of zara,  venetians, genoese, and all the hosts of the yellow faces ; and, when the gathering was at its full, earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude. then afridun, the great king, ordered a march; so they set out and ceased not to defile through the city for ten days. they fared on till they reached the wady highs al-nu'uman, a broad sided vale hard by the salt sea, where they halted three days; and on the fourth they were about to set out again, when news came that the army of al-islam on them press, and the defenders of the faith of mohammed, of men the best. so they halted in it other three days, and on the eighth they espied a dust cloud which towered till it walled the whole land; nor was an hour of the day past ere that dust began to drift and was torn to shreds in the lift, and pierced through its shades the starry radiance of lance and the white levee of blades. presently there appeared beneath it the banners islamitan and the ensigns mahometan; the horsemen urged forward, like the letting loose of seas that surged, clad in mail, as they were mackerel-back clouds which the moon enveil; whereupon the two hosts clashed, like two torrents on each other dashed. eyes fell upon eyes; and the first to seek combat singular was the wazir dandan, he and the army of syria, numbering thirty thousand bridles, and with him were the general of the turks, and the general of daylam, rustam and bahram, amid twenty thousand horse, behind whom came the men from the shores of the salt sea, clad in iron mail, as they were full moons that past through a night o'ercast. then the nazarene host called out on jesus and mary, and the defiled  cross and they heaped themselves upon the wazir dandan and those with him of the syrian host. now all this was in pursuance of a stratagem devised by that ancient woman zat al-dawahi; for, before his departure, king afridun had gone in to her and asked her, ""how shall i do and what plan shall i pursue?; it is thou hast caused this great distress to us;"" and she had answered, ""o great king and mighty cohen!  i will teach thee a trick would baffle iblis himself, though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts.""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the eighty-ninth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, all this was a stratagem of the ancient woman, for that the king before his departure had gone to her and asked, ""how shall i do and what plan shall i pursue? it is thou hast caused this great distress to us!"" and she had answered, ""o great king and mighty cohen, i will teach thee a trick would baffle the devil himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts. it is that thou send fifty thousand men going down in ships, and sailing over the sea to the mountain of smoke; and there let them land and stir not till {he standards of al-islam come upon thee, when do thou up and at them. then bid the troops from the seaward sally out upon the moslems and take them in rear, whilst we confront them from the landward. so not one of them shall escape, and our sorrows shall tease and peace abide with us."" now the counsel of this ancient woman commended itself to king afridun, and he replied, ""right is the recking thou reckest, o princess of wits and recourse of kings and cohens warring for their blood wit!"" so when the army of al-islam came upon them in chat valley, before they knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and the swords in men's bodies to make rents. then hurried up the army of baghdad and khorasan who numbered one hundred and twenty thousand horse, with zau al-makan in the front of war. when the host of the infidels that lay by the sea saw them, they sallied out against them and followed in their tracks; and when zau al- makan espied this he cried out to his men, ""turn back to the infidels, o people of the chosen apostle, and slay those who deny and hate the authority of the compassionating, the compassionate!"" so they turned and fought with the christians. then sharrkan marched up with another corps of the moslem host, some hundred thousand men, whilst the infidels numbered nigh upon a thousand and six hundred thousand men. when the moslems were united, their hearts were strengthened and they cried out, saying, ""verily allah hath pro mised us victory, and to the infidels hath assigned defeat."" and they clashed together with sword and spear. now sharrkan tare through rank and row and raged among the masses of the foe, fighting so fierce a fight as to make children grey grow; nor did he cease tourneying among the infidel horde and working havoc among them with the keen edged sword, shouting ""allaho akbar!"" (allah is most great) till he drove back the host to the coast. then failed the force of the foe and allah gave victory to the faith of al-islam, and folk fought folk, drunken without strong drink till they slew of the infidels in this affair forty and five thousand, while of the moslems but three thousand and five hundred fell. moreover, the lion of the faith, king sharrkan, and his brother, zau al-makan, slept not that night, but occupied themselves with congratulating their braves and with looking to the wounded and with assuring the army of victory and salvation and promise of reward in the world to come. thus far concerning the moslem; but as regards king afridun, lord of constantinople and sovran of roum, and zat al-dawahi, they assembled the emirs of the host and said to them, ""verily, we had worked our will and solaced our hearts, but our over confidence in our numbers, and that only, defeated us."" then quoth to them the ancient one, the lady of calamities, ""in very sooth nought shall profit you, except ye draw you nigh unto the messiah and put your trust in the true belief, for, by the virtue of the messiah, the whole strength of the moslem host lieth in that satan, king sharrkan."" ""tomorrow,"" said king afridun, ""i have resolved to draw up in battle array and to send out against them that redoubtable cavalier, lúká bin shamlút; for if king sharrkan come forth as a champion to fight single handed, our man will slay him and will slay the other moslem knights, till not one is left. and i purpose this night to sacre you all with the holy incense."" when the emirs heard these words they kissed the ground before him. now the incense which he designated was the excrement of the chief patriarch, the denier, the defiler of the truth, and they sought for it with such instance, and they so highly valued it that the high priests of the greeks used to send it to all the countries of the christians in silken wraps after mixing it with musk and ambergris. hearing of it kings would pay a thousand gold pieces for every dram and they sent for and sought it to fumigate brides withal; and the chief priests and the great kings were wont to use a little of it as collyrium for the eyes and as a remedy in sickness and colic; and the patriarchs used to mix their own skite  with it, for that the skite of the chief patriarch could not suffice for ten countries.  so, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen, and king afridun,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the ninetieth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and king afridun summoned his chief knights and nobles and invested them with dresses of honour; and, drawing the sign of the cross on their brows, incensed them with the incense which as aforesaid was the skite of the chief patriarch, the cohen, the heresiarch. this incensing done, he called for luka bin shamlut, surnamed the sword of the messiah; and, after fumigating him and rubbing his palate with the holy merde, caused him to snuff it and smeared his cheeks and anointed his moustaches with the rest. now there was no stouter champion in the land of roum than this accursed luka, nor any better at bending of bow or sway of sword or lunge with lance on the day of devoir; but he was foul of favour, for his face was as the face of an ass, his shape that of an ape and his look as the look of a malignant snake: his presence was grievouser than parting from the beloved make; and blacker than night was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was his breath for foulness; more crooked than a bow was his crookedness and grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness, and he was branded with the mark of the infidels on face.  after this he came up to king afridun and kissed his feet and stood before him; and the king said to him, ""i desire thou go out against sharrkan, king of damascus, son of omar bin al-nu'uman, and deliver us from this affliction."" quoth luka, ""hearkening and obedience;"" and the king made the sign of the cross on his forehead and felt assured of help from heaven being near hand. then luka went out from the presence and the accursed one mounted a sorrel horse; he was clad in a red robe and a hauberk of gold set with jewels, and he bore a trident spear, as he were iblis the damned on the day of drewing out his hosts war to darraign. then he rode forward, he and his horde of infidels, even as though they were driving to the fire, preceded by a herald, crying aloud in the arabic tongue and saying, ""ho, sect of mohammed (upon whom be salutation and salvation!), let none of you come out but your champion sharrkan, the sword of al-islam, lord of damascus in shám !"" nor had he made an end of speaking, when arose a tumult in the plain; all the people heard the strain and the whole moving bodies of the armies twain called to mind the day of complain. then the cowards trembled and all necks turned towards the sound, and lo! it was king sharrkan, son of king omar bin al-nu'uman. for when his brother, zau al-makan, saw that accursed one push out on the plain, and heard the pursuivant, he turned to sharrkan and said to him, ""of a surety they seek for thee."" said he, ""should it so be, 'twere most pleasing to me."" so when they made sure of the matter and heard the herald crying in the plain, ""let none of you come out against me save sharrkan,"" they knew this cursed luka to be champion of the land of roum who had sworn to sweep the earth clean of moslems. now he was one of the greatest of villains, a wretch who caused hearts to pain; and the dayiamites, turks and kurds dreaded his might and main. presently sharrkan crave at him like a lion angry grim, mounted on a courser like a wild gazelle flying snell and slim; and coming nigh to him made the spear he hent to shake as it were a darting snake, and recited these couplets,  ""i have a sorrel steed, whose pride is fain to bear the rein, *              shall give thee what thou likest not and make thee feel his              main: i have a handy limber spear full bright and keen of point, * upon              whose shaft the dam of death her throny seat hath ta'en: i have a trenchant glaive of hind; and, when i bare its face * of              scabbard"" veil, from out its brow the rays of levee rain.""  luka understood not the sense of his speech nor did he apprehend the vehemence of the verse; but he smote his forehead with his hand, in honour of the cross drawn thereon and kissed it; then he couched his throw spear and ran at sharrkan. but first he tossed the javelin with one hand in air to such height that it was lost to the spectators' sight; and, catching it with the other hand as do the jugglers, hurled it at sharrkan. it flew from his grasp like a shooting star and folk clamoured and feared for sharrkan; but, as the spear flew near him, he put out his hand and caught it in full flight to the amazement of all who saw the sight. then he shook it with the hand that took it till it was well nigh broken, and hurled it so high into the welkin that it disappeared from view. as it descended, he caught it again with the other hand, in less than the twinkling of an eye, and cried out from his heart core, saying, ""by the truth of him who created the sevenfold skies, i will assuredly make this cursed wight a byword for mankind to despise!"" then threw he the throw spear at luka, who thought to do as sharrkan had done and put forth his hand to trend it in mid flight; but sharrkan prevented him, and sped at him a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell on his forehead, in the very centre of the sign of the cross, and allah hurried his soul to the fire and dwelling place dire.  but when the infidels saw luka bin shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and they cried, ""alas!"" and ""woe worth the day!"" and called for aid upon the abbots of the monasteries,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the ninety-first night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the infidels saw luka bin shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and cried, ""alas!"" and ""woe worth the day!"" and called upon the abbots of the monasteries and cried, ""where be the crosses?"" so the religious offered up prayers and the christians all drew together against sharrkan; and, brandishing their scymitars and lances, rushed forward to the attack. then army met army and breasts fell under hoof, whilst spear and sword ruled the day and forearms and wrists grew weak and the coursers seemed created without legs;  nor did the herald of-war cease calling to fight, till arms were aweary and day took flight and night came on with darkness dight. so the two hosts drew apart, whilst every brave staggered like a drunken knave, for that with so much cut and thrust they strave; and the place was choked with the slain; fell were the wounds and the hurt knew not by whom they fell. then sharrkan joined his brother, zau al-makan, and the chamberlain and the wazir dandan, and said to them, ""verily allah hath opened a door for the infidels to fall, praised be the lord of the worlds one and all!"" replied zau al-makan, ""let us never cease to praise allah, for that he hath dispelled trouble from the arab and the ajam. indeed the folk, generation after generation, shall tell of thy derring do against the accursed luka, the falsifier of the evangel;  of thy catching the throng spear in mid-flight, and how the enemy of allah among men thou didst smite; and thy fame shall endure until the end of time."" then said sharrkan, ""harkye, o grand chamberlain and doughty capitayne!"" and he answered, ""adsum!""  quoth sharrkan, ""take with thee the wazir dandan and twenty thousand horse, and lead them seven parasangs towards the sea, and force the march till ye shall have come near the shore, and there remain only two parasangs between thee and the foe. then ambush ye in the hollows of the ground till ye hear the tumult of the infidels disembarking from their ships; and the war cry from every side strike your ear and ye know that the sabres have begun labour between us and them; and, whenso ye see our troops falling back, as if defeated, and all the infidels following them, as well those in front as those from the seaward and the tents, do ye still lie in wait for them: but as soon as ye see the standard with the words, there is no god but the god, and mohammed is god's apostle (on whom be salutation and salvation!), then up with the green banner, and do your endeavour and fall on their rear and shout, 'alla ho akbar! allah is most great!' and circle round that they may not interpose between the retreating army and the sea."" he replied, ""to hear is to obey!""; and forthright they agreed upon this matter and they went forth. now the chamberlain took with himself the wazir dandan and twenty thousand men even as sharrkan had commanded. as soon as dawned the morn, the troops sprung to horse when they had donned their armour gear and drawn the scymitar and slung the spear. then the christians dispread themselves over hill and dale and the ecclesiasts  cried out and all heads were bared, and those in the ships hoisted the cross at their mast heads and began making for shore from every side, and landed their horses and get them ready for fight and fray, whilst the sword blades glittered bright and the javelins glanced like levee light on mail shirt white; and all joined fight and the grind mill of death whirled round and ground those who fought from horse and aground: heads from bodies flew end tongues mute grew and eyes no vision knew. scymitars strave with utmost strain and heads flew over the battle plain; gall bladders crave and wrists were shorn in twain; steeds plashed in pools of gore and beards were gripped right sore; the host of al-islam called out, saying, ""on the prince of mankind be blessings and peace, and to the compassionate glory and praise, which ne'er shall cease, for his boons which aye increase;"" and the host of the infidels shouted, ""glory to the cross and the belt and the vine press juice, and the wine presser and the priests and the monks and the festival of palms and the metropolitan!"" now zau al-makan and sharrkan held back and their troops gave way and feigned flight from before the enemy, while the infidel array pressed hard upon them deeming them in rout, and made ready to foin and hew. then the meiny of the moslems raised their voices, reciting the first verses of the chapter of the cow,  whilst the dead were trampled under hoofs of steeds, and the heralds of the greeks cried out, ""ho, servants of the messiah! ho, people of the true faith! ho, followers of the primate!  verily divine grace upon you opes; for see, the hosts of al islam like birds with broken wings incline to elope! so turn ye not to them your backs, but let your swords cleave deep in their necks and hold not your hands from them, else are ye outcasts from the messiah, mary's son, who spoke even when a cradled one!""  now afridun, king of constantinople, deemed that the infidels were victorious, knowing not that this was but a clever stratagem of the moslems, and sent to king hardub of roum congratulations on success, adding, ""availed us naught but the holy merde of the arch patriarch, whose fragrance exhaled from the beards and mustachios of the slaves of the cross near and far; and i swear, by the miracles of the messiah; and by thy daughter abrizah, the nazarene, the mariolater; and by the waters of baptism, that i will not leave upon the earth a single defender of al- islam! and to the bitter end will i carry out this plan."" so the messenger betook himself with the address to king hardub, whilst the infidels called to one another saying, ""take we vengeance wreak for luka!""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the ninety-second night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the infidels called to one another, saying, ""take we vengeance wreak for luka!"" while hardub king of greece cried aloud, ""ho, to our revenge for abrizah!"" thereupon king zau al-makan shouted ""ho, servants of the requiting king!: smite the children of denial and disobedience with the blanch of sword and the brown of spear!"" so the moslems returned to the infidels and plied them with the keen edged scymitar, whilst their herald cried aloud, ""up, and at the foes of the faith, all ye who love the prophet elect, with hope of salvation on the day of fear, to win favour of the bountiful, the forgiving one; for verily the garden of paradise is under the shadow of swords!"" and behold, sharrkan and his men charged down upon the infidels and cut off their retreat and wheeled and tourneyed among the ranks; when lo! a knight of goodly presence opened a passage through the army of unbelievers and circled hither and thither amongst the deniers, cutting and thrusting and covering the ground with heads and trunks, so that the faithless feared him and their necks bent under his lunge and hew. he was girt with two swords, his glances and his brand, and he was armed with two lances, one of bamboo cane and the other his straight wand like shape; and his flowing hair stood him in stead of many warriors, even as saith the poet,  ""laud not long hair,  except it be dispread * in two fold             locks, on day of fight and fray, o'er youth who bears his lance 'twixt flank and thigh, * from              many a whis kered knight to win the day."" and as singeth another,  ""i say to him, what while he slings his sword, * 'for sword shall              serve those looks that sword like show!' says he, 'my sabre looks for those i love, * my sword for those              who sweets of love unknow!'""  when sharrkan saw him, he said to him, ""i conjure thee by the koran and the attributes of the compassionate one, o champion of the champions! tell me who thou art: for verily by thy deeds this day thou hast pleased the requiting king, whom one thing distracteth not from other thing; in that thou hast been discomforting the children of impiety and in rebellion revelling."" then cried the cavalier to him saying, ""thou art he who madest brother covenant with me but yesterday: how quickly thou hast forgotten me!"" thereupon he withdrew his mouth veil,  so that what was hidden of his beauty was disclosed, and lo! it was none other than zau al-makan. then sharrkan rejoiced in his brother, save that he feared for him the rush of fighting and the crush of braves a smiting; and this for two reasons, the first, his tender age and exposure to the evil eye, and the second, that his safety was to the kingdom the greater of the two overshadowing wings. so he said to him, ""o king! thou riskest thy life, so join thy steed to mine; in very sooth i fear for thee from the foe; and better thou stint hazarding thyself forth of these squadrons, that we may shoot at the enemy thine unerring shaft."" quoth zau al-makan, ""i desire to even thee in fray and i will not be niggard of myself before thee in the melay."" then the host of al-islam, heaping itself upon the infidels, girt them on all sides, warred on them a right holy war, and brake the power of the children of impiety and pride and stowre. but king afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak that had fallen on the greek, and they turned their backs from fight and addressed themselves to flight, making for the ships, when lo! there came out upon them from the seacoast another host, led by the minister dandan, the champion who was wont to make champions bite the dust, and to lay load on them with cut and thrust. nor less came forth the emir bahram, lord of the provinces of sham, amid twenty thousand horse doughty of arm; and the host of al-islam pressed them in front and on flank and wrought them grievous harm. then a body of the moslems turned against those who in the ships remained, and perdition on them rained, till they threw themselves into the main, and they slew of them many slain, more than a hundred thousand noblemen, nor was one of their champions, great or small, saved from bale and bane. moreover, they took their ships, with all the money and treasure and cargo, save a score of keel, and the moslems got that loot whose like was never gotten in by gone years; nor was such cut and thrust ever heard of by men's ears.  now amongst the booty were fifty thousand horses, besides treasure and spoil past reckoning and arithmetic, whereat the moslems rejoiced with an exceeding joy for that allah had given them victory and protection. such was the case with them; but as regards the fugitive infidels they soon reached constantinople, whither the tidings preceded them that king afridun had prevailed over the moslems; so quoth the ancient dame, zat al-dawahi, ""i know that my son hardub, king of roum, is no runagate and that he feareth not the islamitic hosts, but will restore the whole world to the nazarene faith."" then she bade the great king, afridun, give command that the city be decorated, and the people held festival high and drank their wines drunkenly and knew not the decrees of destiny. now whilst they were in the midst of their rejoicings, behold, the raven of dule and downfall croaked over them, and up came the twenty fugitive ships wherein was the king of cæsarea. so king afridun, lord of constantinople, met them on the sea shore, and they told him all that had befallen them from the moslem, and they wept sore and groaned and moaned; and rejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal; and they informed him concerning luka son of shamlut, how calamity had betided him and how death had shot him with his shaft. thereat the horrors of doomday rose upon king afridun,  and he knew that there was no making straight their crook. then came up from them the sound of weeping and wailing; the city was full of men mourning and the keepers were keening, and sighs and cries were heard from all sides. and when king hardub of greece met king afridun he told him the truth of the case and how the flight of the moslems was by way of stratagem and deceit, and said to him, ""look not to see any of the army, save those who have already reached thee."" when king afridun heard these words he fell down in a fainting fit, with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, he exclaimed, ""surely the messiah was wroth with them that he caused the moslems to prevail over them!"" then came the arch patriarch sadly to the king who said to him, ""o our father, annihilation hath overtaken our army and the messiah hath punished us!"" replied the patriarch, ""grieve not nor feel concerned, for it cannot be but that one of you have sinned against the messiah, and all have been punished for his offence; but now we will read prayers for you in the churches, that the mohammeden hosts may be repelled from you."" after which the old woman, zat al-dawahi, came to afridun and said to him, ""o king, verily the moslem hosts are many, and we shall never overcome them save by wile: wherefore i purpose to work upon them by guile and repair to this army of al-islam, haply i may win my wish of their leader and slay their champion, even as i slew his father. if my stratagem succeed in his case, not one of the host he leads shall return to his native land, for all are strong only because of him; but i desire to have some christian dwellers of syria, such as go out every month and year to sell their goods, that they may help me (for this they can do) in carrying out my plan."" replied the king, ""be it so whenever thou wilt."" so she bade fetch an hundred men, natives of najrán,  in sham, and the king asked them, ""have ye not heard what hath befallen the christians with the moslems?"" ""yes,"" answered they; and he rejoined, ""know ye that this woman hath devoted her life to the messiah and purposeth to go forth with you, disguised as monotheists and mohammedans, to work out a device which shall profit us and hinder the moslem from us: say, then, are ye also willing to devote yourselves to the anointed and i will give you a quintal of gold?  he of you who escapeth shall have the money, and him of you who dieth will the messiah reward."" ""o king,"" replied they, ""we will devote our lives to the messiah, and we will be thy sacrifice."" thereupon the old woman took all she required of aromatic roots and placed them in water which she boiled over the fire till the black essence of them was extracted. she waited till the decoction was cold, then dipped the corner of a long kerchief therein and stained her face therewith. moreover, she donned over her clothes a long gaberdine with an embroidered border and took in her hand a rosary, and afterwards went in to king afridun, who knew her not, nor did any of his companions know her, till she discovered herself to them: and there was none in the assembly but who thanked and praised her for her cunning; and her son rejoiced and said, ""may the messiah never fail thee!"" thereupon she took with her the syrian christians, and set out for the army of baghdad.— and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the ninety-third night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when king afridun heard these words, he fell into a fainting fit with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, fear fluttered the scrotum  below his belly and he complained to the ancient dame, zat al-dawahi. now this accursed old woman was a witch of the witches, past mistress in sorcery and deception; wanton and wily, deboshed and deceptious; with foul breath, red eyelids, yellow cheeks, dull brown face, eyes bleared, mangy body, hair grizzled, back humped, skin withered and wan and nostrils which ever ran. but she had studied the scriptures of al-islam and had made the pilgrimage to the holy house of meccah and all this that she might come to the knowledge of the mohammedan ordinances and the miraculous versets of the koran; and she had professed judaism in the holy city of jerusalem  for two years' space, that she might master the magic of men and demons; so that she was a plague of plagues and a pest of pests, wrong headed as to belief and to no religion fief. now the chief reason of her sojourn with her son, king hardub of greece, was on account of the slave virgins at his court: for she was given to tribadism  and could not exist without sapphism or she went mad: so if any damsel pleased her, she was wont to teach her the art of rubbing clitoris against clitoris and would anoint her with saffron  till she fainted away for excess of volupty. whoso obeyed her she was wont to favour and make her son incline towards her; but whoso repelled her she would contrive to destroy; and so she abode for a length of time. this was known to marjanah and rayhánah and utrijah, the handmaids of abrizah, and their princess loathed the old woman and abhorred to lie with her, because of the rank smell from her armpits, the stench of her fizzles more fetid than carrion, and the roughness of her hide coarser than palm fibre. she was wont to bribe those who rubbed parts with her by means of jewels and instructions; but abrizah held aloof from her and sought refuge with the omnipotent, the omniscient; for, by allah, right well quoth the poet,  ""ho thou who grovellest low before the great * nor over fording              lesser men dost blench who gildest dross by dirham gathering, * no otter scent disguises              carrion stench!  and now to return to the story of her stratagem and the woes of her working. presently she departed, taking the chief nazarenes with their hosts, and turned towards the army of the moslems. whereupon king hardub went in to king afridun and said to him, ""o king, we have no need of the chief patriarch nor of his prayers, but will consult my mother's counsel and observe what she will do with her craft unending against the moslem hosts; for these are marching with all their power, they will soon be upon us and they will encircle us on all sides."" when king afridun heard this, terror took hold upon his heart and he wrote letters, without stay or delay, to all the nations of the nazarenes, saying, ""it behoveth none of the messiahites or cross knights to hold back, especially the folk of the strongholds and forts: but let them all come to us, foot and horse, women and children, for the moslem hosts already tread our soil. so haste! haste ye! ere what we fear to us here appear."" thus much concerning them; but regarding the work of the old woman, zat al-dawahi; when she went forth from the city with her suite, she clad them in the clothing of moslem merchants, having provided herself with an hundred mules carrying stuffs of antioch, such as goldwoven satins and royal brocades and so forth. and she had taken a letter from king afridun to the following effect: ""these be merchantmen from the land of sham who have been with us: so it besitteth none to do them harm or hindrance, nor take tax and tithe of them, till they reach their homes and safe places, for by merchants a country flourisheth, and these are no men of war nor of ill faith."" then quoth the accursed zat al-dawahi to those with her, ""verily i wish to work out a plot for the destruction of the moslem."" replied they, ""o queen, command us whatso thou wilt; we are at thy disposal and may the messiah never disappoint thy dealings!"" then she donned a gown of fine white wool and rubbed her forehead, till she made a great mark as of a scar and anointed it with an ointment of her own fashion, so that it shone with prodigious sheen. now the old hag was lean bodied and hollow eyed, and she bound her legs tightly round with cords  just above her feet, till she drew near the moslem camp, when she unwound them, leaving their marks deeply embedded in her ankles. then she anointed the wheels with dragon's blood and bade her companions beat her with a severe beating, and set her in a chest and, quoth she, ""cry abroad the refrain of unity,  nor fear from it aught of damage!"" replied they, ""how can we beat thee, who be our sovereign lady, zat al-dawahi, mother of the king we glory in?"" then said she, ""we blame not nor deal reproach to him who goeth to the jakes, and in need evil becometh good deed. when ye have set me in the chest, take it and make it one of the bales and place it on mule back and fare forth with it and the other goods through the moslem camp, and fear ye no blame. and if any of the moslems hinder you, give up the mules and their lading and be take yourselves to their king, zau al-makan, and implore his protection saying, 'we were in the land of the infidels and they took nothing from us, but wrote us a passport, that none shall do us hindrance or work our mischance.' if he ask you, 'what profit had ye of your property in the land of roum?' answer him, 'we profited in the deliverance of a pious man, who had been bound down in an underground cell nigh fifteen years, crying out for help yet none helped him. nay, the infidels tortured him night and day. we knew not this; but, after we had tarried in constantinople for some time, having sold our goods and bought others in their stead, we determined on and made ready for a return to our native land. we spent that night conversing about our journey and when day broke, we saw figured upon the wall a human form and as we drew nigh it, behold, it moved and said, 'o moslems, is there amongst you one who is minded to woo the favour of the lord of the three worlds?'  'how so?' asked we; and the figure answered, 'know that allah hath made me speak to you, to the intent that your faith be fortified, and that your belief embolden you and that you may go forth of the country of the infidels and repair to the moslem host; for with them wones the sword of the com passionate one, of our age the champion, king sharrkan, by whom he shall conquer constantinople town and destroy the sect of the nazarene. and when ye shall have journeyed three days, you will find an hermitage known as the hermitage of the ascetic matruhina  and containing a cell; visit it with pure intent and contrive to arrive there by force of will, for therein is a religious from the holy city, jerusalem, by name abdullah, and he is one of the devoutest of mankind, endowed with the power of working saintly miracles  such as dispel doubts and obscurity. certain of the monks seized him by fraud and shut him up in a souterrain where he hath lain a long time. by his deliverance you will please the lord of faithful men, for such release is better than fighting for the faith.'"" now when the ancient dame and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, ""as soon as that which i impart shall reach the ears of king sharrkan, say him further, 'hearing this from that image we knew that the holy man'""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the ninety-fourth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the old woman, zat al-dawahi, and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, ""now as soon as that which i impart shall reach the ears of king sharrkan say him further, 'hearing these words from that image we knew that the holy man was indeed of the chiefest devotees and allah's servants of purest qualities; so we made three days' march till we came in sight of that hermitage, and then we went up to it and passed the day in buying and selling, as is the wont of merchants. as soon as day had departed our sight and night was come to darken light, we repaired to the cell wherein was the dungeon, and we heard the holy man, after chanting some verses of the koran, repeat the following couplets,  'my heart disheartened is, my breast is strait, * and sinks my             soul in sea of bale and bate unless escape be near i soon shall die; * and death were better              than this doleful strait: o lightning an thou light my home and folk, * an their still              brighter charms thy shine abate, say, what my path to meet them, being barred * by wars, and              barricado'd succour's gate?'  ""when once ye have brought me into the moslem camp, and i mix with them you shall see,"" the old woman continued, ""how i will make shift to beguile them and slay them all, even to the last man."" the nazarenes hearing whet she said, kissed her hands and set her in the chest, after they had beaten her with a grievous beating in obedience to her commands, for they saw it was incumbent on them to do her bidding in this; then they all made for the moslem host as hath erst been said. such was the case with the damned hag, zat al-dawahi and her companions; but as regards the mohammeden army, they indeed, after allah had given them victory over their enemies and they had plundered everything in the ships of money and hoards, all sat down to converse with one another and zau al-makan said to his brother sharrkan, ""verily, allah hath granted us to prevail because of our just dealing and discipline and concord amongst ourselves; wherefore continue, o sharrkan, to obey my commandment, in submission to allah (be he exalted and extolled!), for i mean to slay ten kings in blood revenge for my sire, to cut the throat of fifty thousand greeks and to enter constantinople."" replied sharrkan, ""my life be thy ransom against death! needs must i follow out the holy war, though i wone many a year in their country. but i have, o my brother, in damascus a daughter, named kuzia fakan, whom i love heartily for she is one of the marvels of the time and she will soon be of age.' said zau al-makan, ""and i also have left my wife with child and near her time, nor do i know what allah will vouchsafe me by her. but promise me, o my brother, that if allah bless me with a son, thou wilt grant me thy daughter for wife to him, and make covenant with me and pledge me thy faith thereon."" ""with love and good will, replied sharrkan; and, stretching out his hand to his brother, he said, if she bring thee a son, i will give him my daughter kuzia fakan, to wife."" at this zau al-makan rejoiced, and they fell to congratulating each other on the victory over the enemy. and the wazir dandan also congratulated the two brothers and said to them, ""know, o ye kings, that allah hath given us the victory, for that we have devoted our lives to him (be he exalted and ex tolled!); and we have left our homes and households; and it is my counsel that we follow up the foe and press upon him and harass him, so haply allah shall enable us to win our wishes, and we shall destroy our enemies, branch and root. if it please you, do ye go down in these ships and sail over the sea, whilst we fare forward by land and bear the brunt of battle and the thrust of fight."" and the minister dandan ceased not to urge them to combat and repeated his words who said,  ""to slay my foes is chiefest bliss i wist, * and on the courser's             back be borne a list; comes promising tryst a messenger from friend * full oft, when             comes the friend withouten tryst."" and these words of another,  ""war for my mother (an i live) i'll take; * spear for my brother;            scymitar for sire with every shag haired brave who meets his death * smiling, till            won from doom his dear desire!""  and when the wazir ended his verses, he said, ""praise be to him who aided us dear victory to uphold and who hath given us spoil of silver and fine gold!"" then zau al-makan commanded the army to depart; and they fared on forcing their marches for constantinople, till they came to a wide and spacious champaign, full of all things fair and fain, with wild cattle frisking and gazelles pacing to and fro across the plain. now they had traversed great deserts and drink had been six days cut off from them, when they drew near this meadow and saw therein waters founting and ripe fruits daunting and that land as it were paradise; for it had donned its adornments and decked itself.  gently waved the branches of its trees drunken with the new wine of the dew, and combined with the nectar of tasnim the soft breathings of the morning breeze. mind and gazer were confounded by its beauty, even as saith the poet,  ""behold this lovely garden! 'tis as though * spring o'er its            frame her greeny cloak had spread. looking with fleshly eyne, thou shalt but sight * a lake whose             waters balance in their bed, but look with spirit eyes and lo! shalt see * glory in every            leaf o'erwaves thy head.""  and as another saith,  ""the stream's a cheek by sunlight rosy dyed, * whose down            is creeping shade of tamarisk stems round legs of tree trunks waveless roll in rings * silvern, and            blossoms are the diadems.""  when zau al-makan saw this champaign, with its trees bowing and its flowers blooming and its birds warbling, he called to his brother sharrkan and said, ""o my brother, verily in damascus is naught the like of this place. we will not march from it save after three days, that we may take rest ourselves and that the army of al-islam may regain strength and their souls be fortified to encounter the blamed infidels."" so they halted therein and while camping behold, they heard a noise of voices from afar, and zau al-makan asked the cause thereof, and was answered that a caravan of merchants from the land of syria had halted there to rest and that the moslem troops had come on them and had haply seized something of the goods which they had brought from the country of the infidels. after a while up came the merchants, crying out and appealing to the king for aidance. when zau al- makan saw this, he bade them be brought before him and, when in presence they said to him, ""o king, we have been in the country of the infidels and they plundered us of nothing: why then do our brothers the moslems despoil our goods, and we in their own land? of a truth when we saw your troops, we went up to them and they robbed us of what we had with us and we have now reported to thee all that hath befallen us."" thereupon they brought out to him the letter of the king of constantinople, and sharrkan read it and said, ""we will presently restore to you what hath been taken from you; but yet it behoveth you not to carry merchandise to the country of the infidels."" replied they, ""o our lord, in very sooth allah despatched us thither that we might win what gházi  never won the like of, not even thou in all thy razzias."" asked sharrkan, ""what was it ye won?"" ""o king,"" answered they, ""we will not tell thee save in private; for if this matter be noised among the folk, haply it may come to the ears of some,  and this will be the cause of our ruin and of the ruin of all moslems who resort to the land of the greeks."" now they had hidden the chest wherein was the damned zat al- dawahi. so zau al-makan and his brother brought them to a private place, where they laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee, and wept till they made the two kings weep.—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the ninety-fifth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the nazarenes who wore merchants' weed, when brought to a private place by zau al-makan and his brother sharrkan, laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two kings weep and repeated to them all which had been taught by the old witch zat al-dawahi. thereupon sharrkan's heart yearned to the devotee and he was moved to ruth for him and was fired with zeal for the service of almighty allah. so quoth he to them, ""did ye rescue this holy man or is he still in the hermitage?"" quoth they, ""we delivered him and slew the hermit, fearing for our lives; after which we made haste to fly for dread of death; but a trusty man told us that in this hermitage are quintals of gold and silver and stones of price."" then they fetched the chest and brought out the accursed old woman, as she were a cassia pod  for excess of blackness and leanness, and she was laden with the same fetters and shackles. when zau al-makan and the bystanders saw her, they took her for a man of the best of allah's devotees and surpassing in pious qualities, more especially because of the shining of her forehead for the ointment wherewith she had anointed her face. so zau al-makan and sharrkan wept sore; then they rose up in honour and kissed her hands and feet, sobbing aloud: but she signed to them and said, ""cease this weeping and hear my words. hereat they dried their tears in obedience to her bidding, and she said, ""know ye both that i was content to accept what my lord did unto me, for i kenned that the affliction which befel me was a trial from him (be he exalted and extolled!); and whoso hath not patience under calamity and tribulation, for him there is no coming to the delights of paradise. i had indeed supplicated him that i might return to my native land, not as a compensation for the sufferings decreed to me, but that i might die under the horse hoofs of warriors fighting for the faith who, being slain in fray, live again without suffering death.""  then she repeated the following couplets,  ""our fort is tor,  and flames the fire of fight: * moses             art thou and this is time for aid: cast down thy rod, 'twill swallow all they wrought, * nor dread             for men their ropes be vipers made.  for chapters read on fight day lines of foes, * and on their             necks 'grave versets  wi' thy blade!""  when the old woman had ended her verse, her eyes overflowed with tears and her forehead under the unguent shone like gleaming light, and sharrkan rose and kissed her hand and caused food be brought before her: but she refused it, saying, ""i have not broken my fast by day for fifteen years; and how should i break it at such a time when my lord hath been bountiful to me in delivering me from the captivity of the infidels and removing from me that which was more grievous to me than torment of fire? i will wait till sun down."" so when it was nightfall, sharrkan and zau al-makan came and served her with food and said, ""eat, o ascetic!"" but she said, ""this is no time for eating; it is the time for worshipping the requiting king."" then she stood up in the prayer niche and remained praying till the night was spent; and she ceased not to do after this fashion for three days and nights, sitting not but at the time of the salám or salutation  ending with several prayers. when zau al- makan saw her on this wise, firm belief in her get hold of his heart and he said to sharrkan, ""cause a tent of perfumed leather to be pitched for this religious, and appoint a body servant to wait upon him."" on the fourth day she called for food; so they brought her all kinds of meats that could seduce the sense or delight the sight; but of all this she would eat only a scone with salt. then she again turned to her fast and, as the night came, she rose anew to pray; when sharrkan said to zau al-makan, ""verily, this man carrieth renunciation of the world to the extreme of renouncing, and, were it not for this holy war, i would join myself to him and worship allah in his service, till i came before his presence. and now i desire to enter his tent and talk with him for an hour."" quoth zau al-makan, ""and i also: tomorrow we sally forth to fight against constantinople, and we shall find no time like the present."" said the wazir dandan, ""and i no less desire to see this ascetic; haply he will pray for me that i find death in this holy war and come to the presence of my lord, for i am aweary of the world."" so as soon as night had darkened, they repaired to the tent of that witch, zat al-dawahi; and, seeing her standing to pray, they drew near her and fell a weeping for pity of her; but she paid no heed to them till midnight was past, when she ended her orisons by pronouncing the salutation. then she turned to them and after wishing them long life, asked them ""wherefore come ye?"", whereto they answered, ""o thou holy man! diddest thou not hear us weep around thee?"" she rejoined, ""to him who standeth in the presence of allah, remaineth no existence in time, either for hearing any or for seeing aught about him."" quoth they, ""we would have thee recount to us the cause of thy captivity and pray for us this night, for that will profit us more than the possession of constantinople."" now when she heard their words she said, ""by allah, were ye not the emirs of the moslems, i would not relate to you aught of this at any time; for i complain not but to allah alone. however, to you i will relate the circumstances of my captivity. know, then, that i was in the saintly city of jerusalem with certain ecstatics and inspired men, and did not magnify myself among them, for that allah (be he exalted and extolled!) had endowed me with humility and abnegation, till i chanced to go down to the sea one night and walked upon the water. then entered into me pride; whence i know not, and i said to myself, 'who like me can walk the water?' and my heart from that time hardened and allah afflicted me with the love of travel. so i journeyed to roum land and visited every part for a whole year, and left no place but therein i worshiped allah. when i came to this spot,  i clomb the mountain and saw there an hermitage, inhabited by a monk called matrubina, who, when he sighted me, came out and kissed my hands and feet and said, 'verily, i have seen thee since thou enteredst the land of the greeks, and thou hast filled me with longing for the land of al-islam.' then he took my hand and carried me into that hermitage, and brought me to a dark room; and, when i entered it unawares, he locked the door on me and left me there forty days, without meat or drink; for it was his intent to kill me by delay. it chanced one day, that a knight called dakianús  came to the hermitage, accompanied by ten squires and his daughter tamásil, a girl whose beauty was incom parable. when they entered that hermitage, the monk matruhina told them of me, and the knight said, 'bring him out, for surely there is not on him a bird's meal of meat.' so they opened the door of the dark room and found me standing in the niche, praying and reciting the koran and glorifying allah and humbling myself before the almighty. when they saw me in this state matrohina exclaimed, 'this man is indeed a sorcerer of the sorcerers!'; and hearing his words, they all came in on me, dakianus and his company withal, and they beat me with a grievous beating, till i desired death and reproached myself, saying, 'this is his reward who exalteth himself and who prideth himself on that which allah hath vouchsafed to him, beyond his own competence! and thou, o my soul, verily self esteem and arrogance have crept into thee. dost thou not know that pride angereth the lord and hardeneth the heart and bringeth men to the fire?' then they laid me in fetters and returned me to my place which was the dungeon under ground. every three days, they threw me down a scone of barley bread and a draught of water; and every month or two the knight came to the hermitage. now his daughter tamasil had grown up, for she was nine years old when i first saw her, and fifteen years passed over me in captivity, so that she had reached her four and twentieth year. there is not in our land nor in the land of the greeks a fairer than she, and her father feared lest the king take her from him; for she had vowed herself to the messiah and rode with dakianus in the habit of a cavalier, so that albeit none might compare with her in loveliness, no one who saw her knew her for a woman. and her father had laid up his monies in this hermitage, every one who had aught of price or treasured hoard being wont to deposit it therein; and i saw there all manner of gold and silver and jewels and precious vessels and rarities, none may keep count of them save almighty allah. now ye are worthier of these riches than those infidels; so lay hands on that which is in the hermitage and divide it among the moslems and especially on fighters in the holy war. when these merchants came to constantinople and sold their merchandise, that image which is on the wall spoke to them, by grace of a marvel which allah granted to me; so they made for that hermitage and slew matruhina, after torturing him with most grievous torments, and dragging him by the beard, till he showed them the place where i was; when they took me and found no path but flight for dread of death. now tomorrow night tamasil will visit that hermitage as is her habit, and her father and his squires will come after her, as he feareth for her; so, if ye would witness these things, take me with you and i will deliver to you the monies and the riches of the knight dakianus which be in that mountain; for i saw them bring out vessels of gold and silver to drink therefrom, and i heard a damsel of their company sing to them in arabic and well-away! that so sweet a voice should not be busied in chaunting the koran. if, then, ye will; enter into that hermitage and hide there against the coming of dakianus and his daughter; and take her, for she is fit only for the king of the age, sharrkan, or king zau al-makan."" thereat they all rejoiced with the exception of the wazir dandan, who put scant faith in her story, for her words took no hold on his reason, and signs of doubt in her and disbelief showed in his face.  yet he was confounded at her discourse, but he feared to speak with her for awe of the king. then quoth the ancient dame, zat al-dawahi, ""verily, i fear lest the knight come and, seeing these troops encamped in the meadow, be afraid to enter the hermitage."" so zau al-makan ordered the army to march upon constantinople and said, ""i have resolved to take with me an hundred horse and many mules and make for that mountain, where we will load the beasts with the monies which be in the hermitage."" then he sent at once for the chief chamberlain whom they brought into the presence; and he summoned likewise the leaders of the turks and daylamites and said, ""as soon as it is dawn, do ye set forth for constantinople; and thou, o chamberlain, shalt take my place in council and contrivance, while thou, o rustam, shalt be my brother's deputy in battle. but let none know that we are not with you and after three days we will rejoin you."" then he chose out an hundred of the doughtiest riders, and he and sharrkan and the minister dandan set out for the hermitage, and the hundred horsemen led the mules with chests for transporting the treasure.—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the ninety-sixth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that sharrkan and his brother, zau al-makan and the wazir dandan set off with an hundred horse for the hermitage described to them by that accursed zat al-dawahi, and they took with them mules and chests for transporting the treasure. now as soon as dawned the morn, the chamberlain signalled to the host an order for departure, and they set out thinking that the two kings and the wazir were with them; knowing not that the three had made for the monastery. such was the case with the host, but as regards the two kings and the minister, they tarried in their place till the end of that day. now the infidels who were with zat al-dawahi took their departure privily, after they had gone in to her and kissed her hands and feet and obtained her leave to march. so she not only gave them permission but also taught them all she minded of wile and guile. and when it was dark night, she arose and went in to zau al-makan and his companions and said to them, ""come, let us set out for the mountain, and take with you a few men at arms."" they obeyed her and left five horsemen at the foot of the mountain, whilst the rest rode on before zat al-dawahi, who gained new strength for excess of joy, so that zau al-makan said, ""glory be to him who sustaineth this holy man, whose like we never saw!"" now the witch had written a letter to the king of constantinople and despatched it on the wings of a bird,  acquainting him with what had passed and ending, ""i wish thee to send me ten thousand horsemen of the bravest of the greeks and let them steal along the foot of the mountains with caution, lest the host of al-islam get sight of them; and, when they reach the hermitage, let them ambush themselves there, till i come to them with the moslem king and his brother, for i shall inveigle them and will bring them thither, together with the wazir and an hundred horse and no more, that i may presently deliver to them the crosses which be in the hermitage. i am resolved to slay the monk matruhina, since my scheme cannot be carried out but by taking his life. if my plot work well, not one of the moslems shall return to his own country; no, not a living wight nor one who blows the fire alight; and matruhina shall be a sacrifice for the followers of the nazarene faith and the servants of the cross, and praise be to the messiah, first and last."" when this letter reached constantinople, the keeper of the carrier pigeons carried it to king afridun, who read it and forthwith inspected his host and equipped ten thousand cavaliers with horses and dromedaries and mules and provaunt and bade them repair to that hermitage and, after reaching the tower, to hide therein. thus far concerning them; but as regards king zau al-makan and his brother sharrkan and the wazir dandan and the escort, when they reached the hermitage they entered and met the monk matruhina, who came out to see who and what they were; whereupon quoth that pious man zat al-dawahi, ""slay this damned fellow.""  so they smote him with their swords and made him drink the cup of death. then the accursed old woman carried them to the place of offerings and ex votos, and brought out to them treasures and precious things more than she had described to them; and after gathering the whole together, they set the booty in chests and loaded the mules therewith. as for tamasil, she came not, she or her father, for fear of the moslems; so zau al-makan tarried there, awaiting her all that day and the next and a third, till sharrkan said to him, ""by allah, i am troubled anent the army of al-islam, for i know not what is become of them."" his brother replied, ""and i also am concerned for them: we have come by this great treasure and i do not believe that tamasil or any one else will approach the hermitage, after that befel which hath befallen the host of the christians. it behoveth us, then, to content ourselves with what allah hath given us and depart; so haply he will help us conquer constantinople."" accordingly they came down from the mountain, while zat al-dawahi was impotent to oppose their march for fear of betraying her deceit; and they fared forwards till they reached the head of a defile, where the old woman had laid an ambush for them with the ten thousand horse. as soon as these saw the moslems they encircled them from all sides, couching lance and baring the white sabre blade; and the infidels shouted the watch word of their faithless faith and set the shafts of their mischief astring. when zau al-makan and his brother sharrkan and the minister dandan looked upon this host, they saw that it was a numerous army and said, ""who can have given these troops information of us?"" replied sharrkan, ""o my brother, this be no time for talk; this is the time for smiting with swords and shooting with shafts) so gird up your courage and hearten your hearts, for this strait is like a street with two gates; though, by the virtue of the lord of arabs and ajams, were not the place so narrow i would bring them to naught, even though they were an hundred thousand men!"" said zau al-makan, ""had we wotted this we would have brought with us five thousand horse;"" and the wazir dandan continued, ""if we had ten thousand horse they had availed us naught in these narrows; but allah will succour us against them. i know this defile and its straitness, and i know there be many places of refuge in it; for i have been here on razzia with king omar bin al-nu'uman, what while we besieged constantinople. we abode in this place, and here is water colder than snow. so come, let us push out of this defile ere the infidel host increase on us and get the start of us to the mountain top, whence they will hurl down rocks upon us, and we powerless to come at them."" so they began hurrying on to get out of those narrows; but the pious man, zat al-dawahi, looked at them and said, ""what is it ye fear, ye who have vowed yourselves to the lord, and to working his will? by allah, i abode imprisoned underground for fifteen years, yet never gainsaid the almighty in aught he did with me! fight ye in allah's way; so whoever of you is slain paradise shall be his abode, and whoso slayeth, his striving shall be to his honour."" when they heard from the ascetic these words, their care and anxiety ceased from them and they stood firm till the infidels charged down from all sides, whilst the swords played upon their necks and the cup of death went round amongst them. the moslems fought for the service of allah a right good fight, and wrought upon his foes with sway of sword and lunge of lance; whilst zau al-makan smote upon the men and garred the knights bite the dust and their heads from their bodies take flight, five by five and ten by ten, till he had done to death a number of them past numbering and an accompt beyond counting. now while so doing, he looked at the accursed old woman who was waving her sword and heartening them, and all who feared fled to her for shelter; but she was also signing the infidels to slay sharrkan. so troop after troop rushed on him with design to do him die; but each troop that charged, he charged and drove back; and when another troop attacked him he repelled the assault with the sword in their backs; for he thought it was the devotee's blessing that gave him the vic tory, and he said in himself, ""verily on this holy men allah looketh with eyes of his favour and strengtheneth my prowess against the infidels with the purity of his pious intent: for i see that they fear me and cannot prevail against me, but every one who assaileth me turneth tail and taketh flight."" so they battled the rest of the day and, when night fell, the moslems took refuge in a cave of that defile being weary with stress of war and cast of stone: and that day were slain of them five and forty. and when they were gathered together, they sought the devotee, but could find no trace of him; and this was grievous to them and they said, ""belike, he hath died a martyr."" quoth sharrkan, ""i saw him heartening the horsemen with divine instances and using as talisman verses of holy writ."" now while they were talking, behold, the accursed old woman, zat al-dawahi, stood before them, hending in hand the head of the chief captain of the ten thousand horse, a noble knight, a champion fierce in fight and a satan for blight. one of the turks had slain him with an arrow, and allah hurried his soul to the fire; and when the infidels saw what that moslem had done with their leader, they all fell on him and wrought his bane and hewed him in pieces with their swords, and allah hurried his soul to heaven. then the accursed old woman cut off that knight's head and brought it and threw it at the feet of sharrkan and zau al-makan and the wazir dandan. now when sharrkan sew her, he sprang up hastily before her and exclaimed, ""praised be allah for thy safety and for our sighting thee, o holy man and devout champion of the religion!"" replied she, o my son, i have sought martyrdom this day, and have thrown my life away amid the infidel array, but they feared me with dismay. when ye dispersed, i waxed jealous for your honour; so i rushed on the chief knight their leader, albeit he was a match for a thousand horse, and i smote him till i severed head from trunk. not one of the infidels could near me; so i brought his head to you,""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the ninety-seventh night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the damned witch, zat al-dawahi, took the head of the knight, the leader of the twenty thousand infidels, she brought it and threw it down before zau al-makan and his brother sharrkan and the wazir dandan, saying, ""when i saw your condition, i waxed jealous for your honour; so i rushed on the chief knight and smote him with the sword till i severed head from trunk. and none could near me, so i brought his head to you, that you may be strengthened in holy war and work out with your swords the will of the lord of the faithful. and now i purpose leaving you to strive against the infidels, whilst i go to your army, though they be at the gates of constantinople, and return with twenty thousand horse to destroy these unfaithfuls."" quoth sharrkan, ""how wilt thou pass to them, o thou holy man, seeing that the valley is blocked up on all sides by the miscreants?"" quoth the accursed hag, ""allah will veil me from their eyes and they shall not sight me;  nor, if any saw me, would he dare to attack me at that time, for i shall be as one non existing, absorbed in allah, and he will fend off from me his foes."" ""thou sayest sooth, o holy man,"" rejoined sharrkan, ""for indeed i have been witness of that; so, if thou can pass out at the first of the night, 'twill be best for us."" replied she, ""i will set out at this very hour and, if thou desire, thou shalt go with me and none shall see thee. furthermore if thy brother also have a mind to go with us we will take him, but none else; for the shadow of a saint can cover only twain."" sharrkan said, ""as for me i will not leave my comrades; but, if my brother will, there is no harm in his going with thee and setting us free of this strait; for he is the stronghold of the moslems and the sword of the lord of the three worlds; and if it be his pleasure, let him take with him the wazir dandan, or whom else he may elect and send us ten thousand horse to succour us against these caitiffs."" so after debate they agreed on this and the old woman said, ""give me leisure to go before you and consider the condition of the infidels, if they be asleep or awake."" quoth they, ""we will not go forth save with thee and trust our affair to allah."" ""if i do your bidding,"" replied she, ""blame me not but blame yourselves; for it is my rede that you await me till i bring you tidings of the case."" then said sharrkan, ""go to them and delay not from us, for we shall be awaiting thee."" thereupon she fared forth and sharrkan turned to his brother addressing him and said, ""were not this holy man a miracle worker, he had never slain yonder furious knight. this is proof sufficient of the ascetic's power; and of a truth the pride of the infidels is laid low by the slaying of this cavalier, for he was violent, an evil devil and a stubborn."" now whilst they were thus devising of the mighty works of the devotee, behold, the accursed zat al-dawahi came upon them and promised them victory over the unbelievers; wherefor they thanked her (not knowing that all this was wile and guile) and the damned hag asked, ""where be the king of the age, zau al-makan, and the minister dandan?"" answered he, ""here am i!"" take with thee thy wazir,"" said she, ""and follow after me, that we may fare forth to constantinople."" now she had acquainted the infidels with the cheat she had put upon the moslems, and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and said, our hearts will not be contented till we shall have slain their king in return for the knight's death; because we had no stouter rider than he;"" and they added (bespeaking the ill omened hag as she told them her plan of faring to the land of the moslems), ""when thou bringest him to us, we will bear him to king afridun."" then she went out and went out with her zau al-makan and the minister dandan, and she walked on before the two saying, ""fare forth with the blessing of almighty allah!"" so they did her bidding, for the shaft of pate and fortune of man's lot had shot them, and she ceased not leading them both through the midst of the grecian camp, till they came to the defile, the narrow pass aforesaid, whilst the infidel enemy watched them, but did them no hindrance; for the infernal old woman had enjoined this. now when zau al-makan and the wazir dandan saw that the infidel host offered them no let and stay and yet had them in sight, the wazir exclaimed, ""by allah, this is one of the holy man's saintly miracles! and doubtless he be of the elect."" rejoined zau al-makan, ""by allah, i think the infidels be naught but blind, for we see them and they see us not."" and while they were thus praising the holy man and recounting his mighty works and his piety and his prayers, behold, the infidels charged down on them from all sides and surrounded them and seized them, saying, ""is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him too?"" and the wazir dandan replied, ""see you not yon other man that is before us? ' replied the unbelievers, ""by the truth of the messiah and the monks, and the primate and the metropolitan, we see none save you two!"" then zau al-makan said, ""by allah, this is a chastisement decreed to us by almighty allah!""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the ninety-eighth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when the unfaithful had seized upon king zau al-makan and the wazir dandan, they said to the two, ""is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him also?"" and the wazir dandan replied, ""see you not yon other man who be with us?"" they rejoined, ""by the truth of the messiah and the monks and the primate and the metropolitan, we see none save you two!"" then the infidels laid shackles on their feet and set men to guard them during the night, whilst zat al-dawahi fared on and disappeared from their sight. so they fell to lamenting and saying to each other, ""verily, the opposing of pious men leadeth to greater distress than this, and we are punished by the strait which hath befallen us."" so far concerning zau al-makan and the wazir dandan; but as regards king sharrkan, he passed that night in the cavern with his comrades, and when dawned the day and he had prayed the morn prayer, he and his men made ready to do battle with the infidel and he heartened them and promised them all good. then they sallied out till they were hard upon the unbelievers and, when these saw them from afar, they cried out to them, saying, ""o moslems, we have taken captives your sultan and your wazir who hath the ordering of your affairs; and except ye leave off fighting us, we will slay you to the last man; but an you yield yourselves we will take you to our king, who will make peace with you on condition that you quit our country and return home and harm us in naught, and we will do you no harm in aught. if ye accept, it will be well for you; but if ye refuse there remaineth nothing for you but death. so we have told you sooth, and this is our last word to you."" now when sharrkan heard this and was certified of the captivity of his brother and the wazir dandan, he was weighed down with woe and wept; his force failed him and, making sure of death, he said to himself, ""would i knew the cause of their capture! did they fail of respect to the holy man or disobey him, or what was the matter?"" then they sprang up to battle with the unbelievers and slew great numbers of them. the brave was known that day from craven men, and sword and spear were dyed with bloody stain; for the infidels flocked up on them, as flies flock to drink, from hill and from plain; but sharrkan and his men ceased not to wage the fight of those who fear not to die, nor let death hinder them from the pursuit of victory, till the valley ran gore and earth was full of the slain she bore. and when night fell the armies separated each making for his own place; and the moslems returned to the cavern where gain and loss were manifest to them: few remained of them and there was no dependence for them but on allah and the scymitar. now there had been slain of them that day five and thirty men of the chiefest emirs, and they had killed thousands of the infidels, footmen and fighters on horse. when sharrkan saw this, the case was grievous to him and he asked his comrades ""what shall we do?""; whereto all answered, ""that which almighty allah willeth shall befal us."" on the morning of the second day, sharrkan said to the remnant of his troop, ""if ye go forth to fight, not one of you will remain alive and we have but little left of food and water; so i deem ye would do better to bare your brands and go forth and stand at the mouth of this cavern, to hinder any from entering. haply the holy man may have reached the moslem host, and may return with ten thousand horses to succour us in fight with the infidels, for belike the unfaithful may have failed to see him and those with him."" they said, this were the better course to take, and of its expediency no doubt we make."" so the troop went out and held the cavern mouth standing by its walls; and every one of the infidels who sought to enter in, they slew. thus did they fend off the foe from the gape of the cave and they patiently supported all such assaults, till day was done and night came on dusky and dun;—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the ninety-ninth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that the army of the moslems held the cavern mouth and stood by its walls and they fended off the foe, and every one of the infidels attempted to charge them, him they slew; and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun, by which time king sharrkan had only five and twenty men and no more left. then quoth the infidels to one another, ""when shall these battle days have an end? we are weary of warring the moslems."" and quoth one of them, ""up and at them, for there remain of them but five and twenty men! if we cannot prevail on them to fight, let us light a fire upon them;  and if they submit themselves and yield to us, we will take them prisoners; but if they refuse we will leave them for fuel to the fire, so shall they become to men of foreseeing mind a warning dire. may the messiah on their fathers have no grace, and may the sojourn of the nazarenes be for them no abiding place!"" so they carried fuel to the jaws of the cavern and set fire to it. thereupon sharrkan and his companions made sure of perdition and yielded themselves prisoners. and while they were in this condition, lo! the knight their captain said to those who counselled their slaughter, ""it is not for any save for king afridun to kill them, that he may gratify his wrath; therefore it behoveth us to keep them in durance by us till the morrow, when we will journey with them to constantinople and deliver them to our king, who shall deal with them as he please."" said they, ""this is the right course;"" and he commanded to pinion them and set guards over them. then, as soon as it was black night, the infidels busied themselves with feasting and making festival; and they called for wine and drank it till all fell upon their backs. now sharrkan and his brother, zau al-makan, were in confinement and so also were his companion knights; whereupon the elder turned to the younger brother and said to him, ""o my brother, how win free?"" ""by allah,"" replied zau al makan, ""i know not; for here we be like birds in cage."" then sharrkan waxed wroth and sighed for excess of rage and stretched himself, till his pinion bonds brass asunder; whereupon being free he arose and went up to the captain of the guard, and taking from his pocket the keys of the fetters, freed zau al-makan and the wazir dandan and the rest of his men. then he turned to the two and said, ""i desire to slay three of these infidels and take and don their dress, we three; so that we shall be guised as greeks and we will pass through them, with out their knowing us, and fare forth to our own force."" replied zau al-makan, ""this is no safe counsel for if we kill them, i fear some of their comrades may hear their shrieks and the foe be aroused upon us and kill us. 'twere the surer way to pass out of the defile."" so they agreed upon this and set out; and, when they had left the head of the strait a little distance behind, they saw horses picketed and the riders sleeping: and sharrkan said to his brother, ""better we take each one of us a steed."" there were five and twenty horsemen, so they took five and twenty horses, whilst allah sent sleep upon the infidels for a purpose he knew and the faithful mounted and fared on till they were out of reach. meanwhile sharrkan set to gathering from the infidels as many weapons, swords, and spears, as were wanted. and while they took saddle and struck forwards none of the infidels supposed that anyone could release zau al-makan and his brother and their men; or that their prisoners had power to escape. now when all the captives were safe from the unfaithful, sharrkan came up with his comrades, and found them awaiting his arrival, on coals of flame, expecting him in anxious grame, so he turned to them and said, ""feel no fear since allah protecteth us. i have that to propose which haply shall effect our purpose."" ""what is it?"" asked they and he answered, ""i desire that ye all climb to the mountain top and cry out with one voice, 'allaho akbar!' and ye add, 'the army of al islam is upon you! allaho akbar!' this wise their company will surely be dissolved nor will they find out the trick for they are drunk, but they will think that the moslem troops have encompassed them about on all sides and have mingled with them; so they will fall on one another brand in hand during the confusion of drunkenness and sleep, and we will cleave them asunder with their own swords and the scymitar will go round amongst them till dawn."" replied zau al-makan, ""this plan is not good; we should do better to make our way to our army and speak not a word; for if we cry out 'allaho akbar,' they will wake and fall on us and not one of us will escape."" rejoined sharrkan, ""by allah, though they should awake tis no matter, and i long that ye fall in with my plan, for naught save good can come of it!"" so they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain and shouted, ""allaho akbar!"" and hills and trees and rocks reworded their allaho akbar for fear of the almighty. but when the kafirs heard this slogan they cried out to one another,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the one hundredth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that sharrkan spake thus, ""i long that ye fall in with this my plan, for naught save good can come of it."" so they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain head and shouted, ""allaho akbar!""; and hills and trees and rocks re worded their allaho akbar for fear of the almighty. the infidels heard it and cried out one to other and donned their armour and said, ""the foe is upon us, by the truth of the messiah!"" then they fell on one another and slew of their own men more than any knoweth save almighty allah. as soon as it was dawn, they sought for the captives, but found no trace of them, and their captains said, ""they who did this were the prisoners in our possession; up, then, and after them in all haste till ye overtake them, when we will make them quaff the cup of requital; and let not fright nor the panic of sudden awaking possess you."" so they took horse and rode after the fugitives and it wanted but an eye twinkling before they overtook them and surrounded them. now when zau al-makan saw this, he was seized with increase of terror and said to his brother, ""what i feared would come, is come upon us, and now it remaineth only for us to fight for the faith."" but sharrkan preferred to hold his peace. then zau al- makan and his companions rushed down from the hill crest, shouting, ""allaho akbar!"" and his men repeated the war cry and addressed themselves to fight and to sell their lives in the service of the lord of faithful men; and while they were in this case, behold, they heard many voices voicing, ""there is no god but the god! god is most great! salutation and salvation upon the apostle, the bringer of glad tidings, the bearer of bad tidings!''  so they turned towards the direction of the sound and saw a company of moslems who believed in one god, pushing towards them, whereat their hearts were heartened and sharrkan charged upon the infidels crying out, ""there is no god but the god! god is most great! he and those with him, so that earth quaked as with an earthquake and the unbeliever host brake asunder and fled into the mountains and the moslems followed them with lunge and blow; and zau al-makan and his comrades of the moslems ceased not to smite the hosts of the infidel foe, and parted heads from bodies till day darkened and night coming on starkened sight. thereupon the moslems drew together and passed the night in congratulations, and, when morning dawned and daybreak shone with its shine and sheen, they saw bahram, the captain of the daylamites, and rustam, the captain of the turks, advancing to join them, with twenty thousand cavaliers like lions grim. as soon as they saw zau al-makan, the riders dismounted and saluted him, and kissed ground between his hands when he said to them, ""rejoice ye in the glad tidings of the victory of the moslem and the discomfiture of the tribe of unbelievers!"" then they gave one another joy of their deliverance and of the greatness of their reward after resurrection day. now the cause of the coming of the succours to that place was this. when the emir bahram and the emir rustam and the chief chamberlain, with the moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead, came in sight of constantinople they saw that the nazarenes had mounted the walls and manned the towers and the forts, and had set all their defenders in order of defence, as soon as they learned of the approach of the host of al-islam and the banners mohammedan, and they heard the clash of arms and the noise of war voices and tramp of horse hoofs and from their look outs they beheld the moslems, with their standards and ensigns of the faith of unity under the dust clouds and lo! they were like a flight of locusts or rain clouds raining rain, and the voices of the moslems chanting the koran and glorifying the compassionate one, struck their ears. now the infidels knew of the approach of this host through zat al-dawahi with her craft and whoredom,  calumny and contrivance. and the armies of al-islam drew near, as it were the swollen sea, for the multitude of footmen and horsemen and women and children. then quoth the general of the turks to the general of the daylamites, ""o emir, of a truth, we are in jeopardy from the multitude of the foe who is on the walls. look at yonder bulwarks and at this world of folk like the seas that clash with dashing billows. indeed yon infidel outnumbereth us an hundredfold and we cannot be safe from spies who may inform them that we are without a sultan. in very sooth, we run danger from these enemies, whose numbers may not be told and whose resources none can withhold, especially in the absence of king zau al-makan and his brother sharrkan and the illustrious wazir dandan. if they know of this, they will be emboldened to attack us in their absence and with the sword they will annihilate us to the last man; not one of us safety shall see. so it is my counsel that thou take ten thousand riders of the allies and the turks, and march them to the hermitage of matruhina and the meadow of malúkhiná in quest of our brothers and comrades. if thou act by my advice, it may be we shall approve ourselves the cause of their deliverance, in case they be hard pressed by the infidels; and if thou act not, blame will not attach to me. but, an ye go, it behoveth that ye return quickly, for ill suspicion is part of prudence."" the emir aforesaid fell in with his counsel; so they chose twenty thousand horse and they set out covering the roads and making for the monastery above mentioned. so much for the cause of their coming; but as regards the ancient dame, zat al-dawahi, as soon as she had delivered sultan zau al-makan and his brother sharrkan and the wazir dandan into the hands of the infidels, the foul whore mounted a swift steed, saying to the faithless, ""i design to rejoin the moslem army which is at constantinople and contrive for their destruction; for i will inform them that their chiefs are dead, and when they hear that from me, their joining will be disjointed and the cord of their confederation cut and their host scattered. then will i go to king afridun, lord of constantinople, and to my son hardub, king of roum, and relate to them their tidings and they will sally forth on the moslems with their troops and will destroy them and will not leave one of them alive."" so she mounted and struck across country on her good steed all the livelong night; and, when day dawned, appeared the armies of bahram and rustam advancing towards her. so she turned into a wayside brake and hid her horse among the trees and she walked a while saying to herself, ""haply the moslem hosts be returning, routed, from the assault of constantinople."" however, as she drew near them she looked narrowly and made sure that their standards were not reversed,  and she knew that they were coming not as conquered men, but fearing for their king and comrades. when she was assured of this, she hastened towards them, running at speed, like a devil of ill rede, till reaching them she cried out, ""haste ye! haste ye! o soldiers of the compassionate one, hasten to the holy war against the hosts of satan!"" when bahram saw her he dismounted and kissed the ground before her and asked her, ""o friend of allah what is behind thee?"" answered she, ""question not of sad case and sore condition; for when our comrades had taken the treasure from the hermitage of matruhina, and designed to win their way constantinople wards, thereupon came out on them a driving host and a dreadful of the infidels."" and the damned witch repeated to them the story to fill them with trouble and terror, adding, ""the most of them are dead, and there are but five and twenty men left."" said bahram, ""o holy man! when didst thou leave them?"" ""but this night,""  replied she. he cried, ""glory be to allah! to him who hath rolled up the far distance for thee like a rug, so that thou hast sped thus walking upon thy feet and props upon a mid-rib of palm-tree! but thou art one of the saints which fly like birds when inspired and possessed by his directions.""  then he mounted his horse, and he was perplexed and confounded by what he had heard from the beldam so strong in lies and ill calumnies, and he said, ""there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah, the glorious, the great! verily our labour is lost and our hearts are heavy within us, for our sultan is a prisoner and those who are with him."" then they cut across the country, wide and side, night and day, and when morning dawned they reached the head of the defile and saw zau al-makan and sharrkan shouting. ""there is no god but the god! allaho akbar! and salutation and salvation upon the congratulator, the comminator.""  whereupon he and his drove at the unbelievers and whelmed them, as the rain torrent whelms the waste; and cried out their war cries, till fear get hold of the prowess knights and the mountains were cloven in affright. and when shone the day and showed its shine and sheen, the breeze of morning blew upon them sweet and fragrant, and each recognised other as hath been said before. then they kissed the ground before the king and before his brother sharrkan, who told them all that had befallen the party in the cave. now thereat they marvelled and said to one another, ""hasten we back to constantinople, for we left our companions there, and our hearts are with them."" so they hurried departure, commending themselves to the subtle, the all-wise, and zau al-makan exhorted the moslems to steadfast- ness and versified in the following couplets,   ""be praises mine to all praiseworthy thee, * o lord, who stinted             not mine aid to be! though was i lost abroad, thou west to me * strongest support             which vouchsafed victory: thou gav'st me wealth and reign and goodly gifts, * and slungest             con quering sword of valiancy: thou mad'st me blest beneath thy kingly shade, * engraced with             generous boons dealt fain and free: thou savedst *from every fear i feared, by aid * of my wazir, the             age's noblest he! garred us thy grace in fight to throw the greek, * who yet came              back dight in war's cramoisie: then made i feint to fly from out the fight; * but like grim lion            turning made them flee, and left on valley sole my foemen, drunk * not with old            wine  but death-cup's revelry: then came the saintly hermit, and he showed * his marvels wrought             for town and wold to see; when slew they hero-wights who woke to dwell * in eden bowers            wherein sweet rill-lets well.""  but, when zau al-makan had made an end of versifying, his brother sharrkan congratulated him on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army.—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the one hundred and first night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that sharrkan congratulated his brother, zau al-makan, on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army. such was their case; but as regards the old woman, zat al-dawahi, after she had foregathered with the hosts of rustam and bahram, she returned to the coppice, where she took her steed and mounted and sped on at speed, till she drew near the moslem army that beleaguered constantinople, when she lighted down from her destrier and led it to the pavilion tent of the chief chamberlain. and when he saw her, he stood up to her in honour and signed to her with his right hand and said, ""welcome o pious recluse!"" then he questioned her of what had befallen, and she repeated to him her disquieting lies and deluding calumnies, saying, ""in sooth i fear for the emir rustam, and the emir bahram, for that i met them and theirs on the way and sent them and their following to relieve the king and his companions. now there are but twenty thousand horse and the unbelievers outnumber them; so i would have thee at this moment send off the rest of thy troops at full speed to their suc cour, lest they be slain to the last man."" and she cried to them, ""haste! haste!"" when the chamberlain and the moslems heard these words, their spirits fell and they wept; but zat al-dawahi said to them, ""ask aidance of allah and bear patiently this triburation; for ye have the example of those who have been before you of the people of mohammed; and paradise with its palaces is laid out by allah for those who die martyrs; and needs must all die, but most praiseworthy is dying while fighting for the faith."" the chamberlain, hearing this speech of the accursed old woman, called for the emir bahram's brother, a knight by name tarkash; and, choosing out for him ten thousand horse, riders famed for force, bade him set out at once. so he fared forth and marched all that day and the whole of the next night, till he neared the moslems. when daylight dawned, sharrkan saw the dust cloud about them and feared for the men of al-islam and said, ""if these troops which are coming upon us be moslem men our victory is assured by them; but, if these be nazarenes, there is no gainsaying destiny's decrees."" then he turned to his brother, zau al- makan, and said, never fear, for with my life i will ransom thee from death. if these be mohammedan troops, then were it an increase of heavenly favours; but, if they be our foes, there is no help save that we fight them. yet do i long to meet the holy man ere i die, so i may beg him to pray that i die not save by death of martyrdom."" whilst the twain were thus speaking, behold, there appeared the banners inscribed with the words, ""there is no god but the god and mohammed is the apostle of god;"" and sharrkan cried out, ""how is it with the moslems?"" ""all are sound and safe,"" replied they, ""and we came not but out of concern for you."" then the chief of the army dismounted and, kissing ground before sharrkan, asked, ""o my lord, how be the sultan and the wazir dandan and rustam and my brother bahram; are they all in safety?"" he answered, ""all well; but who brought thee tidings of us?"" quoth tarkash; ""it was the holy man who told us that he had met my brother bahram and rustam and had sent them both to you and he also assured us that the infidels had encompassed you and out numbered you; but i see not the case save the contrary thereof and that you are victorious."" they questioned him, ""and how did the holy man reach you?""; and he replied, ""walking on his feet and he had compassed in a day and a night, ten days' journey for a well girt horseman."" ""there is no doubt but that he is a saint of allah,"" said sharrkan, ""but where is he now?"" they rejoined, ""we left him with our troops, the folk of the faith, moving them to do battle with the rebels and the faithless."" thereat sharrkan rejoiced and all thanked allah for their own deliverance and the safety of the holy man; and commended the dead to his mercy saying, ""this was writ in the book."" then they set out making for constantinople by forced marches, and whilst they were on this enterprise, behold, a dust cloud arose to such height that it walled the two horizons, the eastern and the western, from man's sight and the day was darkened by it to night. but sharrkan looked at it and said, ""verily, i fear lest this be the infidels who have routed the army of al-islam for that this dust walleth the world, east and west, and hideth the two horizons, north and south."" presently appeared under the dust a pillar of darkness, blacker than the blackness of dismal days; nor ceased to come upon them that column more dreadful than the dread of the day of doom. horse and foot hastened up to look at it and know the terrors of the case, when behold, they saw it to be the recluse aforesaid; so they thronged round him to kiss his hands and he cried out, ""o people of the best of mankind,  the lamp which shineth in darkness blind, verily the infidels have outwitted the moslems by guile, for they fell upon the host of the one god whilst they deemed themselves safe from the faithless, and attacked them in their tents and made a sore slaughter of them what while they looked for no wile; so hasten to the aid of the believers in the unity of god, and deliver them from those who deny him!"" now when sharrkan heard these words, his heart flew from his breast with sore trouble; and, alighting from his steed in amazement, he kissed the recluse's hands and feet. on like wise did his brother, zau al-makan, and the rest of the foot and horse troops; except the wazir dandan, who dismounted not but said, ""by allah, my heart flieth from this devotee, for i never knew show of devotion to religion that bred not bane. so leave him and rejoin your comrades the moslems, for this man is of the outcasts from the gate of the mercy of the lord of the three worlds! how often have i here made razzias with king omar bin al-nu'uman and trodden the earth of these lands!"" said sharrkan, ""put away from thee such evil thought, hast thou not seen this holy man exciting the faithful to fight, and holding spears and swords light? so slander him not, for backbiting is blameable and poisoned is the flesh of the pious.  look how he inciteth us to fight the foe; and, did not almighty allah love him, he had cast him aforetime into fearful torment."" then sharrkan bade bring a nubian mule for the ascetic to ride and said, ""mount, o pious man, devout and virtuous!"" but the devotee refused to ride and feigned self denial, that he might attain his end; and they knew not that this holy personage was like him of whom the poet saith,  ""he prayeth and he fasteth for an end he doth espy; * when once his end is safely won then fast and prayer good bye.""   so the devotee ceased not to walk among the horsemen and the footmen, like a wily fox meditating guile, and began to uplift her voice, chanting the koran and praising the compassionate one. and they continued pressing forward till they approached the camp of al-islam, where sharrkan found the moslem in conquered plight and the chamberlain upon the brink of falling back in flight, whilst the sword of greece havoc dight among the faithful, the righteous and those who work upright,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the one hundred and second night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when sharrkan saw the moslems in conquered plight and the chamberlain upon the brink of retreat and flight and the sword havoc dight among the righteous and the workers of upright, the cause of this weakness among the moslems was that the accursed old woman, zat al- dawahi, the foe of the faith, after seeing that bahram and rustam had set forward with their troops to join sharrkan and his brother zau al-makan, repaired to the camp of the mahometans before constantinople and caused the mission of the emir tarkash, as hath been before said. in this her purpose was to divide the moslem forces the better to weaken them. then she left them and entered constantinople, and called with a loud voice on the knights of the greeks, saying, ""let me down a cord that i may tie thereto this letter, and do ye bear it to your king afridun, that he may read it and to my son king hardub that they both do what is written therein of bidding and forbidding."" so they let down for her a string and she tied thereto a letter whose purport was the following: ""from the terriblest of tribulations  and the chiefest of all calamities, zat al-dawahi, to king afridun greeting. but afterwards, of a truth i have contrived a device for destroying the moslems; so bide ye quiet and content. i have cozened and captured their sultan and the wazir dandan; and then i returned to their camp and acquainted them therewith, whereby their pride had a fall and their withers were wrung. and i have so wrought upon the host 'leaguering constantinople that they have sent ten thousand men under the emir tarkash to succour the capitves, of whom there be now left but few; it is therefore my object that ye sally forth against them with all your power while this day endureth; and that ye fall on them in their tents and that ye leave them not till ye shall have slain them to the last man; for, verily the messiah looketh down upon you and the blessed virgin favoureth you; and i hope of the messiah that he forget not what deed i have done."" when her letter came to king afridun, he rejoiced with great joyance; and, sending at once for king hardub of greece, son of zat al-dawahi, read the letter to him as soon as he came,whereathe was exceeding glad and said, ""see my mother's craft; verily it dispenseth with swords, and her aspect standeth in stead of the terrors of the day of dread."" rejoined afridun, ""may the messiah not bereave us of thy venerable parent nor deprive her of her wile and guile!"" then he bade the knights give orders for sallying outside the city, and the news was noised abroad in constantinople. so the nazarenes and the cohorts of the cross burst forth and unsheathed their keen sabres in their numbers, shouting out their professions of impiety and heresies, and blaspheming the lord of all creatures. when the chamberlain saw the sally, he said, ""behold, the greek is upon us and they surely have learned that our sultan is far away; and haply they have attacked us, for that the most part of our troops have marched to the succour of king zau al-makan!"" therewith he waxed wroth and cried out, ""ho, soldiers of al-islam and favourers of the true faith, an you flee you are lost, but if ye stand fast, ye win! know ye that valiancy lieth in endurance of outrance and that no case is so strait but that the almighty is able to make it straight; allah assain you and look upon you with eyes of compassion fain!"" thereupon the moslems cried out, ""allaho akbar!"" and the believer in the one god shouted his slogan, and whirled the mill wheels of fight with cutting and thrusting in main and might; scymitars and spears played sore and the plains and valleys were swamped with gore. the priests and monks priested it, tight girding their girdles and uplifting the crucifixes, while the moslem shouted out the professions of the requiting king and verses of the koran began to sing. the hosts of the compassion are one fought against the legions of satan; and head flew from body of man, while the good angels hovered above the people of the chosen prophet, nor did the sword cease to smite till the day darkened and night came on and starkened. now the miscreants had encompassed the moslems and made sure of escaping the pains that awaited them; and the faithless greeded for victory over the faithful until day dawned and dazzled. there upon the chamberlain mounted, he and his men, trusting thee allah would help them to victory; and host was mingled with host and battle rose a foot and took post. and heads flew from trunks whilst the brave stood fast in stead; the craven turned tail and fled; and the judge of death judged and sentence sped, so that the champions fell from their saddles slain and corpses cumbered meadow and plain. then the moslem began to give ground and rearwards bent; and the greek took possession of some of their tents; whereupon the moslems were about to break and retreat and take flight, when meanwhile behold, up came sharrkan with the rest of the host of al-islam and the standards of the believers in unity. and having come up with them, he charged the infidels; and followed him zau al-makan and the wazir dandan and the emirs bahram and rustam with his brother tarkash. when the foe saw this, they lost head and their reason fled, and the dust clouds towered till they covered the country whilst the righteous believers joined their pious comrades. then sharrkan accosted the chamberlain and praised him for his steadfastness; and he in turn gave the prince joy of his timely succour and his gaining the day. thereat the moslems were glad and their hearts were heartened; so they rushed upon their enemies and devoted themselves to allah in their fight for the faith. but when the idolaters beheld the standards mohammedan and there on the profession of faith islamitan, proclaiming the unity, they shrieked ""woe!"" and ""ruin!"" and besought succour of the patriarchs of the monasteries. then fell they to calling upon john and mary and the cross abhorrent and stayed their hands from slaughter, whilst king afridun went up to consult king hardub of greece, for the two kings stood one at the head of each wing, right and left. now there was with them also a famous cavalier, lawiya highs, who commanded the centre; and they drew out in battle array, but indeed they were full of alarm and affray. meanwhile, the moslems aligned their forces and thereupon sharrkan came to his brother, zau al-makan, and said, ""o king of the age, doubtless they mean to champion it, and that is also the object of our desire; but it is my wish to push forward the stoutest hearted of our fighters, for by forethought is one half of life wrought."" replied the sultan, ""as thou wilt, o companion of good counsel!"" ""it is my wish,"" added sharrkan, ""to stand in mid line opposite the infidel, with the wazir dandan on my left and thee on my right, whilst the emir bahram leads the dexter wing and the emir rustam leads the wing sinistral; and thou, o mighty king, shalt be under the standards and the ensigns, for that thou art the pillar of our defence; upon thee, after allah, is our dependence and we will all be thy ransom from aught that can harm thee."" zau al-makan thanked him therefor, and the slogan arose and the sabre was drawn; but, as things stood thus, behold, there came forth a cavalier from the ranks of roum; and, as he drew near, they saw that he was mounted on a slow paced she mule, fleeing with her master from the shock of swords. her housings were of white silk covered by a prayer-carpet of cash mere stuff, and on her back sat a shaykh, an old man of comely presence and reverend aspect, garbed in a gown of white wool. he stinted not pushing her and hurrying her on till he came near the moslem and said, ""i am an ambassador to you all, and an ambassador hath naught to do save to deliver; so give me safe conduct and permit of speech, that i communicate to you my message."" replied sharrkan, ""thou art in safety: fear neither sway of sword nor lunge of lance."" thereupon the old man dismounted and, taking the cross from his neck, placed it before the sultan and humbled himself with much humility. then quoth to him the moslems, ""what is with thee of news?""; and quoth he, ""i am an ambassador from king afridun, for i counselled him to avert the destruction of all these frames of men and temples of the compassionate one; and to him it seemed righteous to stay the shedding of blood and limit it to the encounter of two knights in shock of fight singular; so he agreed to that and he saith to you, 'verily, i will ransom my army with my life; so let the moslem king do as i do and with his life ransom his host. and if he kill me, there will be no stay left in the army of roum, and if i kill him, there will be no stability with the moslems."" when sharrkan heard this he said, ""o monk, i agree to that, for it is just nor may it be gainsaid; and behold, i will meet him in duello and do with him derring do, for i am champion of the faithful even as he is champion of the faithless; and if he slay me, he will have won the day and naught will remain for the moslems forces save flight. so return to him, o thou monk, and say that the single combat shall take place to morrow, for this day we have come off our journey and are aweary; but after rest neither reproach nor blame fear ye."" so the monk returned (and he rejoicing) to king afridun and king hardub, and told them both what sharrkan had said, whereat king afridun was glad with exceeding gladness and fell from him anxiety and sadness, and he said to himself, ""no doubt but this sharrkan is their doughtiest swayer of the sword and the dourest at lunge of lance; and when i shall have slain him, their hearts will be disheartened and their strength will be shattered."" now zat al-dawahi had written to king afridun of that and had told him how sharrkan was a knight of the braves and the bravest of knights and had warned him against him; but afridun was a stalwart cavalier who fought in many a fashion; he could hurl rocks and throw spears and smite with the iron mace and he feared not the prowess of the prow. so when he heard the report of the monk that sharrkan agreed to the duello, he was like to fly for exceeding joy because he had self confidence and he knew that none could with stand him. the infidels passed that night in joy and jubilee and wine bibbing; and, as soon as it was dawn, the two armies drew out with the swart of spear and the blanch of blade. and behold a cavalier rode single handed into the plain, mounted on a steed of purest strain, and for foray and fray full ready and fain. and that knight had limbs of might and he was clad in an iron cuirass made for stress of fight. on his breast he wore a jewelled mirror and in his hand he bore a keen scymitar and his lance of khalanj wood,  the curious work of the frank, weighing a quintal. then the rider uncovered his face and cried out, saying, ""whoso knoweth me verily hath enough of me, and whoso knoweth me not right soon  shall ken who i be. i am afridun the overwhelmed by the well omened shawáhi,  zat al-dawahi."" but he had not ended speaking ere sharrkan, the champion of the moslems, fared forth to meet him, mounted on a sorrel horse worth a thousand pieces of red gold with accoutrements purfled in pearls and precious stone; and he bore in baldrick a blade of watered indian steel that through necks shore and made easy the hard and sore. he crave his charger between the two hosts in line whilst the horsemen all fixed on him their eyne, and he cried out to afridun, ""woe to thee, o accursed! dost thou deem me one of the horsemen thou hast overta'en who cannot stand against thee on battle plain?"" then each rushed upon other and they bashed together like two mountains crashing or two billows dash ing and clashing: they advanced and retreated; and drew together and withdrew; and stinted not of fray and fight and weapon play, and strife and stay, with stroke of sword and lunge of lance. of the two armies looking on, some said, ""sharrkan is victor!"" and others, ""afridun will conquer!""; and the two riders stayed not their hands from the hustle until ceased the clamour and the bustle; and the dust columns rose and the day waned and the sun waxed yellow and wan. then cried out king afridun to sharrkan, saying, ""by the truth of the messiah and the faith which is no liar, thou art nought save a doughty rider and a stalwart fighter; but thou art fraudful and thy nature is not that of the noble. i ken thy work is other than praiseworthy nor is thy prowess that of a prince; for thy people behave to thee as though thou wert a slave;  and see! they bring thee out a charger which is not thine, that thou mayst mount and return to the fight. but by the truth of my faith, thy fighting irketh and fatigueth me and i am weary of cutting and thrusting with thee; and if thou purpose to lay on load with me to night, thou wouldst not change aught of thy harness nor thy horse, till thou approve to the cavaliers, thy generous blood and skill in brunt."" when sharrkan heard him say these words concerning his own folk behaving to him though he were a slave, he waxt wroth and turned towards his men, meaning to sign to them and bid them not prepare him change of harness or horse, when lo! afridun shook his throw spear high in air and cast it at sharrkan. now when the moslem turned his back, he found none of the men near him, and he knew this to be a trick of the accursed infidel; so he wheeled round in haste and behold, the javelin came at him, so he swerved from it, till his head was bent low as his saddle bow. the weapon grazed his breast, and pierced the skin of his chest, for sharrkan was high bosomed: whereupon he gave one cry and swooned away. thereat the accursed afridun was joyful, thinking he had slain him; and shouted to the infidels bidding them rejoice, whereat the faithless were encouraged and the faithful wept. when zau al-makan saw his brother reeling in selle so that he well nigh fell, he despatched cavaliers towards him and the braves hurried to his aid and came up with him. thereupon the infidels drove at the moslems; the two hosts joined battle and the two lines were mingled, whilst the keen scymitar of al-yaman did good work. now the first to reach sharrkan was the wazir dandan,—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the one hundred and third night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when king zau al-makan saw that the accursed infidel had struck with javelin his brother sharrkan, he deemed him dead, and despatched cavaliers towards him; and the first to reach him were the wazir dandan and the emir of the turks, bahram, and the emir of the daylamites, rustam. they found him falling from his horse; so they stayed him in his saddle and returned with him to his brother, zau al-makan; then they gave him in charge to his pages, and went again to do the work of cut and thrust. so the strife redoubled and the weapons together clashed and ceased not bate and debate and naught was to be seen but blood flowing and necks bowing; nor did the swords cease on the napes of men to make play nor the strife to rage with more and more affray, till the most part of the night was past away and the two hosts were aweary of the mellay. so they called a truce and each army returned to its tents, whilst all the infidels repaired to king afridun and kissed the ground before him, and the priests and monks wished him joy of his victory over sharrkan. then the king fared for constantinople and sat upon the throne of his realm, when king hardub came to him and said, ""may the messiah strengthen thy fore arm and never cease to be thy helper and hearken to what prayers my pious mother, zat al-dawahi, shall pray for thee! know that the moslems can make no stay without sharrkan."" replied afridun, ""to morrow shall end the affair when to fight i fare: i will seek zau al-makan and slay him, and their army shall turn tail and of flight shall avail."" such was the case with the kafirs; but as regards the host of al-islam, when zau al-makan returned to his tent, he thought of naught but his brother and, going into the pavilion, found him in evil case and sore condition; whereupon he summoned for counsel the wazir dandan and rustam and bahram. when they entered, they opined to assemble the physicians that they might medicine sharrkan, and they wept and said, ""the world will not readily afford his like!"" and they watched by him all that night, and about the later hours came to them the recluse in tears. when zau al-makan saw him, he rose in honour; and the religious stroked sharrkan's wound with his hand, chanting somewhat of the koran and repeating by way of talisman some of the verses of the compassionate one. and the pretender ceased not to watch over him till dawn, when he came to himself and, opening his eyes, moved his tongue in his mouth and spake. at this zau al-makan rejoiced, saying, ""of a truth the blessing of the holy man hath taken effect on him!"" and sharrkan said, ""praised be allah for recovery; indeed, i am well at this hour. that accursed one played me false; and, but that i swerved aside lighter than lightening, the throw spear had pierced through my breast. so praised be allah for saving me! and how is it with the moslems?"" answered zau al-makan, ""all are weeping for thee."" quoth sharrkan, ""i am well and in good case; but where is the holy man?"" now he was sitting by him and said, ""at thy head."" so the prince turned to him and kissed his hand when he said, ""o my son! be of good patience and allah shall increase thy reward; for the wage is measured by the work."" sharrkan rejoined, ""pray for me,"" and he prayed for him. as soon as morning dawned and day brake in shine and sheen, the moslems sallied out to the plain and the kafirs made ready to thrust and cut. then the islamite host advanced and offered fight with weapons ready dight, and king zau al-makan and afridun made to charge one at other. but when zau al-makan fared forth into the field, there came with him the wazir dandan and the chamberlain and bahram, saying, ""we will be thy sacrifice."" he replied, ""by the holy house and zemzem and the place!  i will not be stayed from going forth against these wild asses."" and when he rode out into the field he played with sword and spear till riders marvelled and both armies wondered; then he rushed upon the foe's right wing and of it slew two knights and in like manner he dealt with the left wing. presently he stayed his steed in the midst of the field and cried out, ""where is afridun, that i may make him taste the cup of disgrace?"" but when king hardub saw the case he conjured afridun not to attack him, saying, ""o king, yesterday it was thy turn to fight: it is mine to day. i care naught for his prowess."" so he rushed out towards zau al-makan brand in hand and under him a stallion like abjar, which was antar's charger and its coat was jet black even as saith the poet,  ""on the glancing racer outracing glance * he speeds, as though he             would collar doom: his steed's black coat is of darkest jet, * and likest night in             her nightliest gloom: whose neigh sounds glad to the hearer's ears * like thunders              rolling in thun d'rous boom: if he race the wind he will lead the way, * and the lightning              flash will behind him loom.''   then each rushed upon the opponent, parrying blows and proving the marvellous qualities were stored in him; and they fell to drawing on and withdrawing till the breasts of the bystanders were straitened and they were weary of waiting for the event. at last zau al-makan cried out his war cry and rushed upon hardub, king of cæsarea,  and struck him a stroke that shore head from trunk and slew him on the spot. when the infidels saw this, they charged in a body, compact and united, upon zau al-makan, who met them amidfield, and they engaged in hewing and foining, till blood ran in rills. then the moslems cried out, ""allaho akbar!"" (god is most great) and ""there is no god but the god!"", and invoked salvation for the prophet, the bringer of glad tidings, the bearer of bad tidings. and there befel a great fight, but allah assigned victory to the faithful and defeat to the faithless. the wazir dandan shouted, ""take your blood revenge for king omar bin al nu'uman and his son sharrkan!""; and bared his head and cried out to the turks. now there were by his side more than twenty thousand horse, and all charged with him as men, when the faithless found naught to save their lives but flight. so they turned tail to fly while the biting sabre wrought its havoc and the moslems slew of them that day some fifty thousand horse and took more than that number: much folk also were slain while going in at the gates, for the flock was great. then the greeks hove to the doors and swarmed up the walls to await the assault; and in fine the moslem hosts returned to their tents aided to glory and victory, and king zau al-makan went in to his brother whom he found in most joyous case. so he made a prostration of thanks to the bountiful and the exalted; and then he came forward and gave sharrkan joy of his recovery. answered he, ""verily we are all under the benediction of this religious, holy and righteous, nor would you have been victorious, but for his accepted orisons; indeed all day he remained at prayer to invoke victory on the moslems.""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the one hundred and fourth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when zau al- makan went in to his brother sharrkan, he found him sitting with the holy man by his side; so he rejoiced and drew near him and gave him joy of his recovery. answered he, ""verily we are all under the benediction of this recluse nor would you have been victorious but for his prayers, indeed he felt no fear this day and he ceased not supplication for the moslems. i found strength return to me, when i heard your 'allaho akbar,' for then i knew you to be victorious over your enemies. but now recount to me, o my brother, what befel thee."" so he told him all that had passed between him and the accursed hardub and related how he had slain him and sent him to the malediction of allah; and sharrkan praised him and thanked him for his prowess. when zat al-dawahi heard tell of her son's death (and she still drest as a devotee), her face waxed yellow and her eyes ran over with railing tears: she kept her counsel, however, and feigned to the moslems that she was glad and wept for excess of joy. but she said to herself, ""by the truth of the messiah, there remaineth no profit of my life, if i burn not his heart for his brother, sharrkan, even as he hath burned my heart for king hardub, the mainstay of christendom and the hosts of crossdom!"" still she kept her secret. and the wazir dandan and king zau al-makan and the chamberlain remained sitting with sharrkan till they had dressed and salved his wound; after which they gave him medicines and he began to recover strength; whereat they joyed with exceeding joy and told the troops who congratulated themselves, saying, ""to morrow he will ride with us and do manly devoir in the siege."" then said sharrkan to them, ""ye have fought through all this day and are aweary of fight; so it behoveth that you return to your places and sleep and not sit up."" they accepted his counsel and then each went away to his own pavilion, and none remained with sharrkan but a few servants and the old woman zat al-dawahi. he talked with her through part of the night, then he stretched himself to rest: and his servants did likewise and presently sleep overcame them all and they lay like the dead. such was the case with sharrkan and his men; but as regards the old woman she alone abode awake while they slumbered in the tent and, looking at sharrkan she presently saw that he was drowned in sleep. thereupon she sprang to her feet, as she were a scald she bear or a speckled snake, and drew from her waist cloth a dagger so poisoned that if laid thereon it would have melted a rock. then she unsheathed the poniard and went up to sharrkan's head and she drew the knife across his throat and severed his weasand and hewed off his head from his body. and once more she sprang to her feet; and, going the round of the sleeping servants, she cut off their heads also, lest they should awake. then she left the tent and made for the sultan's pavilion, but finding the guards on the alert, turned to that of the wazir dandan. now she found him reading the koran and when his sight fell upon her he said, ""welcome to the holy man!"" hearing this from the wazir, her heart trembled and she said, ""the reason of my coming hither at this time is that i heard the voice of a saint amongst allah's saints and am going to him."" then she turned her back, but the wazir said to himself, ""by allah, i will follow our devotee this night!"" so he rose and walked after her; but when the accursed old woman sensed his footsteps, she knew that he was following her: wherefore she feared the disgrace of discovery and said in herself, ""unless i serve some trick upon him he will disgrace me."" so she turned and said to him from afar, ""ho, thou wazir, i am going in search of this saint that i may learn who he is; and, after learning this much, i will ask his leave for thee to visit him. then i will come back and tell thee: for i fear thine accompanying me, without having his permission, lest he take umbrage at me seeing thee in my society."" now when the wazir heard these words, he was ashamed to answer her; so he left her and returned to his tent, and would have slept; but sleep was not favourable to him and the world seemed heaped upon him. presently he rose and went forth from the tent saying in himself, ""i will go to sharrkan and chat with him till morning."" but when he entered into sharrkan's pavilion, he found the blood running like an aqueduct and saw the servants lying with their throats cut like beasts for food. at this he cried a cry which aroused all who were asleep; the folk hastened to him and, seeing the blood streaming, set up a clamour of weeping and wailing. then the noise awoke the sultan, who enquired what was the matter, and it was said to him, ""sharrkan thy brother and his servants are murthered."" so he rose in haste and entered the tent, and found the wazir dandan shrieking aloud and he saw his brother's body without a head. thereat he swooned away and all the troops crowded around him, weeping and crying out, and so remained for a while, till he came to himself, when he looked at sharrkan and wept with sore weeping, while the wazir and rustam and bahram did the like. but the chamberlain cried and lamented more than the rest and asked leave to absent himself, such was his alarm. then said zau al-makan, ""know ye who did this deed and how is it i see not the devotee, him who the things of this world hath put away?"" quoth the wazir, ""and who should have been the cause of this affliction, save that devotee, that satan? by allah, my heart abhorred him from the first, because i know that all who pretend to be absorbed in practices religious are vile and treacherous!"" and he repeated to the king the tale of how he would have followed the religious, but he forbade him, whereupon the folk broke out into a tumult of weeping and lamentation and humbled themselves before him who is ever near, him who ever answereth prayer, supplicating that he would cause the false devotee who denied allah's testimony to fall into their hands. then they laid sharrken out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues.—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the one hundred and fifth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that they laid sharrkan out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues. then they looked for the opening of the city gate; but it opened not and no sign of men appeared to them on the walls; whereat they wondered with exceeding wonder. but king zau al-makan said, ""by allah, i will not turn back from them, though i sit here for years and years, till i take blood revenge for my brother sharrkan and waste constantinople and kill the king of the nazarenes, even if death overcome me and i be at rest from this woeful world!"" then he bade be brought out the treasure taken from the monastery of matruhina; and mustered the troops and divided the monies among them, and he left not one of them but he gave him gifts which contented him. moreover, he assembled in the presence three hundred horse of every division and said to them, ""do ye send supplies to your households, for i am resolved to abide by this city, year after year, till i have taken man bote for my brother sharrkan, even if i die in this stead."" and when the army heard these words and had received his gifts of money they replied, ""to hear is to obey!"" thereupon he summoned couriers and gave them letters and charged them to deliver the same, together with the monies, to the soldiers' families and inform them that all were safe and satisfied, and acquaint them saying, ""we are encamped before constantinople and we will either destroy it or die; and, albeit we be obliged to abide here months and years, we will not depart hence till we take it."" moreover, he bade the wazir dandan write to his sister, nuzhat al-zaman, and said to him, ""acquaint her with what hath befallen us, and what be our situation and commend my child to her care since that, when i went out to war, my wife was near her delivery and by this time she must needs have been brought to bed; and if she hath given birth to a boy, as i have heard say, hasten your return and bring me the acceptable news."" then he gave them somewhat of money, which they pouched and set out at once; and all the people flocked forth to take leave of them and entrust them with the monies and the messages. after they had departed, zau al-makan turned to the wazir dandan and commanded him to advance with the army against the city walls. so the troops pushed forward, but found none on the ramparts, whereat they marvelled, while zau al-makan was troubled at the case, for he deeply mourned the severance from his brother sharrkan and he was sore perturbed about that traitor the ascetic. in this condition they abode three days without seeing anyone. so far concerning the moslems; but as regards the greeks and the cause of their refusing to fight during these three days the case was this. as soon as zat al-dawahi had slain sharrkan, she hastened her march and reached the walls of constantinople, where she called out in the greek tongue to the guards to throw her down a rope. quoth they, ""who art thou?""; and quoth she, ""i am zat al- dawahi."" they knew her and let down a cord to which she tied herself and they drew her up; and, when inside the city, she went in to the king afridun and said to him, ""what is this i hear from the moslems? they say that my son king hardub is slain."" he answered, ""yes;"" and she shrieked out and wept right grievously and ceased not weeping thus till she made afridun and all who were present weep with her. then she told the king how she had slain sharrkan and thirty of his servants, whereat he rejoiced and thanked her; and, kissing her hands, exhorted her to resignation for the loss of her son. said she, ""by the truth of the messiah, i will not rest content with killing that dog of the moslem dogs in blood revenge for my son, a king of the kings of the age! now there is no help for it but that i work some guile and i contrive a wile whereby to slay the sultan zau al-makan and the wazir dandan and the chamberlain and rustam and bahram and ten thousand cavaliers of the army of al-islam; for it shall never be said that my son's head be paid with the bloodwit of sharrkan's head; no, never!"" then said she to king afridun, ""know, o king of the age, that it is my wish to set forth mourning for my son and to cut my girdle and to break the crosses."" replied afridun, ""do what thou desire; i will not gainsay thee in aught. and if thou prolong thy mourning for many days it were a little thing; for though the moslems resolve to beleaguer us years and years, they will never win their will of us nor gain aught of us save trouble and weariness."" then the accursed one (when she had ended with the calamity she had wrought and the ignominies which in herself she had thought) took ink case and paper and wrote thereon: ""from shawahi, zat al- dawahi, to the host of the moslems. know ye that i entered your country and duped by my cunning your nobles and at first hand i slew your king omar bin al-nu'uman in the midst of his palace. moreover, i slew, in the affair of the mountain pass and of the cave, many of your men; and the last i killed were sharrkan and his servants. and if fortune do not stay me and satan obey me, i needs must slay me your sultan and the wazir dandan, for i am she who came to you in disguise of a recluse and who heaped upon you my devices and deceits. wherefore, an you would be in safety after this, fare ye forth at once; and if you seek your own destruction cease not abiding for the nonce; and though ye tarry here years and years, ye shall not do your desire on us. and so peace be yours!"" after writing her writ she devoted three days to mourning for king hardub; arid, on the fourth, she called a knight and bade him take the letter and make it fast to a shaft and shoot it into the moslem camp. when this was done, she entered the church and gave herself up to weeping and wailing for the loss of her son, saying to him who took the kingship after him, ""nothing will serve me but i must kill zau al-makan and all the nobles of al-islam."" such was the case with her; but as regards what occurred to the moslems, all passed three days in trouble and anxiety, and on the fourth when gazing at the walls behold, they saw a knight holding a bow and about to shoot an arrow along whose side a letter was bound. so they waited till he had shot it among them and the sultan bade the wazir dandan take the missive and read it. he perused it accordingly; and, when zau al-makan heard it to end and understood its purport, his eyes filled with tears and he shrieked for agony at her perfidy; and the minister dandan said, ""by allah, my heart shrank from her!"" quoth the sultan, ""how could this whore play her tricks upon us twice? but by the almighty i will not depart hence till i fill her cleft with molten lead and jail her with the jailing of a bird encaged, then bind her with her own hair and crucify her over the gate of constantinople."" and he called to mind his brother and wept with excessive weeping. but when zat al-dawahi arrived amongst the infidels and related to them her adventures at length, they rejoiced at her safety and at the slaying of sharrkan. there upon the moslems addressed themselves again to the siege of the city and the sultan promised his men that, if it should be taken, he would divide its treasures among them in equal parts. but he dried not his tears grieving for his brother till his body was wasted and sick, growing thin as a tooth pick. presently the wazir dandan came in to him and said, ""be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; in very sooth thy brother died not but because his hour was come, and there is no profit in this mourning. how well saith the poet,  ""whatso is not to be no sleight shall bring to pass; * what is to              be without a failure shall become; soon the becoming fortune shall be found to be, * and folly's              brother  shall abide forlorn and glum.""  wherefore do thou leave this weeping and wailing and hearten thy heart to bear arms."" he replied, ""o wazir, my heart is heavy for the death of my father and my brother and for our absence from hearth and home; and my mind is concerned for my subjects."" thereupon the wazir and the bystanders wept; but they ceased not from pushing forward the siege of constantinople for a length of days. and they being thus, behold, news arrived from baghdad, by one of the emirs to the effect that the king's wife had been blessed with a boy, and that his sister, nuzhat al-zaman, had named him kánmákán.  moreover, that the boy bid fair to be famous, already showing wondrous signs and marvellous tokens; and that she had commanded the olema and the preachers to pray for mother and child from the pulpits and bless them in all wise; furthermore that the twain were well, that the land had enjoyed abundant rains, and that his comrade the fireman was established in all prosperity, with eunuchs and slaves to wait upon him; but that he was still ignorant of what had befallen him. and she ended with the greeting of peace. then quoth zau al- makan to the wazir dandan, ""now is my back strengthened for that i have been blest with a son whose name is kanmakan.""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.  when it was the one hundred and sixth night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when they brought him the news of his wife having borne him a boy child, zau al- makan rejoiced with great joy and cried, ""now is my back strengthened, for that i have been blessed with a son  whose name is kanmakan."" and he spake to the wazir dandan, saying, ""i am minded to leave this mourning and order perfections of the koran for my brother and command almsdeeds on his account."" quoth the wazir, ""thy design is good."" thereupon he caused tents to be pitched over his brother's tomb; so they raised them and gathered together such of the men at arms as could repeat the koran; and some began reciting the holy volume; whilst others chanted litanies containing the names of allah, and thus they did till the morning. then zau al-makan went up to the grave of his brother sharrkan and poured forth copious tears, and improvised these couplets,  ""they bore him bier'd, and all who followed wept * with moses'          shrieks what day o'erhead shook tor;  till reached the grave which pate had made his home, * dug in            men's souls who one sole god adore: ne'er had i thought before to see my joy * borne on the bier            which heads of bearers bore: ah no! nor ere they homed thee in the dust * that stars of            heaven earth ever covered o'er. is the tomb dweller hostage of a stead, * where light and             splendour o'er thy face shall pour? praise to restore his life her word hath pledged: * cribbed and            confined he shall dispread the more!""  when zau al-makan had made an end of his versifying he wept and wept with him all the troops; then he came to the grave and threw himself upon it wild with woe, and the wazir repeated the words of the poet,  ""pain leaving life that fleets thou hast th' eternal won; * thou             didst as whilom many a doer like thee hath done leftest this worldly house without reproach or blame; * ah, may             th' ex change secure thee every benison! thou west from hostile onset shield and firm defence, * for us to             baffle shafts and whistling spears to shun. i see this world is only cheat and vanity, * where man naught            else must seek but please the truthful one: th' empyrean's lord allow thee bower of heavenly bliss, * and wi'             thy faithful friends the guide show goodly wone: i bid thee last good e'en with sigh of bitter grief, * seeing the              west in woe for lack of easting sun.""   when the wazir dandan had finished his reciting, he wept with sore weeping and the tears rained from his eyes like cushioned pearls. then came forward one who had been of sharrkan's boon companions in his cups and he wept till ran in rills the drops, and he enumerated the dead man's generous qualities, reciting the following pentastichs,   ""where gone is bounty since thy hand is turned to clay? * and i              in misery lie since thou west ta'en away. see'st not, o litter guide  (heaven keep thee glad and              gay!), * how tears adorn my cheeks, these furrowed wrinkles              fray?                         a sight to joy shine eyes and fill thee with                         dismay.  by allah ne'er this heart within i spoke of thee; * ah no! nor              dared my sight to see thy brilliancy: save that my tear drops sorest wound have garred me dree * yea!              and if e'er on other rest these eyne of me,                         may yearning draw their reins nor suffer sleep to see.""   and when the man stinted reciting, zau al-makan and the minister dandan wept and the whole army was moved to tears; after which all retired to their tents, and the king turning to the wazir took counsel with him concerning the conduct of the campaign. on this wise the two passed days and nights, while zau al-makan was weighed down with grief and mourning till at last he said, ""i long to hear stories and adventures of kings and tales of lover folk enslaved by love; haply allah may make this to solace that which is on my heart of heavy anxiety, and stint and stay my weeping and wailing."" quoth the wazir, ""if naught can dispel thy trouble but hearing curious tales of kings and people long gone before and stories of folk enslaved by love of yore, and so forth, this thing were easy, for i had no other business, in the lifetime of thy father (who hath found mercy) than to relate stories and to repeat verses to him. this very night i will tell thee a tale of a lover and his beloved, so shall thy breast be broadened."" when zau al-makan heard these words from the minister, his heart was set upon that which had been promised to him and he did nothing but watch for the coming of the night, that he might hear what the wazir dandan had to tell of the kings of yore and distracted lovers long gone before. and hardly would he believe that night had fallen ere he bade light the wax candles and the lamps and bring all that was needful of meat and drink and perfume gear, and what not; and when all was in presence, he summoned the wazir dandan, and the emirs rustam and bahram and tarkash and the grand chamberlain; then waited till the whole party was seated before him; whereupon he turned to the minister and said, ""know, o wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us."" replied the wazir, ""with joy and good will.""—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.  when it was the one hundred and seventh night,  she said, it hath reached me, o auspicious king, that when king zau al-makan summoned the wazir and the chamberlain and rustam and bahram, he turned towards the minister dandan and said, ""know, o wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us."" replied the wazir, ""with love and gladness! know, o auspicious king, that there reached my ears a relation of a lover and a loved one and of the discourse between them and what befel them of things rare and fair, a story such as repelleth care from the heart and dispelleth sorrow like unto that of the patriarch jacob ; and it is as follows"":  footnotes:     this knightly tale, the longest in the nights (xliv.— cxlv.), about one-eighth of the whole, does not appear in the bres. edit. lane, who finds it ""objectionable,"" reduces it to two of its episodes, azíz-cum-azízah and táj al-mulúk. on the other hand it has been converted into a volume (8vo, pp. 240) ""scharkan, conte arabe,"" etc. traduit par m. asselan riche, etc. paris: dondey-dupré. 1829. it has its longueurs and at times is longsome enough; but it is interesting as a comparison between the chivalry of al-islam and european knight-errantry. although all the characters are fictitious the period is evidently in the early crusading days. cæsarea, the second capital of palestine, taken during the caliphate of omar (a.h. 19) and afterwards recovered, was fortified in a.h. 353 = 963 as a base against the arabs by the emperor phocas, the arab. ""nakfúr"" i.e. nicephorus. in a.h. 498=1104, crusading craft did much injury by plundering merchantmen between egypt and syria, to which allusion is found in the romance. but the story teller has not quite made up his mind about which cæsarea he is talking, and m. riche tells us that césarée is a ""ville de la mauritanie, en afrique"" (p. 20).    the fifth ommiade caliph reign. a.h. 65-86 = 685-704.    this does not merely mean that no one was safe from his wrath: or, could approach him in the heat of fight: it is a reminiscence of the masterful ""king kulayb,"" who established game-laws in his dominions and would allow no man to approach his camp-fire. moreover the jinn lights a fire to decoy travellers, but if his victim be bold enough to brave him, he invites him to take advantage of the heat.    china.    the jaxartes and the bactrus (names very loosely applied).    in full ""sharrun kána"" i.e. an evil (sharr) has come to being (kána) that is, ""bane to the foe"" a pagan and knightly name. the hero of the romance ""al-dalhamah"" is described as a bitter gourd (colocynth), a viper, a calamity.    this is a moslem law (koran chaps. iv. bodily borrowed from the talmud) which does not allow a man to marry one wife unless he can carnally satisfy her. moreover he must distribute his honours equally and each wife has a right to her night unless she herself give it up. this was the case even with the spouses of the prophet; and his biography notices several occasions when his wives waived their rights in favour of one another m. riche kindly provides the king with la piquante francaise (p. 15).    so the celebrated mosque in stambul, famed for being the largest church in the world is known to the greeks as ""agia (pron. aya) sophia"" and to moslems as ""aye sofíyeh"" (holy wisdom) i.e. the logos or second person of the trinity (not a saintess). the sending a christian girl as a present to a moslem would, in these days, be considered highly scandalous. but it was done by the mukaukis or coptic governor of egypt (under heraclius) who of course hated the greeks. this worthy gave two damsels to mohammed; one called sírín and the other máriyah (maria) whom the prophet reserved for his especial use and whose abode is still shown at al-medinah. the rev. doctor badger (loc. cit. p. 972) gives the translation of an epistle by mohammed to this mukaukis, written in the cufic character ( ? ?) and sealed ""mohammed, the apostle of allah."" my friend seems to believe that it is an original, but upon this subject opinions will differ. it is, however, exceedingly interesting, beginning with ""bismillah,"" etc., and ending (before the signature) with a quotation from the koran (iii. 57); and it may be assumed as a formula addressee to foreign potentates by a prophet who had become virtually ""king of arabia.""    this prayer before ""doing the deed of kind"" is, i have said, moslem as well christian.    exodus i. 16, quoted by lane (m. e., chaps. xxvii.). torrens in his notes cites drayton's ""moon-calf':—             bring forth the birth-stool—no, let it alone;             she is so far beyond all compass grown,             some other new device us needs must stead,             or else she never can be brought to bed. it is the ""groaning-chair"" of poor robin's almanac (1676) and we find it alluded to in boccaccio, the classical sedile which according to scoffers has formed the papal chair (a curule seat) ever since the days of pope joan, when it has been held advisable for one of the cardinals to ascertain that his holiness possesses all the instruments of virility. this ""kursí al-wiládah"" is of peculiar form on which the patient is seated. a most interesting essay might be written upon the various positions preferred during delivery, e.g. the wild irish still stand on all fours, like the so-called ""lower animals."" amongst the moslems of waday, etc., a cord is hung from the top of the hut, and the woman in labour holds on to it standing with her legs apart, till the midwife receives the child.    some orientalists call ""lullilooing"" the trilling cry, which is made by raising the voice to its highest pitch and breaking it by a rapid succession of touches on the palate with the tongue-tip, others ""ziraleet"" and zagaleet, and one traveller tells us that it began at the marriage-festival of isaac and rebecca (!). arabs term it classically ""tahlíl"" and vulgarly ""zaghrutah"" (plur. zaghárit) and persians ""kil."" finally in don quixote we have ""lelilies,"" the battle-cry of the moors (duffield iii. 289). dr. buchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds, but the good missionary heard it at the festival of jagannath. (pilgrimage iii. 197 )    i.e. ""light of the place"" (or kingdom) and ""delight of the age.""    it is utterly absurd to give the old heroic persian name afridun or furaydun, the destroyer of zohák or zahhák to a greek, but such anachronisms are characteristic of the nights and are evidently introduced on purpose. see boccaccio, ix. 9.    arab. ""yunán"" lit. ionia, which applies to all greece, insular and continental, especially to ancient greece.    in 1870 i saw at sidon a find of some hundreds of gold ""philippi"" and ""alexanders.""    m. riche has (p. 21), ""ces talismans travaillés par le ciseau du célèbre califaziri,"" adding in a note, ""je pense que c'est un sculpteur arabe.""    this periphrase, containing what seems to us a useless negative, adds emphasis in arabic.    this bit of geographical information is not in the bull edit.    in pers. = a tooth, the popular word.    this preliminary move, called in persian nakl-i safar, is generally mentioned. so the franciscan monks in california, when setting out for a long journey through the desert, marched three times round the convent and pitched tents for the night under its walls.    in arab. ""khazinah"" or ""khaznah"" lit. a treasure, representing 1,000 ""kís"" or purses (each=£5). the sum in the text is 7,000 purses x 5=£35,000.    travellers often prefer such sites because they are sheltered from the wind, and the ground is soft for pitching tents; but many have come to grief from sudden torrents following rain.    arab ""ghábah"" not a forest in our sense of the word, but a place where water sinks and the trees (mostly mimosas), which elsewhere are widely scattered, form a comparatively dense growth and collect in thickets. these are favourite places for wild beasts during noon-heats.    at various times in the east jews and christians were ordered to wear characteristic garments, especially the zunnár or girdle.    the description is borrowed from the coptic convent, which invariably has an inner donjon or keep. the oldest monastery in the world is mar antonios (st. anthony the hermit) not far from suez. (gold mines of midian, p. 85.)    ""dawáhí,"" plur. of dáhiyah = a mishap. the title means ""mistress of misfortunes"" or queen of calamities (to the enemy); and the venerable lady, as will be seen, amply deserved her name, which is pronounced zát al-dawáhí.    arab. ""kunfuz""=hedgehog or porcupine.    these flowers of speech are mere familiarities, not insults. in societies where the sexes are separated speech becomes exceedingly free. ""étourdie que vous êtes,"" says m. riche, toning down the text.    arab. ""zirt,"" a low word. the superlative ""zarrát"" (fartermost) or, ""abu zirt"" (father of farts) is a facetious term among the bean-eating fellahs and a deadly insult amongst the badawin (night ccccx.). the latter prefer the word taggáa (pilgrimage iii. 84). we did not disdain the word in farthingale=pet en air.    arab. ""kicked"" him, i.e. with the sharp corner of the shovel-stirrup. i avoid such expressions as ""spurring"" and ""pricking over the plain,"" because apt to give a wrong idea.    arab. ""allaho akbar!"" the classical moslem slogan.    arab horses are never taught to leap, so she was quite safe on the other side of a brook nine feet broad.    ""batrík"" (vulg. bitrík)=patricius, a title given to christian knights who commanded ten thousand men; the tarkhan (or nobb) heading four thousand, and the kaumas (arab. káid) two hundred. it must not be confounded with batrak (or batrik)=patriarcha. (lane's lex.)    arab. ""kázi al-kuzát,"" a kind of chief justice or chancellor. the office wag established under the rule of harun al rashid, who so entitled abú yúsuf ya'akab al-ansári: therefore the allusion is anachronistic. the same caliph also caused the olema to dress as they do still.    the allusion is koranic: ""o men, if ye be in doubt concerning the resurrection, consider that he first created you of the dust of the ground (adam), afterwards of seed"" (chaps. xxii.). but the physiological ideas of the koran are curious. it supposes that the mani or male semen is in the loins and that of women in the breast bone (chaps ixxxvi.); that the mingled seed of the two (chaps. ixxvi.) fructifies the ovary and that the child is fed through the navel with menstruous blood, hence the cessation of the catamenia. barzoi (kalilah and dímnah) says:— ""man's seed, falling into the woman's womb, is mixed with her seed and her blood: when it thickens and curdles the spirit moves it and it turns about like liquid cheese; then it solidifies, its arteries are formed, its limbs constructed and its joints distinguished. if the babe is a male, his face is placed towards his mother's back; if a female, towards her belly."" (p. 262, mr. l g.n. keith- falconer's translation.) but there is a curious prolepsis of the spermatozoa-theory. we read (koran chaps. vii.), ""thy lord drew forth their posterity from the loins of the sons of adam;"" and the commentators say that allah stroked adam's back and extracted from his loins all his posterity, which shall ever be, in the shape of small ants; these confessed their dependence on god and were dismissed to return whence they came."" from this fiction it appears (says sale) that the doctrine of pre-existence is not unknown to the mohammedans, and there is some little conformity between it and the modern theory of generatio ex animalculis in semine marium. the poets call this yaum-i-alast = the day of am-i-not (-your lord)? which sir william jones most unhappily translated ""art thou not with thy lord ?"" (alasta bi rabbi- kum); fand they produce a grand vision of unembodied spirits appearing in countless millions before their creator.    the usual preliminary of a wrestling bout.    in eastern wrestling this counts as a fair fail. so ajax fell on his back with ulysses on his breast. (iliad xxxii., 700, etc.)    so biting was allowed amongst the greeks in the , the final struggle on the ground.    supposed to be names of noted wrestlers. ""kayim"" (not el-kim as torrens has it) is a term now applied to a juggler or ""professor"" of legerdemain who amuses people in the streets with easy tricks. (lane, m. e., chaps. xx.)    lit. ""laughed in his face"" which has not the unpleasant meaning it bears in english.    arab. ""abu riyáh""=a kind of child's toy. it is our ""bull-roarer"" well known in australia and parts of africa.    the people of the region south of the caspian which is called ""sea of daylam."" it has a long history; for which see d'herbelot, s.v. ""dilem.""    coptic convents in egypt still affect these drawbridges over the keep-moat.    koran iv., xxii. etc., meaning it is lawful to marry women taken in war after the necessary purification although their husbands be still living. this is not permitted with a free woman who is a true believer. i have noted that the only concubine slave-girl mentioned in the koran are these ""captives possessed by the right hand.""    the amazonian dame is a favourite in folk-lore and is an ornament to poetry from the iliad to our modern day. such heroines, apparently unknown to the pagan arabs, were common in the early ages of al-islam as ockley and gibbon prove, and that the race is not extinct may be seen in my pilgrimage (iii. 55) where the sister of ibn rumi resolved to take blood revenge for her brother.    and solomon said, ""o nobles, which of you will bring me her throne ?"" a terrible genius (i.e. an if rit of the jinn named dhakwan or the notorious sakhr) said, "" i will bring it unto thee before thou arise from thy seat (of justice); for i am able to perform it, and may be trusted"" (koran, xxvii. 38-39). balkís or bilkís (says the durrat al-ghawwás) daughter of hozád bin sharhabíl, twenty-second in the list of the rulers of al- yaman, according to some murdered her husband, and became, by moslem ignorance, the biblical "" queen of sheba."" the abyssinians transfer her from arabian saba to ethiopia and make her the mother by solomon of menelek, their proto-monarch; thus claiming for their royalties an antiquity compared with which all reigning houses in the world are of yesterday. the dates of the tabábi'ah or tobbas prove that the bilkis of history ruled al-yaman in the early christian era.    arab. ""fass,"" fiss or fuss; the gem set in a ring; also applied to a hillock rounded en cabochon. in the nights it is used to signify ""a fine gem.""    this prominence of the glutæi muscles is always insisted upon, because it is supposed to promise well in a bed-fellow. in somali land where the people are sub- steatopygous, a rich young man, who can afford such luxury, will have the girls drawn up in line and choose her to wife who projects furthest behind    the ""bull"" is only half mine.    a favourite arab phrase, the ""hot eye"" is one full of tears.    i.e., ""coral,"" coral branch, a favourite name for a slave-girl, especially a negress. it is the older ""morgiana."" i do not see why preston in al-haríni's ""makamah (séance) of singar"" renders it pearls, because golius gives ""small pearls,"" when it is evidently ""coral."" richardson (dissert. xlviii.) seems to me justified in finding the pari (fairy) marjan of heroic persian history reflected in the fairy morgain who earned off king arthur after the battle of camelon.    arab. ""'ud jalaki""=jalak or jalik being a poetical and almost obsolete name of damascus.    the fountain in paradise whose water shall be drunk with ""pure"" wine mixed and sealed with musk (for clay). it is so called because it comes from the ""sanam"" (sanima, to be high) boss or highest ridge of the moslem heaven (koran lv. 78 and lxxxiii. 27). mr. rodwell says ""it is conveyed to the highest apartments in the pavilions of paradise."" (?)    this ""hysterical"" temperament is not rare even amongst the bravest arabs.    an idea evidently derived from the æolipyla (olla animatoria) the invention of hero alexandrinus, which showed that the ancient egyptians could apply the motive force of steam.    kuthayyir ibn abi jumah, a poet and far-famed ráwí or tale-reciter, mentioned by ibn khallikan he lived at al-medinah and sang the attractions of one azzah, hence his soubriquet sáhib (lover of) azzah. as he died in a. h. 105 (=726), his presence here is a gross anachronism the imaginary sharrkan flourished before the caliphate of abd al-malik bin marwán a. h. 65-86.    jamíl bin ma'amar, a poet and lover contemporary with al-kuthayrir.    arab. ""tafazzal,"" a word of frequent use in conversation=""favour me,"" etc.    the word has a long history. from the gr. or is the lat. stibium; while the low latin ""antimonium"" and the span. althimod are by metathesis for al-ithmid. the dictionaries define the substance as a stone from which antimony is prepared, but the arabs understand a semi-mythical mineral of yellow colour which enters into the veins of the eyes and gives them iynx-like vision. the famous anz nicknamed zarká (the blue eyed) of yamámah (province) used it; and, according to some, invented kohl. when her (protohistoric) tribe jadis had destroyed all the rival race of tasm, except ribáh ibn murrah; the sole survivor fled to the tobba of al-yaman, who sent a host to avenge him. the king commanded his himyarites to cut tree-boughs and use them as screens (again birnam wood). zarká from her utum, or peel-tower, saw the army three marches off and cried, ""o folk, either trees or himyar are coming upon you!"" adding, in rajaz verse:—  i swear by allah that trees creep onward, or that himyar beareth somewhat which he draweth along!  she then saw a man mending his sandal. but jadis disbelieved; cassandra was slain and, when her eyes were cut out the vessels were found full of ithmid. hence al-mutanabbi sang:  ""sharper-sighted than zarká of jau"" (yamámah).  see c. de perceval i. 101; arab. prov. i. 192; and chenery p. 381. (the assemblies of al-hariri; london, williams and norgate, 1867). i have made many enquiries into the true nature of ithmid and failed to learn anything: on the upper nile the word is=kohl.    the general colour of chessmen in the east, where the game is played on a cloth more often than a board.    arab. ""al-fil,"" the elephant=the french fol or fou and our bishop. i have derived ""elephant"" from píl (old persian, sansk. pilu) and arab. fil, with the article al-fil, whence the greek the suffix—as being devoted to barbarous words as obod-as (al ubayd), aretas (al-háris), etc. mr. isaac taylor (the alphabet i. 169), preserves the old absurdity of ""eleph-ant or ox-like (!) beast of africa."" prof. sayce finds the word al-ab (two distinct characters) in line 3, above the figure of an (indian) elephant, on the black obelisk of nimrod mound, and suggests an assyrian derivation.    arab. ""shaukat"" which may also mean the ""pride"" or ""mainstay"" (of the army).    lit. ""smote him on the tendons of his neck."" this is the famous shoulder-cut (tawash shuh) which, with the leg-cut (kalam), formed, and still forms, the staple of eastern attack with the sword.    arab. ""dirás."" easterns do not thresh with flails. the material is strewed over a round and smoothed floor of dried mud in the open air and threshed by different connivances. in egypt the favourite is a chair-like machine called ""norag,"" running on iron plates and drawn by bulls or cows over the corn. generally, however, moslems prefer the old classical , the tribulum of virgil and varro, a slipper-shaped sled of wood garnished on the sole with large-headed iron nails, or sharp fragments of flint or basalt. thus is made the ""tibn"" or straw, the universal hay of the east, which our machines cannot imitate.    these numbers appear to be grossly exaggerated, but they were possible in the days of sword and armour: at the battle of saffayn the caliph ali is said to have cut down five hundred and twenty-three men in a single night.    arab. ""bika'á"": hence the ""buka'ah"" or clesyria.    richardson in his excellent dictionary (note 103) which modern priggism finds ""unscientific "" wonderfully derives this word from arab. ""khattáf,"" a snatcher (i.e. of women), a ravisher. it is an evident corruption of ""captivus"" through italian and french    these periodical and fair-like visitations to convents are still customary; especially amongst the christians of damascus.    camphor being then unknown.    the ""wrecker"" is known all over the world; and not only barbarians hold that ships driven ashore become the property of the shore    arab. ""jokh"": it is not a dictionary word, but the only term in popular use for european broadcloth.    the second person plural is used because the writer would involve the subjects of his correspondent in the matter.    this part of the phrase, which may seem unnecessary to the european, is perfectly intelligible to all orientalists. you may read many an eastern letter and not understand it. compare boccacoo iv. 1.    i.e. he was greatly agitated    in text ""li-ajal a al-taudi'a,"" for the purpose of farewelling, a low egyptianism; emphatically a ""kalám wáti."" (pilgrimage thee iii. 330.)    in the mac. edit. sharrkan speaks, a clerical error.    the farsakh (germ. stunde) a measure of time rather than distance, is an hour's travel or its equivalent, a league, a meile=three english stat. miles. the word is still used in persia its true home, but not elsewhere. it is very old, having been determined as a lineal measure of distance by herodotus (ii. 5 and 6 ; v. 53), who computes it at 30 furlongs (=furrow-lengths, 8 to the stat. mile). strabo (xi.) makes it range from 40 to 60 stades (each=606 feet 9 inches), and even now it varies between 1,500 to 6,000 yards. captain francklin (tour to persia) estimates it = about four miles. (pilgrimage ii. 113.)    arab. ""ashhab."" names of colours are few amongst semi civilised peoples, but in arabia there is a distinct word for every shade of horseflesh.    she had already said to him ""thou art beaten in everything!""    showing that she was still a christian.    this is not badawi sentiment: the honoratioren amongst wild people would scorn such foul play; but amongst the settled arabs honour between men and women is unknown and such ""hocussing"" would be held quite fair.    the table of wine, in our day, is mostly a japanned tray with glasses and bottles, saucers of pickles and fruits and, perhaps, a bunch of flowers and aromatic herbs. during the caliphate the ""wine-service"" was on a larger scale.    here the ""bhang"" (almost a generic term applied to hellebore, etc.) may be hyoscyamus or henbane. yet there are varieties of cannabis, such as the dakha of south africa capable of most violent effect. i found the use of the drug well known to the negroes of the southern united states and of the brazil, although few of their owners had ever heard of it.    amongst moslems this is a reference to adam who first ""sinned against himself,' and who therefore is called "" safíyu'llah,"" the pure of allah. (pilgrimage iii. 333.)    meaning, an angry, violent man.    arab. ""inshád,"" which may mean reciting the verse of another or improvising one's own. in modern egypt ""munshid"" is the singer or reciter of poetry at zikrs (lane m. e. chaps. xxiv.). here the verses are quite bad enough to be improvised by the hapless princess.    the negro skin assumes this dust colour in cold, fear, concupiscence and other mental emotions.    he compares her glance with the blade of a yamani sword, a lieu commun of eastern poetry. the weapons are famous in the nights; but the best sword-cutlery came from persia as the porcelain from china to sana'á. here, however, is especial allusion as to the sword ""samsam"" or ""samsamah."" it belonged to the himyarite tobba, amru bin ma'ad kurb, and came into the hands of harun al-rashid. when the emperor of the greeks sent a present of superior sword-blades to him by way of a brave, the caliph, in the presence of the envoys, took ""samsam"" in hand and cut the others in twain as if they were cabbages without the least prejudice to the edge of ""samsam.""    this touch of pathos is truly arab. so in the ""romance of dalhamah"" (lane, m. e. xxiii.) the infant gundubah sucks the breast of its dead mother and the king exclaims, ""if she had committed this crime she would not be affording the child her milk after she was dead.""    arab. ""sadda'l-aktár,"" a term picturesque enough to be preserved in english. ""sadd,"" i have said, is a wall or dyke, the term applied to the great dam of water- plants which obstructs the navigation of the upper nile, the lilies and other growths floating with the current from the (victoria) nyanza lake. i may note that we need no longer derive from india the lotus-llily so extensively used by the ancient egyptians and so neglected by the moderns that it has well nigh disappeared. all the central african basins abound in the nymphæa and thence it found its way down the nile valley.    arab. ""al marhúmah"": equivalent to our ""late lamented.""    vulgarly pronounced ""mahmal,"" and by egyptians and turks ""mehmel."" lane (m. e. xxiv.) has figured this queenly litter and i have sketched and described it in my pilgrimage (iii. 12).    for such fits of religious enthusiasm see my pilgrimage (iii. 254).    ""irák"" (mesopotamia) means ""a level country beside the banks of a ever.""    ""al kuds,"" or ""bays al-mukaddas,"" is still the popular name of jerusalem, from the heb. yerushalaim ha-kadushah (legend on shekel of simon maccabeus).    ""follow the religion of abraham"" says the koran (chaps. iii. 89). abraham, titled ""khalílu'llah,"" ranks next in dignity to mohammed, preceding isa, i need hardly say that his tomb is not in jerusalem nor is the tomb itself at hebron ever visited. here moslems (soi disant) are allowed by the jealousies of europe to close and conceal a place which belongs to the world, especially to jews and christians. the tombs, if they exist, lie in a vault or cave under the mosque.    abá, or abáyah, vulg. abayah, is a cloak of hair, goat's or camel's; too well known to require description.    arab. ""al-wakkád,"" the man who lights and keeps up the bath-fires.    arab. ""má al-khaláf"" (or ""khiláf"") a sickly perfume but much prized, made from the flowers of the salix ægyptiaca.    used by way of soap; like glasswort and other plants.    i.e., ""thou art only just recovered.""    to ""nakh"" is to gurgle ""ikh! ikh!"" till the camel kneels. hence the space called ""barr al-manákhah"" in al-medinah (pilgrimage i. 222, ii. 91). there is a regular camel vocabulary amongst the arabs, made up like our ""gee"" (go ye!), etc. of significant words worn down.    arab. ""laza,"" the second hell provided for jews.    the word has been explained (vol. i. 112).  it is trivial, not occurring in the koran which uses ""arabs of the desert ;"" ""arabs who dwell in tents,"" etc. (chaps. ix. and xxxiii.). ""a'arábi"" is the classical word and the origin of ""arab"" is disputed. according to pocock (notæ spec. hist. arab.): ""diverse are the opinions concerning the denomination of the arabs; but the most certain of all is that which draws it from arabah, which is part of the region of tehama (belonging to al-medinah pilgrimage ii. 118), which their father ismail afterwards inhabited."" tehamah (sierra caliente) is the maritime region of al hijaz, the moslems holy land; and its ""arabah,"" a very small tract which named a very large tract, must not be confounded, as some have done, with the wady arabah, the ancient outlet of the dead sea. the derivation of ""arab"" from ""ya'arab"" a fancied son of joktan is mythological. in heb. arabia may be called ""eretz ereb"" (or ""arab"")=land of the west; but in arabic ""gharb"" (not ereb) is the occident and the arab dates long before the hebrew.    ""when thine enemy extends his hand to thee, cut it off if thou can, or kiss it,"" wisely said caliph al-mansur.    the tartur was a peculiar turban worn by the northern arabs and shown in old prints. in modern egypt the term is applied to the tall sugar-loaf caps of felt affected mostly by regular dervishes. burckhardt (proverbs 194 and 398) makes it the high cap of felt or fur proper to the irregular cavalry called dely or delaty. in dar for (darfour) ""tartur"" is a conical cap adorned with beads and cowries worn by the manghwah or buffoon who corresponds with the egyptian ""khalbús"" or ""maskharah"" and the turkish ""sutari."" for an illustration see plate iv. fig. 10 of voyage au darfour par mohammed el tounsy (the tunisian), paris, duprat, 1845.    the term is picturesque and true; we say ""gnaw,"" which is not so good.    here, meaning an elder, a chief, etc.; the word has been almost naturalised in english. i have noted that abraham was the first ""shaykh.""    this mention of weighing suggests the dust of dean swift and the money of the gold coast it was done, i have said, because the gold coin, besides being ""sweated"" was soft and was soon worn down.    fem. of nájí (a deliverer, a saviour)=salvadora.    this, i have noted, is according to koranic command (chaps. iv. 88). ""when you are saluted with a salutation, salute the person with a better salutation."" the longer answer to ""peace be with (or upon) thee! "" is still universally the custom. the ""salem"" is so differently pronounced by every eastern nation that the observant traveller will easily make of it a shibboleth.    the badawi, who was fool as well as rogue, begins to fear that he has kidnapped a girl of family.    these examinations being very indecent are usually done in strictest privacy. the great point is to make sure of virginity.    this is according to strict moslem law: the purchaser may not look at the girl's nakedness till she is his, and he ought to manage matters through an old woman.    lit. wrath; affliction which chokes; in hindustani it means simply anger.    i.e. heaven forbid i be touched by a strange man.    used for fuel and other purposes, such as making ""doss stick.""    arab ""yaftah'allah"" the offer being insufficient. the rascal is greedy as a badaw and moreover he is a liar, which the badawi is not.    the third of the four great moslem schools of theology, taking its name from the imam al-sháfi'í (mohammed ibn idrís) who died in egypt a.h. 204, and lies buried near cairo. (sale's prel. disc. sect. viii.)    the moslem form of cabbala, or transcendental philosophy of the hebrews.    arab. ""bakh"" the word used by the apostle to ali his son-in-law. it is the latin ""euge.""    readers, who read for amusement, will do well to ""skip"" the fadaises of this highly educated young woman.    there are three persian kings of this name (artaxerxes) which means ""flour and milk,"" or ""high lion."" the text alludes to ardeshir babegan, so called because he married the daughter of babak the shepherd, founder of the sassanides in a.d. 202. see d,herberot, and the dabistan.    alluding to the proverb, ""folk follow their king's faith,"" ""cujus regio ejus religio"" etc.    second abbaside, a.h. 136-158 (=754-775).    the celebrated companion of mohammed who succeeded abu bakr in the caliphate (a.h. 13-23=634-644). the sunnis know him as al-adil the just, and the shiahs detest him for his usurpation, his austerity and harshness. it is said that he laughed once and wept once. the laugh was caused by recollecting how he ate his dough-gods (the idols of the hanifah tribe) in the ignorance. the tears were drawn by remembering how he buried alive his baby daughter who, while the grave was being dug, patted away the dust from his hair and beard. omar was doubtless a great man, but he is one of the most ungenial figures in moslem history which does not abound in genialities. to me he suggests a puritan, a covenanter of the sourest and narrowest type; and i cannot wonder that the persians abhor him, and abuse him on all occasions.    the austere caliph omar whose scourge was more feared than the sword was the - author of the celebrated saying ""consult them (feminines) and do clear contrary-wise.""    our ""honour amongst thieves.""    the sixth successor of mohammed and founder of the banu umayyah or ommiades, called the ""sons of the little mother"" from their eponymus (a.h. 41-60=661-680). for his badawi wife maysun, and her abuse of her husband, see pilgrimage iii. 262.    shaykh of the noble tribe, or rather nation, banu tamím and a notable of the day, surnamed, no one knows why, ""sire of the sea.""    this is essential for cleanliness in hot lands: however much the bath may be used, the body-pile and lower hair, if submitted to a microscope, will show more or less sordes adherent. the axilla-hair is plucked because if shaved the growing pile causes itching and the depilatories are held deleterious. at first vellication is painful but the skin becomes used to it. the pecten is shaved either without or after using depilatories, of which more presently. the body-pile is removed by ""takhfíf""; the libán shámi (syrian incense), a fir- gum imported from scio, is melted and allowed to cool in the form of a pledget. this is passed over the face and all the down adhering to it is pulled up by the roots (burckhardt no. 420). not a few anglo-indians have adopted these precautions    this caliph was a tall, fair, handsome man of awe-inspiring aspect. omar used to look at him and say, ""this is the cæsar of the arabs,"" while his wife called him a ""fatted ass.""    the saying is attributed to abraham when ""exercised"" by the unkindly temper of sarah; ""woman is made hard and crooked like a rib;"" and the modern addition is, ""whoso would straighten her, breaketh her.""    i.e. ""when ready and in erection.""    ""and do first (before going in to your wives) some act which may be profitable unto your souls"" or, for you: soul's good. (koran, chaps. ii. 223.) hence ahnaf makes this prayer.    it was popularly said that ""truth-speaking left omar without a friend."" entitled ""the just"" he was murdered by abu lúlúah, alias fírúz, a (magian ?) slave of al-maghírah for denying him justice.    governor of bassorah under the first four caliphs. see d'herbelot s.v. ""aschári.""    ziyad bin abi sufyan, illegitimate brother of the caliph mu'awiyah afterwards governor of bassorah, cufa and al-hijaz.    the seditions in kufah were mainly caused by the wilful nepotism of caliph othman bin asákir which at last brought about his death. his main quality seems to have been personal beauty: ""never was seen man or woman of fairer face than he and he was the most comely of men:"" he was especially famed for beautiful teeth which in old age he bound about with gold wire. he is described as of middling stature, large- limbed, broad shouldered, fleshy of thigh and long in the fore-arm which was hairy. his face inclined to yellow and was pock-marked; his beard was full and his curly hair, which he dyed yellow, fell below his ears. he is called ""writer of the koran"" from his edition of the m.s., and ""lord of the two lights"" because he married two of the prophet's daughters, rukayyah and umm kulthum; and, according to the shi'ahs who call him othman-i-lang or"" limping othman,"" he vilely maltreated them. they justify his death as the act of an ijmá' al-muslimín, the general consensus of moslems which ratifies ""lynch law."" altogether othman is a mean figure in history.    ""nár"" (fire) is a word to be used delicately from its connection with gehenna. you say, e.g. ""bring me a light, a coal (bassah)"" etc.; but if you say ""bring me fire! "" the enemy will probably remark ""he wanteth fire even before his time!"" the slang expression would be ""bring the sweet."" (pilgrimage i. 121.)    omar is described as a man of fair complexion, and very ruddy, but he waxed tawny with age, when he also became bald and grey. he had little hair on the cheeks but a long mustachio with reddish ends. in stature he overtopped the people and was stout as he was tall. a popular saying of mohammed's is, ""all (very) long men are fools save omar, and all (very) short men are knaves save ali."" the persians, who abhor omar, compare every lengthy, ungainly, longsome thing with him; they will say, ""this road never ends, like the entrails of omar."" we know little about ali's appearance except that he was very short and stout, broad and full-bellied with a tawny complexion and exceedingly hairy, his long beard, white as cotton, filling all the space between his shoulders. he was a ""pocket. hercules,"" and incredible tales, like that about the gates of khaybar, are told of his strength. lastly, he was the only caliph who bequeathed anything to literature: his ""cantiloquium"" is famous and he has left more than one mystical and prophetic work. see ockley for his ""sentences"" and d'herbelot s. d. ""ali"" and ""gebr."" ali is a noble figure in moslem history.    the emancipation from the consequences of his sins; or it may mean a holy death.    battle fought near al-medinah a.d. 625. the word is derived from ""shad"" (one). i have described the site in my pilgrimage, (vol. ii. 227).

""bikr"" is the usual form, but ""bakr,"" primarily meaning a young camel, is metaphorically applied to human youth (lane's lex. s. c.). the first caliph was a cloth-merchant, like many of the meccan chiefs. he is described as very fair with bulging brow, deep set eyes and thin-checked, of slender build and lean loined, stooping and with the backs of his hands fleshless. he used tinctures of henna and katam for his beard. the persians who hate him, call him ""pir-i-kaftár,"" the old she-hyaena, and believe that he wanders about the deserts of arabia in perpetual rut which the males must satisfy.    the second, fifth, sixth and seventh ommiades.    the mother of omar bin abd al-aziz was a granddaughter of omar bin al-khattab.    brother of this omar's successor, yezid ii.    so the turkish proverb ""the fish begins to stink at the head.""    calling to the slaves.    when the ""day of arafat"" (9th of zú'l-hijjah) falls upon a friday. for this hajj al- akbar see my pilgrimage iii. 226. it is often confounded by writers (even by the learned m. caussin de perceval) with the common pilgrimage as opposed to the umrah, or "" lesser pilgrimage"" (ibid. iii. 342, etc.). the latter means etymologically cohabiting with a woman in her father's house as opposed to 'ars or leading her to the husband's home: it is applied to visiting meccah and going through all the pilgrim-rites but not at the pilgrimage-season. hence its title ""hajj al-asghar"" the ""lesser hajj."" but ""umrah"" is also applied to a certain ceremony between the hills safá (a large hard rock) and marwah (stone full of flints), which accompanies the hajj and which i have described (ibid. iii. 344). at meccah i also heard of two places called al-umrah, the greater in the wady fátimah and the lesser half way nearer the city (ibid. iii. 344).    a fair specimen of the unworthy egoism which all religious systems virtually inculcate here a pious father leaves his children miserable to save his own dirty soul.    chief of the banú tamín, one of the noblest of tribes, derived from tamím, the uncle of kuraysh (koreish); hence the poets sang:—               there cannot be a son nobler than kuraysh,              nor an uncle nobler than tamím.  the high minded tamín is contrasted with the mean-spirited kays, who also gave rise to a tribe; and hence the saying concerning one absolutely inconsistent, ""art thou now tamín and then kays?""    surnamed al-sakafi, governor of al-yaman and irak.    tenth ommiade (regn. a h. 105-125 = 724-743).    or ""clothe thee in worn-out clothes"" i.e. ""become a fakir"" or religious mendicant.    this gratuitous incest in ignorance injures the tale and is as repugnant to moslem as to christian taste.    the child is named either on the day of its birth or on that day week. the father whispers it in the right ear, often adding the azán or prayer-call, and repeating in the left ear the ""ikámah"" or friday sentence. there are many rules for choosing names according to the week-day, the ascendant planet, the ""sortes coranicæ,"" etc.    amongst moslems as amongst christians there are seven deadly sins: idolatry, murder, falsely charging modest women with unchastity, robbing orphans, usury, desertion in holy war and disobedience to parents. the difference between the two creeds is noteworthy. and the sage knows only three, intemperance, ignorance and egoism.    meaning, ""it was decreed by destiny; so it came to pass,"" appropriate if not neat.    the short, stout, dark, long-haired and two-bunched camel from ""bukhtar"" (bactria), the ""eastern"" (bakhtar) region on the amu or jayhun (oxus) river; afterwards called khorasan. the two-humped camel is never seen in arabia except with northern caravans, and to speak of it would be a sore test of badawi credulity.    ""kaylúlah"" is the ""forty-winks"" about noon: it is a sunnat or practice of the prophet who said, ""make the mid-day siesta, for verily at this hour the devils sleep not."" ""aylúlain"" is slumbering after morning prayers (our ""beauty-sleep""), causing heaviness andid leness: ""ghaylúlah"" is dozing about 9 a.m. engendering poverty and wretchedness: ""kaylúlah"" (with the guttural kaf) is sleeping before evening prayers and ""faylúlah"" is slumbering after sunset—both held to be highly detrimental. (pilgrimage ii 49.)    the biblical ""hamath"" (hightown) too well known to require description. it is still famous for the water-wheels mentioned by al-hariri (assembly of the banu harám).    when they say, ""the levee flashes bright on the hills of al-yaman,"" the allusion is to the south quarter, where summer-lightning is seen. al-yaman (always with the article) means, i have said, the right-hand region to one facing the rising sun and al-sham (syria) the left-hand region.   again ""he"" for ""she,"" in delicacy and jealousy of making public the beauty or conditions of the ""veiled sex."" even public singers would hesitate to use a feminine pronoun. as will be seen however, the rule is not invariably kept and hardly ever in badawi poetry.    the normal pun on ""nuzhat al-zaman"" = delight of the age or time.    the reader will find in my pilgrimage (i. 305) a sketch of the takht-rawan or travelling-litter, in which pilgrimesses are wont to sleep.    in poetry it holds the place of our zephyr; end the ""bád- i-sabá""=breeze o' the morn, is much addressed by persian poets.    here appears the nervous, excitable, hysterical arab temperament which is almost phrensied by the neighbourhood of a home from which he had run away.    zau al-makan and nuzhat al-zaman.    the idea is essentially eastern, ""a lion at home and a lamb abroad"" is the popular saying.    arab.

""al-háfi,"" which in egyptian means sore-footed as well. he was an ascetic of the eighth and ninth centuries (a.d.). he relates a tradition of the famous soldier saint khálid bin walíd who lies buried like the poet ka'ab al-ahbár near hums (emessa) once the botia, phrygia, abdera, suabia of syria now halbun (pronounced halbáun) near damascus. i cannot explain how this kuraysh noble (a glorious figure in moslem history) is claimed by the afghans as one of their countrymen and made to speak pukhtu or pushtu, their rough old dialect of persian. the curious reader will consult my pilgrimage iii. 322 for the dialogue between mohammed and khalid. again there is general belief in arabia that the english sent a mission to the prophet, praying that khalid might be despatched to proselytise them: unfortunately mohammed was dead and the ""ingríz"" ratted. it is popularly held that no armed man can approach khalid's grave; but i suppose my revolver did not count.    when he must again wash before continuing prayer.    bin adham; another noted ascetic of the eighth century. those curious about these unimportant names will consult the great biographical dictionary of ibn khallikan, translated by baron macguckin de slane (1842-45).    thus making bishr the ""imám"" (artistes) lit. one who stands in front. in koran xvii. 74 it means ""leader"": in ii. 118 allah makes abraham an ""imam to mankind.""    a favourite sentiment in the east: we find it at the very beginning of sa'di's gulistan: better a weal-bringing lie than a harm-dealing truth.    a penny, one sixth of the drachma.    founder of the hanbali, fourth (in date) of the four orthodox moslem schools. the caliph al-mu'atasim bi'llah, son of harun al-rashid, who believed the koran to have been created and not a logos (whatever that may be), co-eternal with allah, scourged this imam severely for ""differing in opinion"" (a.h. 220=833). in fact few of the notable reverends of that day escaped without a caress of the scourge or the sword.    a learned man of the eighth century at bassorah (a.d.).    a traditionist of khorasan in the ninth century (a.d.).

(gen. xxix. 15-39.)    so says al-hariri (ass. of sasan), ""the neighbour before the house and the traveller before the journey."" in certain cities the neighbourhood is the real detective police, noting every action and abating scandals (such as orgies, etc.) with a strong hand and with the full consent of public opinion and of the authorities. this loving the neighbour shows evident signs of being borrowed from christianity.    al-asamm a theologian of balkh, ninth century (a.d.).    the founder of the senior school, for which see sale prel. disc. sect. viii.    thus serving the lord by sinning against his own body.    an egyptian doctor of the law (ninth century).    koran lxxvii. 35, 36. this is one of the earliest and most poetical chapters of the book.    abu hanifah was scourged for refusing to take office and was put to death in prison, it is said by poison (a.h. 150=a.d. 767), for a judicial sentence authorising rebellion against the second abbaside, al-mansur, surnamed abu'l-dawánik (father of pence) for his exceeding avarice.    ""lá rayba fí-hi"" says the koran (ii. 1) of itself; and the saying is popularly applied to all things of the faith.    arab. ""rivál al-ghayb,"" somewhat like the ""himalayan brothers"" of modern superstition. see herklots (qanoon-e-islam) for a long and careful description of these ""mardán-i-ghayb"" (pers.), a ""class of people mounted on clouds,"" invisible, but moving in a circular orbit round the world, and suggesting the hindu ""lokapálas."" they should not be in front of the traveller nor on his right, but either behind or on his left hand. hence tables, memorial couplets and hemistichs are required to ascertain the station, without which precaution journeys are apt to end badly.    a sweetmeat before noticed.    door hinges in the east are two projections for the top and bottom of the leaf playing in hollows of the lintel and threshold. it appears to be the primitive form, for we find it in the very heart of africa. in the basaltic cities of the hauran, where the doors are of thick stone, they move easily on these pins. i found them also in the official (not the temple)city of palmyra, but all broken.    the effect of the poison and of the incantation which accompanied it.    king omar who had raped her. my sympathies are all with the old woman who nightly punished the royal lecher.    arab. ""zunnár,"" the gr. . christians and jews were compelled by the fanatical sumptuary laws of the caliph al- mutawakkil (ad. 856) to wear a broad leather belt in public, hence it became a badge of the faith. probably it was confounded with the ""janeo"" (brahmanical thread) and the parsi sacred girdle called kashti. (dabistan i, 297, etc.). both mandeville and la brocquière speak of ""christians of the girdle, because they are all girt above,"" intending jacobites or nestorians.    ""siláh dár"" (arab. and pers.)=a military officer of high rank; literally an ""armour-bearer,"" chosen for velour and trustworthiness. so jonathan had a ""young man"" (brave) who bare his armour (i sam. xiv. 1, 6 and 7); and goliath had a man that bare the shield before him (ibid. xvii. 7, 41). men will not readily forget the name of sulayman agha, called the silahdar, in egypt. (lane m. e. chaps. iv.)    it will be told afterwards.    the elder brother thus showed himself a vassal and proved himself a good moslem by not having recourse to civil war.    arab. ""ghazwah,"" the corrupt gallicism, now europeanised=raid, foray.   turk in modern parlance means a turkoman, a pomade: the settled people call themselves osmanli or othmanli. turkoman=turk- like.    arab. ""nimsá;"" southern germans, austrians; from the slav. ""nemica"" (any germans), literally meaning ""the dumb"" (nemac), because they cannot speak slav.    arab. ""dubárá"" from the slav. ""dubrovnik,"" from ""dub"" (an oak) and ""dubrava"" (an oak forest). ragusa, once a rival of venice, gave rise to the word ""argosy."" d'herbelot calls it ""dobravenedik"" or ""good venice,"" the turkish name, because it paid tribute when venice would not (?).    arab. ""jawarnah,"" or, ""júrnah"" evidently zara, a place of many names, jadera (hirtius de bell. alex. cap. 13), jadra, zadra (whence the modern term), diadora, diadosca and jadrossa. this important liburnian city sent forth many cruisers in crusading days; hence the arabs came to know its name.    arab. ""banu'l-asfar;"" which may mean ""pale faces,"" in the sense of ""yeller girls"" (new orleans) and that intended by north american indians, or, possibly, the peoples with yellow (or rather tow-coloured) hair we now call russians. the races of hindostan term the english not ""white men,"" but ""red men;"" and the reason will at once be seen by comparing a britisher with a high-caste nágar brahman whose face is of parchment colour as if he had drunk exsangue cuminum. the yellow-faces of the text correspond with the sansk. ""svetadvipa""—whiteman's land.    arab. ""al-musakhkham."" no moslem believes that isa was crucified and a favourite fancy is that judas, changed to the likeness of jesus, thus paid for his treason. (evangel. barnabæ.) hence the resurrection is called not ""kiyámah"" but ""kumámah""=rubbish. this heresy about the cross they share with the docetes, ""certain beasts in the shape of men"" (says ignatius), who held that a phantom was crucified. so far the moslems are logical, for ""isa,"" being angelically, miraculously and immaculately conceived, could not be; but they contradict themselves when they hold a vacant place near mohammed's tomb for the body of isa after his second coming as a forerunner to mohammed and doomday. (pilgrimage ii. 89.)    a diviner, priest, esp. jewish, and not belonging to the tribe of levi.    again the coarsest word ""khara."" the allusion is to the vulgar saying, ""thou eatest skite!"" (i.e. thou talkest nonsense). decent english writers modify this to, ""thou eatest dirt:"" and lord beaconsfield made it ridiculous by turning it into ""eating sand.""   these silly scandals, which cause us only to smile, excite easterns to fury. i have seen a moslem wild with rage on hearing a christian parody the opening words of the koran, ""bismillahi 'l- rahmáni 'l-rahím, mismish wa kamar al-din,"" roughly translated,  ""in the name of allah, the compassionating, the compassionate! apricots and marmalede."" the idea of the holy merde might have been suggested by the hindus: see mandeville, of the archiprotopapaton (prelate) carrying ox-dung and urine to the king, who therewith anoints his brow and breast, &c. and, incredible to relate, this is still practiced after a fashion by the parsis, one of the most progressive and the sharpest witted of asiatic races.    meaning that he had marked his brow with a cross (of ashes?) as certain do on ash wednesday.    syria, the ""left-hand land"" as has before been explained. the popular saying about its people is ""shámi shúmi!""—the syrian is small potatoes (to render the sense americanicè). nor did syrus, the slave in roman days, bear the best of names. in al-hijaz the syrian is addressed ""abú shám"" (father of syria) and insulted as ""abuser of the salt"" (a traitor). yet many sayings of mohammed are recorded in honour of syria, and he sometimes used syriac words. such were ""bakh, bakh"" (=euge, before noticed), and ""kakh,"" a congener of the latin cacus and caca which our day has docked to ""cack."" (pilgrimage iii. 115)    koran xiv. 34. ""they (unbelievers) shall be thrown therein (i.e., the house of perdition=hell); and an unhappy dwelling shall it be.""    the leg-cut is a prime favourite with the eastern sworder, and a heavy two-handed blade easily severs a horse's leg.    mohammed repeatedly declared (koran lxi.) that the christians had falsified the passage (""i go to my father and the paraclete shall come,"" john xvi. 7) promising the advent of the comforter, (ibid. xiv. 20; xv. 26) by substituting the latter word for glorious, renowned, i.e., ahmed or mohammed=the praised one. this may have been found in the arabic translation of the gospels made by warakah, cousin to mohammed's first wife; and hence in koran lxi. we find jesus prophesying of an apostle ""whose name shall be ahmad."" the word has consequently been inserted into the arabic gospel of saint barnabas (dabistan iii. 67). moslems accept the pentateuch, the psalter and the gospel; but assert (koran, passim.) that all extant copies have been hopelessly corrupted, and they are right. moses, to whom the pentateuch is attributed, notices his own death and burial—""the mair the miracle,"" said the old scotch lady. the ""psalms of david"" range over a period of some five hundred years, and there are three isaiahs who pass with the vulgar for one. the many apocryphal gospels, all of which have been held genuine and canonical at different times and in different places, prove that the four, which are still in use, were retained because they lack the manifest absurdities of their discarded rivals.    arab. "" labbayka; "" the pilgrimage-cry (night xxii.) which in arabic is,  labbayk' allahumma, labbayk'! lá sharíka lake, labbayk'! inna 'l-hamda w'al ni'amata lake wa'l mulk! labbayk' allahumma, labbayk'!  some add ""here am i, and i honour thee, the son of thy two slaves; beneficence and good are all between thy hands.""with the ""talbiyah"" the pilgrims should bless the prophet, pray allah to grant heaven and exclaim, ""by thy mercy spare us from the pains of hell-fire!"" (pilgrimage iii. 232.) labbayka occurs in the verses attributed to caliph ali; so labba=he faced, and yalubbu=it faces (as one house faces another); lastly, he professed submission to allah; in which sense, together with the verbal noun ""talbiyah,"" it is used by al- hanri (pref. and ass. of su'adah).    arab. ""kissís"" (plur. kusús) from .    koran ii. the ""red cow"" is evidently the ""red heifer"" of barnabas, chaps. vii.    arab. ""al-jásalík""= .    this is from the first ""gospel of infancy,"" wherein jesus said to his mother, ""verily i am jesus, the son of god, the word which thou hast brought forth, as the angel gabriel did declare unto thee; and my father hath sent me to save the world"" (chaps. i. 2.). the passage is virtually quoted in the koran (chaps. iii. 141), of course omitting "" the son of god""    mohammed allowed his locks to grow down to his ear-lobes but never lower.    arab. ""lisám"" i have explained as a covering for the lower face, made by drawing over it the corner of the head-kerchief (pilgrimage i. 346). the lisám of the african tawárik hoods the eyes so that a man must turn up his face to see, and swathes all the lower half, leaving only the nose exposed. and this is worn by many men by night as well as by day, doubtless to avoid the evil eye. the native sultans of darfur, like those of bornu and others further west, used white muslin as a face-wrap: hence, too, the ceremonies when spitting, etc., etc. the kúfiyah or head-kerchief of the arabs soon reached europe and became in low latin cuphia; in spanish escofia; in ital. cuffia or scuffia; in french escoffion, scofion (reine marguerite) coëffe (une pellicule, marque de bonheur) coiffe and coife, &c.; the scotch curch or coif, opposed to the maiden snood, and, lastly our sergeant-at-law's coif. littré, the learned, who in erudition was né coiffé, has missed this obvious derivation.    ""cutting,"" throughout the book, alludes to the scymitar with which arabs never give point; and ""thrusting"" to the footman's spear and the horseman's lance.    a popular phrase, i repeat, for extreme tenor and consternation.    the name usually applies to a well-known district and city of al yaman, where ""koss the eloquent"" was bishop in mohammed's day: the negiran of d'herbelot. here, however, it is the syrian najrán (nejrân of missionary porter's miserable handbook), now a wretched village near the volcanic lajjá, about one hundred and twenty miles direct south of damascus and held by druzes and christians.    the kantár (quintal) of 100 ratls (ibs.) =98-99 ibs. avoir.    arab. ""juráb (bag) mi'adat- ih (of his belly),"" the ""curdling of the testicles"" in fear is often mentioned.    clearly alluding to the magic so deeply studied by mediæval jews.    arab. ""sahákah,"" lit. rubbing. the moslem harem is a great school for this ""lesbian (which i would call atossan) love ""; but the motive of the practice lies deeper. as amongst men the mixture of the feminine with the masculine temperament leads to sodomy, so the reverse makes women prefer their own sex. these tribades are mostly known by peculiarities of form and features, hairy cheeks and upper lips, gruff voices, hircine odour and the large projecting clitoris with erectile powers known to the arabs as ""bazar"" hence tabzír=circumcision or amputation of such clitoris. burckhardt (prov. 436) translates "" bazarah"" by slut or wench. he adds "" it originally signifies the labia which the cairenes also entice zambúr and which are cut off in girlhood."" see also lane, lex. s.v.; tabzír. both writers confuse excision of the nymphæ with circumcision of the clitoris (zambúr) al-siyúti (kitab al-izá' fi'ilm al-nikah) has a very interesting chapter on sapphic venery, which is well known to europe as proved by such works as ""gamiani,"" and ""anandria ou confessions de mademoiselle sappho, avec la clef,"" lesbos, 1718. onanism is fatally prevalent: in many harems and girls' schools tallow candles and similar succedanea are vainly forbidden and bananas when detected are cut into four so as to be useless; of late years, however, china has sent some marvellous artificial phalli of stuffed bladder, horn and even caoutchouc, the latter material of course borrowed from europe.    this is considered a powerful aphrodisiac in the east. hence male devotees are advised to avoid tile ""two reds,"" i.e. meat and wine; while the ""two reds,"" which corrupt women, are gold and saffron, that is perfumery. hence also the saying of mohammed:— ""perfumes for men should have scent and not colour; for women should have colour and not scent."" (mishkát al-masábíh ii. 361.)     these are the ""hibás"" or thin cords of wool which the badawi binds round his legs, i believe to keep off cramp. (pilgrimage iii. 78).    crying out ""la iláha illa 'llah."" (there is no god but the god.); technically called ""tahlíl.""    i.e. men, angels and devils, the ""triloka"" (triple people) of the hindus. alamín (plur.), never alamayn (dual), is the triregno denoted by the papal tiara, the three christian kingdoms being heaven, hell and purgatory.    matrahinna or mit-rahinah is a well-known village near memphis, the name being derived from the old egyptian minat-ro- hinnu, the port at the mouth of the canal. let me remark that two of these three words, ""minat"" and ""ru,"" are still common in "" aryan"" persian.    kirámat, a sign, a prodigy, opposed to mu'ujizah, a miracle wrought by a prophet. the sufis explain this thaumaturgy by allah changing something of nature's ordinary course in favour of an especial worshipper, and, after a fashion, this is catholic doctrine (see dabistan, iii. 173).    koran, x. 25, ""until the earth receive its vesture and be adorned with various plants.""    i.e. the young hair sprouting on the boy's cheek.    a fighter for the faith and now a title which follows the name, e.g. osmán páshá ghází, whom the english press dubbed ""ghazi osman.""    that is the king of constantinople.    cassia fistularis, a kind of carob: "" shambar"" is the arab. form of the persian "" chambar.""    koran, ii. 149. hence the vulgar idea that martyrs are still alive in the flesh. see my pilgrimage (ii. 110 and elsewhere) for the romantic and picturesque consequences of that belief. the commentators (jalál al-dín, etc.) play tricks with the koranic words, "" they (martyrs) are not dead but living"" (iii. 179) by placing the happy souls in the crops of green birds which eat of the fruits and drink of the waters of paradise; whereas the reprobates and the (very) wicked are deposited in black birds which drain the sanies and the boiling waters of hell. amongst the greeks a body remaining entire long after death suggests anathema maranatha: it is the contrary with catholic christians (boccaccio iv. 5, of the pot of basil). concerning this creed see maundrell, letter of 1698.    tor is ""mount sinai"" in the koran (xcv. 1). i have only to repeat my opinion concerning the present site so called: ""it is evident that jebel serbal dates only from the early days of coptic christianity; that jebel musa, its greek rival, rose after the visions of helena in the fourth century; whilst the building of the convent by justinian belongs to a.d 527. ras safsáfah, its rival to the north, is an affair of yesterday, and may be called the invention of robinson; and jebel katerina, to the south is the property of rüppell"" (midian revisited i., 237). i would therefore call the ""sinaitic"" peninsula, peninsula of paran in old days and peninsula of tor (from its chief port) in our time. it is still my conviction that the true mount sinai will be found in jabal aráif, or some such unimportant height to the north of the modern hajj- road from suez to akabah. even about the name (which the koran writes ""sainá"" and ""sínín"") there is a dispute: it is usually derived from the root ""sanah""=sentis, a bush; but this is not satisfactory. our eminent assyriologist, professor sayce, would connect it with ""sin,"" the assyrian moon- god as mount nebo with the sun-god and he expects to find there the ruins of a lunar temple as a solar fane stands on ba'al zapuna (baal zephon) or the classical mount casius.    alluding to the miracle of aaron's rod (the gift of jethro) as related in the koran (chapts. vii. 1., xx., etc.), where the egyptian sorcerers threw down thick ropes which by their magic twisted and coiled like serpents.    arab. ""ayát"" lit. ""signs,"" here ""miracles of the truth,"" 1. c. koranic versets as opposed to chapters. the ranks of the enemy represent the latter, sword-cuts the former—a very persuasive mode of preaching.    lane (m. e. chapt.. iii.) shows by a sketch the position of the worshipper during this ""salám"" which is addressed, some say, to the guardian angels, others suppose to all brother-believers and angels.    i.e., where the syrians found him.    i.e., dedianus arabised; a name knightly and plebian.    in such tales the wazir is usually the sharp-witted man, contrasting with the ""dummy,"" or master.    carrier-pigeons were extensively used at this time. the caliph al-násir li-díni lláh (regn. a.h. 575=1180) was, according to ibn khaldún, very fond of them. the moderns of damascus still affect them. my successor, mr. consul kirby green, wrote an excellent report on pigeon-fancying at damascus. the so-called maundeville or mandeville in a. d. 1322 speaks of carrier-pigeons in syria as a well-known mode of intercourse between lord and lord.    mohammed who declared ""there is no monkery in al-islam,"" and who virtually abolished the priest, had an especial aversion to the shaveling (ruhbán). but the ""gens æterna in quâ nemo nascitur"" (pliny v. 17) managed to appear even in al-lslam, as fakirs,, dervishes, súfis, etc. of this more hereafter.    i.e. her holiness would act like a fascinating talisman.    the ""smoking out"" practice is common amongst the arabs: hence marshal pelissier's so- called "" barbarity."" the public is apt to forget that on a campaign the general's first duty is to save his own men by any practice which the laws of fair warfare do not absolutely forbid.    i.e. mohammed, who promised heaven and threatened hell.    arab. ""ahr"" or ""ihr,"" fornication or adultery, i.e., irreligion, infidelity as amongst the hebrews (isaiah xxiii.17).    a sign of defeat.    in english ""last night"": i have already noted that the moslem day, like the jewish and the scandinavian, begins at sundown; and ""layl "" a night, is often used to denote the twenty- four hours between sunset and sunset, whilst ""yaum,"" a day, would by us be translated in many cases ""battle-day.""    iterum the ""himalayan brothers.""    again, mohammed who promised good to the good, and vice versâ.    they are sad doggrel like most of the pièces d'occasion inserted in the nights.    here ""kahwah"" (coffee) is used in its original sense of strong old wine. the derivation is ""akhá""=fastidire fecit, causing disinclination for food, the matambre (kill- hunger) of the iberians. in old days the scrupulous called coffee ""kihwah"" in order to distinguish it from 'kakwah,"" wine.    i.e. mohammed, a common title.    that is, fatal to the scoffer and the impious.    equivalent to our ""the devil was sick,"" etc.    i.e. to the enemy: the north american indians (so called) use similar forms of ""inverted speech""; and the australian aborigines are in no way behind them.    see vol. i., p. 154 (night xvi.).    arab. ""sauf,"" a particle denoting a near future whereas ""sa-"" points to one which may be very remote.    from the root ""shanh""=having a fascinating eye, terrifying. the irish call the fascinater ""eybitter"" and the victim (who is also rhymed to death) ""eybitten.""    i.e., not like the noble-born, strong in enduring the stress of fight.    i.e., of abraham. for the well zemzem and the place of abraham see my pilgrimage (iii. 171-175, etc.), where i described the water as of salt-bitter taste, like that of epsom (iii. 203). sir william muir (in his excellent life of mahomet, i. cclviii.) remarks that ""the flavour of stale water bottled up for months would not be a criterion of the same water freshly drawn;"" but soldered tins-full of water drawn a fortnight before are to be had in calcutta and elsewhere after pilgrimage time; and analysis would at once detect the salt.    racing was and is a favourite pastime with those hippomanists, the arabs; but it contrasts strongly with our civilised form being a trial of endurance rather than of speed. the prophet is said to have limited betting in these words, ""there shall be no wagering save on the kuff (camel's foot), the hafir (hoof of horse, ass, etc.) or the nasal (arrow-pile or lance head).""    in the mac. edit. ""arman""=armenia, which has before occurred. the author or scribe here understands by ""cæsarea"" not the old turris stratonis, herod's city called after augustus, but cæsareia the capital of cappadocia (pliny, vi. 3), the royal residence before called mazaca (strabo).    an idiom meaning ""a very fool.""    i.e. kána (was) má (that which) was (kána).    a son being ""the lamp of a dark house.""    when the israelites refused to receive the law (the souls of all the prophets even those unborn being present at the covenant), allah tore up the mountain (sinai which is not mentioned) by the roots and shook it over their heads to terrify them, saying, ""receive the law which we have given you with a resolution to keep it"" (koran chaps. xlx. 170). much of this story is from the talmud (abodah sar. 2, 2, tract sabbath, etc.) whence al-islam borrowed so much of its judaism, as it took christianity from the apocryphal new testament. this tradition is still held by the israelites, says mr. rodwell (p. 333) who refers it to a misunderstanding of exod. xix. 17, rightly rendered in the e. version ""at the nether part of the mountain.""    arab. ""azghán"" = the camel-litters in which women travel.    i.e. to joy foes and dismay friends.    whose eyes became white (i.e. went blind) with mourning for his son joseph (koran, chaps. xii. 84). he recovered his sight when his face was covered with the shirt which gabriel had given to the youth after his brethren had thrown him into the well.embed"

""before we start this next record…,"" schooly's saying. the record in question is called ""signifying rapper,"" a brief, bloody tale of ghetto retribution from side 2 of schoolly's smoke some kill. the black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in '74, and evidence is everywhere that nothing's changed since then. on the southbound left of the fitzgerald expressway pass 20 blocks of grim irish-catholic housing projects, the western border of belfast, complete with sinn fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious united ireland, a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the '74 court order that bused ""them"" from wherever it is ""they"" live-the third world fer crissakes--into 97-percent-white south boston. on the expressway's right is the place the fibula-busters are talking about: the simultaneous northern border of haiti, jamaica and georgia; a territory that maps of boston call north dorchester.  uniting the two sides of the expressway is just about nothing. both neighborhoods are tough and poor. both hate the college world across the river, which, because of boston's rotten public schools, they will never see as freshmen. and kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio, which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting the art of a ghetto philadelphian roughly their age, once much poorer than they, but now, on royalties from smoke some kill, very much richer.  not that the shared digging of black street music is news, or even new: twenty years ago, when morgan v. hennigan, boston's own brown v. board of education, was inching through the courts, and even dark-complected italians were sometimes unwelcome in the irish precincts east of the expressway, kids in boston's little belfast sang along with james brown over the radio. ""say it loud i'm black and i'm proud say it loud i'm black and i'm proud!""  except that halfway through the infectious funk, the crewcuts realize what they're saying: jesus christ, ""i'm proud to be black"" fer chrissakes, like when you're in the porno store, you know, and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the men's part, you know? not the part for men in the part that's about men, jesus, and you get the hell outta there. and so they hum/mumble the suppressed parts.  ""say it loud i'm mmm hum proud say it loud mum hum hum proud!""  but rap isn't funk, rock or jazz, and the vast crossover move, broadcasting ""ghetto"" music over college radios to ghettos of a different color, is no simple reenactment of past crossovers. how, for example, does the sing-along fan of smoke some kill mumble his way through these lines:  ""black is beautiful brown is sick? slick? stiff? yellow's ok but white ain't shit.""  rjam productions, modestly headquartered in a mixed black/hispanic field, corner section of north dorchester, is as follows:  * one (1) four-car garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block; * one (1) touch-tone telephone (leased); * two (2) chevy blazers, vanity-plated rjam1 and rjam2, each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks (also leased); * one (1) vcr with kathleen turner's body heat cued up on the morning in question; * most importantly, eight (8) promising acts under binding contract if, as has happened to many local labels, rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors, these would be the pieces. but there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneer's gavel. schoolly d, the original signifying rapper, looms irresistibly from the pages of rap ""fanzines"" hip-hop and the source; and rjam's prime, unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next schoolly d. or the next ice t, or kool moe dee, or l. l. cool j., or whoever's the special hero of the kid cutting the demo. on this particular morning, the dream is to be the next mc lyte--a hard-rapping woman known for jams like ""mc lyte vs. vanna whyte"" and ""10% dis""--since today is tam-tam's day and tam-tam is, at 16, a tough girl in the mc lyte mold who, like mc lyte, can dance, look good, and tell men to beat it, all at once.  or so claims tam-tam's producer, promoter, and dutch uncle, gary smith, who opened rjam on martin luther king's birthday, '89, with his older brother nate. nate, the elder statesman, is 25. gary, 22, runs the company while nate travels with his boyhood-friend-turned-boss, quadruple-platinum, prince-derived rapper/singer, bobby brown. rjam was founded in part with an investment from the 23-year-old multi-millionaire brown, a native of roxbury. brown now lives in los angeles.  nate and gary smith turn a healthy profit making demos at $500/tape, but the brothers aren't in the health business. their aim: to follow in the corporate footsteps of def jam, a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in hollis, queens, which since its basement days, has given america public enemy, l. l. cool j., the beastie boys, and much of the rest of that culture-quake called rap. gary smith doesn't compare rjam to def jam, and, unlike def jam's russell simmons, gary produces pop, soul, and r&b as well as straight rap, and actually prefers r&b. but how many sophomores at nearby jeremiah burke can afford to dream in r&b, to front music lessons and $500 for an nth-hand sound set-up, find three friends to learn drums, bass and keyboards, and then raise another $500 to make a demo at rjam? anybody with a larynx can rap, however, and rjam's brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman, boston edison and the chevrolet motor credit corp.  twenty minutes farther south on the fitzgerald expressway, across the neponset river and into the pricey suburbs, is the scene of john cheever's boyhood, more recently celebrated as massachusetts miracle country, where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week, four of which will fail within 12 months. rjam's gary smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban chambers of commerce, sharing their worries about cash flow, overhead, and the enforceability of his contracts; but gary's world and theirs are as far apart as those of ward and eldridge cleaver. worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives' seaside homes. in gary's neighborhood, property values are actually falling.  waiting less than patiently for tam-tam, gary honks twice. a tall, grave girl with an angel's heart-shaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of rjam1. she has, apparently, at least two voices, the cynical, sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling pebbles men ain't worth it, and the whisper in which she now says hello.  as rjam1 re-crosses north dorchester, heading back to the soundproof studios to get the day's work started, gary and dj reese hash out production details. tam-tam's a dignified island in the back seat, and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the motor city in '63 with berry gordy and an eighty-pound teenage diana ross, just voted best dressed at cass technical high school, driving crosstown to record a little number called ""where did our love go.""  ask tam-tam about diana ross, and she gives a beatific smile. she's 16; she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to, when rap was new and she was 8; run-dmc or somebody, she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences. like most of rap's black audience (as distinct from rap's white audience, which is usually a decade older), tam-tam has no first-hand recollection of james brown except as a source for rap. she is too young to have attended segregated schools. she was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in boston and can't remember the awful day in '74 when ""pro-neighborhood"" marchers from irish south boston came upon a black pedestrian at city hall and beat him with pole-mounted american flags.  tam-tam has star presence, and like many who do, she seems to see very little of what goes on around her, the price of the star's intense focus on self. she reminds you of senator gary hart. he, too, had star presence. in front of a crowd, hart was riveting; in the elevator riding up to the auditorium, he was barely there. being barely there in the neighborhood tam-tam calls home is probably not such a bad thing, and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here. ambition is, finally, a form of hope, a scarce commodity in north dorchester.  back in rjam's control booth, dj reese and producer ralph stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be ""ho, you're guilty."" drum parts are taken from a roland tr-909 rhythm composer, a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the user's choice of drum-matrix. the tr-909's keys, on a console designed to resemble, vaguely, the familiar piano, are named after the sound each creates-bass, snare, mid-tom, hi-tom--and the sounds are named after the actual drums which, until the tr-909, were required to make those sounds. the tr-909 even sports a key named hand clap, making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger, rendering obsolete the zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping. the finished ""ho, you're guilty"" will sound lush with percussion, melody, and instrumental breaks. not one human musician will be employed in the recording process.  each percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track: a snare track, a bass track, a clap track, etc. reese has been studying the classics lately, too, viz: james brown's dead on the heavy funk from '75ish, including the ageless groove, ""funky president,"" in which james announces his third-party candidacy. some of bobby byrd's dead guitar, and a holy moment when james exhales rhythmically, have been isolated from a store-bought cassette of dead, re-recorded on clean tape, then re-re-recorded onto a computer-readable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by ralph stacey using a roland d-50 linear synth. the guitar and the exhalation then go, as altered, from the synth to yet another of the 24 tracks on the big mixing board. reese, the dj, will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these 24 strands.  as reese and ralph stacey mix the 24 tracks onto one master tape, tam-tam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth. you ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf. she doesn't seem to register the question. ""the other career besides rap i'd like to pursue is modelling,"" she says. ""i'm five-seven. that's the perfect height for a model.""  mixing takes the rest of the day. producer ralph stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question: ""why do you want to write about rap, anyway?"" it is lucky that at that minute reese is done mixing. tomorrow the rjam staff will tape tam-tam's vocal track and lay this over reese's rhythm track. then the sound will be ""fattened"" with stacks of horns, guitar hooks, bells, canned applause, and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the rolands. the final demo tape of ""ho, you're guilty"" will then be shopped to the 20 major, minor, and tiny labels who might release the demo as a 12-inch single.  everyone's ready to call it a day. gary smith's already huddled with some new wanna-be stars in rjam's reception area. reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth, and tam-tam immediately stands, modelling forgotten, utterly alert. reese gestures to her with maestro hands. she raps at an absent antoinette in the hard, sexy voice you haven't heard since this morning, extemporaneous but on beat: ""i'm a female you're just a fairytale.""  the small-w we here are two white boston males: one native, one oft-transplanted; both residing in somerbridge, a dim, ethnic-portuguese neighborhood whose gentrification we abet. m. is an attorney with a taste for jazz, blues, funk; d. a grad student and would-be drifter who watches tv instead of sleeping. our cultural tastes and interests are day and night. they converged only lately, when d's stereo arrived ups and we discovered we shared an uncomfortable, somewhat furtive, and distinctively white enthusiasm for a certain music called rap/hip-hop.* about our passions and discomforts we could determine only that they were vague & distinct contexts and cathexes brought to bear across the same ethnic distance on the same thing. for instance, we agreed that real or serious rap is not jj fad or tone loc or beasties, egyptian lover or fat boys, not experiments or freakshows or current commercial crossover slush. ""serious"" rap--a unique u.s. inner-city fusion of funk, technified reggae, teen-to-teen ""hardcore"" rock, and the early 70s ""poetry of the black experience"" of nikki giavonni, the last poets, etc.--has, since its late-70s delivery at the record-scratching hands of afrika bambaataa and his zulu nation, sugarhill gang, kool herc and his automated herculords, and grandmaster flash, always had its real roots in the neighborhood, the black gang-banger underground. black music, of and for blacks.  we concurred as to the wheres and whens of rap's begetting--mid-to-late 70s' south bronx house parties; then, by decade's end, block parties, with municipal electric lights tapped for a power source, literal dancing in the streets; by '82, regular rap-houses and then ""floating clubs""--the roxy every sunday, the bronx's disco fever twth--everybody breaking to a new musical antimusic being fashioned from records and turntables and an amateur djs ad-lib banter; a very heavy reggae influence at the beginning; the more rhythmic pure rap an offshoot, its brisker, sparer, backbeat designed for breakdance, and the smooth-rapping partygoer who just didn't want to shut up when others' music was on. we agreed, too, on rough chronology: amateur house-partiers giving way to professional djs, pioneers; they, too, then overshadowed by new art-entrepreneurs, former breakers, failed singers, gag-majorettes; then the rise of ""indies,"" the tiny independent labels that keep most new music on life-support--sugar hill, jive, tommy boy, wild pitch, profile records, enjoy--then, after king tim iii's ""personality jock"" and sugarhill gang's ""rapper's delight,"" an entree into urban black radio; then to underground ""mix"" radio; then corporate levels, digital technology, very big money, the early-80s talent that became an early scene's cream--spoonie g. and sequence, eric fresh, unknown dj, egyptian lover and run-dmc. then, spring '84, the extraordinary midas touch of rick rubin and russell simmons' def jam label (now under contract to cbs) from which sprang a mid-80s stable of true stars, in the underground--public enemy, l. l. cool j, slick rick, the still-unparalleled eric b. and rakim--and l.a.'s alternatives: kool moe dee, l.a. dream team, and others. and now, at decade's end, an absolute explosion of rap-as-pop, big business, mtv, special fashions, posters, merchandise, with only a few big, new, cutting-edge acts--l.a.'s n.w.a., philadelphia's schoolly d, miami's 2 live crew, de la soul's house-blend of rap/funk/jazz--remaining too esoteric or threatening or downright obscene to cross all the way over and cash in with big labels. by '89 rap is finally proving as ""important"" (read also lucrative) to an anemic shock-and rebellion-music industry as punk was an exact decade ago. this was all just data. we agreed on it, and on how it was curious that we both had such strange, distant facts down cold.  our point of departure, essay-wise, was always less what we know than what we felt, listening: less what we liked than why. for this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap, trying to summon a kind of objective, critical, purely ""aesthetic"" passion that the music itself made impossible. for outsiders, rap's easy to move to, hard to dissect. the more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued, the more we felt that the stuff's appeal for two highbrow, upscale whites was just plain incongruous. because serious rap has, right from the start, presented itself as a closed show. usually critical questions of culture, context, background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions. not here. no question that serious rap is, and is very self-consciously, music by urban blacks about same to and for same. to mainstream whites it's a tight cohesion that can't but look, from outside the cultural window, like occlusion, clannishness (sic) and inbreeding, a kind of reverse snobbery about what's ""def"" and ""fresh"" and in-the-scene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college societies and wasp-only country clubs. serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or establishment, and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individuals--the great white male is rap's grand inquisitor, its idiot questioner--its alien other no less than reds were for mccarthy. the music's paranoia, together with its hermetic racial context, helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and scary.  other incongruities. rap is a ""music"" essentially without melody, built instead around a digitally synthesized drum- and back-beat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waiting-room table, enhanced by ""sampled"" (pirated) ""krush grooves"" (licks or repetitive chord-series) conceived and recorded by pre-rap rock icons, the whole affair characterized by a distinctive, spare, noisy, clattering ""style"" whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of low-i amperage around the performative circuit of the mc/rapper and his record-scratching, sound-mixing sancho panza, the dj.  the rapper (the guy in the cameo cut or kangol hat, pricey warm-up, unlaced adidas, extra thick gold chain or oversized medallion) offers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight, stressed, rhymed verse, the verse's syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboing-for-rhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from nantucket. the lyrics, nearly always self-referential, tend to be variations on about half a dozen basic themes, themes that at first listen can seem less alien or shocking than downright dull. eg: just how bad/cool/fresh/def the rapper and his lyrics are; just how equally un-all-these his music rivals are; how troublesome, vacuous and acquisitive women are; how wonderful it is to be ""paid in full"" for rapping instead of stealing or dealing; how gangs are really families, 'caine's constant bad news. and, in particular, how sex and violence and yuppie toys represent perfectly the urban black lifedrive to late-80s american glory.  the masks are many, too many for anything really but direct aural inspection: rap personae can change frequently even within single albums, the rapper delivering hard, violent black nationalist communique on one cut, dubbing against trinidadian steel drums on another, basking in big label eclat on a third, cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb, cooing to his ""bitch"" and then on the flip side, threatening to go get his gun again if she can't learn who's boss. though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face, the quintessential rap group is unquintessential, chameleonesque. this is either by weird design, or it's a symptom and symbol of 80s facelessness…or most likely, it's just a good old venerable synecdoche of rap's genre itself, one that's now moving so fast it can't quite fix on its own identity -- much less hold still for anything like cool, critical classification or assessment, from outside.  the mc's alice toklas-esque dj hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black germanness of a whole lot of digital editing & playback equipment. his responsibility is the song behind and around the rap -- the backbeat, krush groove, and the ""sound carpet,"" i.e. a kind of electric aural environment, a chaos behind the rapper's rhymed order, a digitalized blend of snippets, squeaks, screams, sirens, snatches from pop media, all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of ""samples"" that results. the most recognizable of these samples range from staccato record-scratches to james brown and funkadelic licks, to m.l.k.'s public dream, to quotidian pop pap like ""the theme from shaft,"" brady bunch dialogue, and '50s detergent commercials.  we have now read every review and essay to do with serious underground hip-hop available in every single on-line periodical ... xcept for one or two underground newsletters (viz. the city sun, fresh-est) circulated in parts of the bronx demimonde where learning about rap is as hard for white outsiders as scoring fine china white or aks. from the kind of sedulous bibliomaniacal research to be expected of conscientious lawyers and phds, the following has become clear. outside england, where the punk-weaned audience has developed a taste for spectacle-through-windows, for vicarious rage and protest against circumstances that have exactly 0% to do with them, most of what rolling stone calls ""devoted rock consumers"" (meaning we post-baby-boomers), plus almost all established rock critics, tend to regard non-crossover rap as essentially boring and simplistic, or swaggering and bellicose and dangerous--at all events, basically vapid and empty because of its obsessive self-referentiality…in short, as closed to them, to us, as a music. unrecognizable as what we've been trained and adverted to buy as pop.... great to dance to, of course, but then what might the white audience for today's mainstream expect? rap, whether fecund or sterile, is today's pop music's lone cutting edge, the new, the unfamiliar, the brain-resisted-while-body-boogies. and that resisted, alien, exhilarating cutting edge has always been black.  ""what have you left me? what have i got? last night in cold blood my young brother got shot my homey got jacked my mother's on crack my sister can't work cause her arms show tracks madness, insanity live in profanity then some punk claim that they understandin' me? give me a break--what world do you live in? death is my sex--guess my religion.""**  what makes this stuff so much more disturbing, more real to outsiders than the punk rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously? maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom: i always found it tough to listen straight-faced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit. all doctrine and pronouncement, exclusively anti-, this punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void, nothing human to grab onto. i have no idea what a punk performer thinks, feels, is, day-to-day... in fact i always suspected he had no day, but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow. can you imagine a punk with four-foot hair and spiked jacket and nose-ring, say, eating a bologna sandwich? replacing a light bulb? putting a quarter in a meter? not me, boy. and even barnum, who knew fear sells, also knew that freakshows aren't frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance. 0% affinity = 0% empathy. and fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or threat.  public enemy and n.w.a., ice t and schoolly d discomfit us, our friends, the critics we read and cornered, because the hard rappers' lyrics are conscientious about being of/for the real lives and attitudes of recognizable, if alien, persons. here's where it's a level up from mere spectacle: ideology in hard rap is always informed by incident or named condition. this makes rap not only better than punk, but way scarier. serious hard raps afford white listeners genuine, horse's-mouth access to the life-and-death plight and mood of an american community on the genuine edge of im-/explosion, an ugly new sub-nation we've been heretofore conditioned to avoid, remand to the margins, not even see except through certain carefully abstract, attenuating filters.  for outsiders, rap is hard to dissect, easy to move to. the command is: dance, don't understand; participate, don't manipulate. rap is a fortress protected by the twin moats of talk and technology. the first is that nu style of speak--the ""dialect drug,"" de la soul calls it--that rappers fashion from jive and disseminate through record stores to all of us. some in-words, like ""fly,"" meaning ""finelooking,"" have been in coin since the beginning, now venerable as old english because they turn up on grandmaster flash cuts from '82. others, like ""dead presidents,"" rap for $$, are either coming into or going out of currency, depending on when you read this. rap, a club language, has myriad ways to describe one's own or others' looks. ""fly"" is how a man digs a woman. one would never describe oneself as ""fly,"" even when cataloguing one's own attractions (done more in rap than anyplace except perhaps village voice personals). ""fresh"" means irresistibly stylish, oft-modified by ""funky,"" ""crazy,"" or ""stoopid,"" predominantly used to convey the fly-ness of things other than women, including oneself or one's rap, which two concepts rappers, like schizophrenics, can't always keep separate in their heads. ""dope"" means ""def,"" and ""def"" means crazy funky stoopid fresh. synonyms include: the shit, the it, the cool, the thang, the word, the grooviest, the categorical imperative, die weltanschung, the that-which-potter-stewart-would-know-if-he-saw. a def rapper is so style-defining as to make the stylish mere copycats. to be def is to rap to the beat of a different drum machine--not seeking solitude, but rather confident that others will follow. the def rapper mc's a def rap, which rap def-ly tells of its own (and the rapper's) def-ness--so def, as mc/manager, entrepreneur russell rush simmons brags, that it had to be on a label called def jam.  rap celebrates power, equating strength with style, and style with the ""i"" in ""individuality."" rappers ""dis""--dismiss--the styleless, faceless. to ""ill"" is to be weak or wrong; to ""bite"" is to thieve another's dope beat. and only the ill would bite.  early remastered pop was the first fake music ever, since what the record buyer of '63 experienced as aural event on his turntable couldn't happen live. rock began to become an illusion of event which technology made possible; rock became more like the movies, starting down a long road at the end of which was mtv.  not that this kept phil spector up nights. the gurus of the studio had fatter fish to clean, for the new freedom to shape sound had come at a price. with each magnetic jump from live, as tape was made of tapes which were themselves tapes of tapes, the hiss and crackle of interference multiplied. dual high-bias media with 2 units each of sonic garbage per 10,000 units of elvis presley, retaped on similar 2-units-per-10,000 tape, became 4 units of hiss; retaped, 8; then 16; then 32. as the sound got fuller, it decayed.  the solution was a breakthrough called multi-tracking--using recorders that could capture and play back on 2 (as in stereo), 4 (as in '67's then-ear-shattering sergeant pepper's lonely heart's club band), 12, 16, and today 24 parallel tracks, eliminating the hiss of transference from one machine to the next. rhythms, melodies, harmonies could all be captured on separate tracks, allowing the performer or producer to mix and listen and re-mix, adding vocals or lead instrument on yet another track. rap edisons like kool herc, grandmaster flash and afrika bambaataa began as party djs, not musicians. their wiring of twin turntables to a mixer, allowing them to ""stack"" the sound of two different records while rapping into a mike, was a kind of crude, extemporaneous multitracking. technological loops like those in the nasa-esque studios of cbs and polygram were now in the hands of the homeboys. carter was president. the bee gees, with five top-ten hits in twelve months, were king.  digital recording, the science dividing rjam's tam-tam on tape from tam-tam as heard ""live"" is a technology that converts music to codes or ""digits."" the codes are ""read"" by a computer, one combining sophisticated sound-to-code translation hardware with a number-crunching cos and a high-response synthesizer, at speeds of 40,000 digits per second and up. the recorded sounds, reduced to numbers, can be shaped, mangled, muffled, amplified, and even canonized.*** hardware then translates the digits, as read and altered, back into sound, which can itself be recorded on multitrack and combined with yet more sounds. the result: hiss-free reproduction on an infinity of tracks, each of which can itself be manipulated infinitely.  digital recording, part of the 80s sea-change in how pop gets made, divides the responsibility for the final song more or less equally between the performer, the engineer at the mixing board, the producer who coordinates the multi-tracking and mixing process, and the electronic hardware that actually ""makes"" the music we buy. the latest synthesizers**** produce notes from pure electric current instead of electronically amplified vibrations, with voltage-meters rather than hands or feet determining everything from key to pitch to timbre to ""attack-delay envelope"" (another non-rap term, denoting the microtimed, counterpoised quality of a note's duration, how a note's sound/quaver-structure as it builds is different from its sound and structure as it fades--the manipulation of a piano's foot-pedals, for example, affects the delay component of each note and chord's envelope). the kurzweil 250, a state-of-the-art system, is a 1-?track/12,018-note synthesizer linked by software to an apple macintosh plus, which serves as an exhaustive library of digitized sound. the kurzweil could put all of culture in a blender--take janet leigh's cremora-curdling scream from psycho, store it in the mac, program the synth such that an f# will be reproduced as janet leigh's f# scream, then play ""we shall overcome"" as if screamed by janet leigh; store this; treat similarly bach's st. matthew's passion, except with vast choruses of screaming janet leighs, then ""mary had a little lamb,"" then ""twist and shout"" (by the isleys, not the beatles), all as screams; then replay the four as one horrific jumble, or select amidst the jumble; and then whatever you came up with in the final, painstakingly re-mixed mix you could play backwards. and call that ""finished."" or never finish. it's like holding music at gunpoint. you can make it do--or do to you --whatever you can think of. whim is the only limit.  basically we decided we were into rap because, even media-hype aside, this music had some kind of hard edge to it. date of composition here is july '89. think back. this last has been a fiscal year in which madonna's ""back on top,"" in which covers of classic covers of classic tunes are themselves covered and then climb corporate charts, in which rod stewart's out of cryogenics and back on top.... mtv's ceased to be anything but a long commercial for itself and the interests of corporate labels; bobby mcferrin makes a platinum mint and then several commercial jingles out of a burbled synth-reggae invitation to ""be happy,"" a song that has the same verbal-pre-packaging feel as ""where's the beef?""  this last year heavy metal's fake-satanist male models accounted for 1/2 of total u.s. record sales; u2 filmed a $20,000,000 homage to their own self-righteousness and bono's ever more ill-disguised megalomania. a year when even good old rem finally went corporate-pop with green, when good old springsteen trashed his bride, when as modest and nascent a talent as tracy chapman earned cymbal-crashing critical raves for her competent, updated frappe of baez and armatrading, so desperate were pop critics and consumers for any voice at once comprehensible and even remotely fresh. just not a notable pop year at all. except in rap. rap appears in the famished late 80s as potentially a genuine musical scene the way early jazz, rock, the summer of love, folk/protest, god even the way new wave and punk were ""scenes""--the s-word here simultaneously meaning: something new to look at; something loud and upsetting (""oh please, veronica, let's not have a scene!""); and, best, an identifiable set of places in time where large forces meet, marry and beget. whether by virtue or default, rap is pretty much what there is to like right now, if you want to regard today's pop as anything more than covert jingles in 4/4-time. in our opinion.  but so the point is we enjoy it. plus we've developed some theses about why serious rap is important, both as art-for-own-sake and as a kind of metaphor-with-larynx for a subbed-culture unique in its distillation of the energy and horror of the american present.  rap is expanding gas-like through the 80s' dry time, growing from house party schtick, gang anthem, a small-label fad with the sort of pop lifespan you measure with eggtimers--then somehow, when we weren't looking, into scene, movement, on the air--finally, in the last 24 months, assuming the fecund role of genuine genre. exploding into subspecies now faster than you can track. there's now dub's mix of rap and reggae, house's mix of rap and 70s-, huge-afro'd funk, acid house's psychedelic hip-hop. there is black rap for white mass-consumption (tone loc, run?dmc), black rap for local set and -house consumption (countless local stars and wanna-be's in every large city), ultra-black rap superstars for the whole marginal nation inside (heavy d, public enemy, big daddy kane), white rap for white masses (the execrable beastie boys). there is hispanic, salsa-influenced rap out of different west coast barrios, rap fused with west indian or islamic traditional music in digital underground, eric b. and rakim, and others, or fused with oh-so-danceable r&b in the new ""jack swing"" offshoot (bobby brown, mc hammer); even gay and bohemian young urban bs have their trendsetters in teddy riley and guy, de la soul, kwabe. etc. etc.***** a major impediment to sampling this scene is the kaleidoscopic fury with which the scene itself is changing. if you're reading this in print it's already dated.  and the rap world's vitality is one of replacement as well as variety, allowing the genre to remain fresh, as band after band is seduced into the ""real"" music biz. this scene is hydra-like. almost the moment a rap artist like run-dmc or l. l. cool j ""breaks through"" into major-market mix appeal, mtv's land of corporate bankability, certain reactions within the urban underground that spawned them can almost always be observed. the breakthrough band's b-boys themselves are without qualms about the pop bigtime: after all, they've been rapping all along about their entitlement to money and status, about the inevitable rewards of their freshness and unbiteable voice. their postbreakthrough raps tend all often to become celebrations of their new wealth and fame, of the now-enhanced authority of their ""message""--though it's hard to feature public enemy rapping about a black-militant renaissance, about revolution and american apocalypse, while lily-white cbs records pays them millions for the distribution rights to just such exhortations to cut corporate throats.  nevertheless, back in the underground scene, the breakthrough band's tight set of original fans tends to hang loyal, to await feverishly ""their"" crew's spots on the same music tv they love to dis. in short, there are comparatively few of the accusations of selling out that accompanied a similarly oxymoronic coopting phenomenon in late-60s protest rock. which if you think about it, is passing strange. the white mainstream other against which serious rap aligns and defines itself makes the 60s ""establishment"" too look downright benign.  our opinion, then, from a distance: not only is a serious rap serious poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the great 80s market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we've been encouraged sadly to write off,6 it's quite possibly the most important stuff happening in american poetry today. ""real"" (viz. academic) u.s. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocab, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred and (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn't get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers, doesn't get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership (most of the moved being poets themselves), doesn't generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best phd-poets rent their names and time ... and especially does not inspire a whole culture's youth to try to follow in their connecticut-catalogue brogans' prints. because of rap's meteoric rise, though, you've got poor kids, tough kids, ""underachievers,"" a ""lost generation""... more young people--ostensibly forever turned off ""language"" by tv, video games and low u.s.d.e. budgets--more of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time, trying to put words together in striking and creative ways, than the u.s.a. has probably ever had at one time. that few of these will become ""stars"" matters far less than the grim stats about, say, the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status: the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values (and values enough to let rap-dissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing) can obviously be applied in mainstream-approved, ""productive"" ways--g.e.d.'s college, standard written english ...perhaps someday even ad-copywriting!  but is this wildfire of urban rap ambition raging around converted four-car garages like north dorchester's rjam's in spite of the genre's near-disciplinary prosodic restrictions, or because of them? can't really tell. probably doesn't matter. the fact remains that, were ""important poetry"" presently defined in terms of what makes important art important in a supply-side democracy (popularity, effect, the separation of fan from his cash), staid journals like poetry and american poetry review would be featuring some number of fade-cut, multiple-earring'd authors' photos in each issue; and highbrow public readings would always carry their back row fraction of bangers ready to ""listen rude"" to wilbur and levertov and ashbery, just as e.g rimbaud and pound did to their own contemporaries ... to the delight and invigoration of a time's poetry...  ... and even just the prospected fantasy of seeing public enemy's be-clocked flavor fav and like a jorie graham or amy clampitt sitting down over beer and celestial seasonings to hash out the debate over line-breaks in dactylic pentameter, a very serious young homeboy in italian silk and pentagonal shades serving as interpreter is enough to make us hereby officially lobby for the admission of rhyme's renaissance--at least under the stringent rhythmic demands rap has forced on rhyme-as-form--to the cold corridors of serious appreciation.  unlike the mostly docile poetry and fiction of the late 80s, though, rap's own quality, the def freshness of the mc's bit, is set up to be judged primarily in the context of what it is against. in case you thought we forgot, rap is first of all a movement in rock music, and thus the time-honored requirement is that the rap scene set itself very consciously athwart those circumstances and forces whose enormity is required by all rock 'n roll to justify one of its essential roles, rebellion-against. except now watch the objects of the rebellion alter, spread, grow in urgency--from the 50s' parents and principals, homework, hot rods, the sweet hurt of teen love, to the urban 80s, police, violent death, homelessness, the lure of ecstatic drugs that dehumanize weaponry, fatherlessness, the animal emptiness of sex w/o love, the almost trilaterally sinister white establishment (""the government's responsible the government's. . . ""), everyone else: life as a series of interruptions from an angry slumber about what the electric voices say you must have and the human voices say you may not, about the betrayal of the past, of the promises exacted by carmichael, x, and the now-formal martyrdom of king.  segregation may affect their hearts and minds, earl warren warned, as malcolm x and louis farrakhan, both alumni of boston's old separate-but-awful schools, bear loud witness. now, 40 years after x disgustedly quit a racist high school and began a career as a kind of be-bop gang-banger, 35 years after brown v. board of education invented integration, 15 years after morgan v. hennigan brought brown to boston, north dorchester is worse and its schools aren't better. a former united states secretary of education converts to drug czar, symbolizing a national change of mind: now drugs, not poor schools (and certainly not the american apartheid of which segregated schools were but one facet), is our root ""innercity"" problem. tam-tam's boston is strangely less hopeful than the notoriously segregated pre-hennigan city, perhaps because before hennigan reformers could promise that segregation was why things were so bad. segregation was blame's bullseye: abolish the bullseye, and blame for the estrangement of the races flies everywhere, hitting the cops, or the courts, or the teachers, or the taught, or what's taught. there's even a rap--b.d.p.'s ""why is that?""--blaming our miseries on the failure of the schools to ""teach black kids to be black.""  but everything the white rock listener pays to enjoy is black-begotten. if today's top?40 environment seems bleak or befouled, imagine the present mainstream without its sweetest sourcewaters, without the king-waters-king blues trinity, the brownian soul, the backbeat, cut time, blue notes, funky french curves of sax and brass, the guitar solo, call-and-response, the cold medina or lucky powder, those lithely syncopated quintets in pomade and linen suits, the single hand in the white glove holding pepsi aloft in the shadow of accidental flames.... black music is american pop's breath and bread; and we, as both born audience and born salesmen, know it.  so maybe it's them. them. maybe we're approaching an enforced fork in the musical road where the white-run entertainment industry will have to pack up what it's taken and go seek its fortune on the backs of new minorities. maybe, in serious rap, the extreme new insulation of the black sound is not only intentional but preplanned, part of a neo-nationalist agenda, the hermetic new scene's tight circle more like something large and coiled than something small and flat.  you may now be getting some hazy idea of the sorts of really quite scary possibilities with which the rap we like is replete. and, hazier, of how complicated this stuff of sampler-from-outside can be. what's remained passing strange, for use, is the vague threat's appeal. the unease and ambivalence with which the rare white at the window loves rap renders that love no less love. whence the fear, though, is really no matter. for look at the world, at the masses we're part of. at what you look at closest. the plain 80s data is that, whereas love, devotion, passion seem only to divide, it's fear and strangeness that bind crowds, fill halls, unite us, somehow, as audience, under the great tent.  *'hip-hop' is an older synonym, coined by rap pioneer, kool herc, to describe the heavily danceable jamaican scatting he introduced between records at the huge south bronx block parties he and other new-scene celebrities, like jazzy five and former black spades leader, afrika bambaataa, could turn into late-70s frenzies of breakdance (both music and dance a self-conscious reaction against the glittered unreality of downtown disco).  **except but now hey kids! thanks to at&t you can now speak directly to ice t and hear his philosophy of life by phone! 1-900-907-9111.

"some dreamers of the golden dream lyricsthis  is a story about love and death in the golden land, and begins with the country.  the san bernardino valley lies only an houreast of los angeles by way of the san bernardino freeway but is in certain ways an alien place:  not the coastal  the california ofsubtropical twilights and the soft westerlies off the pacific but a harsher california, haunted by the mohave just beyond the mountains, devastated by the hot dry santa ana wind that comes down through the passes at 100 miles an hour and whines through the eucalypts windbreaks and works on the nerves.  october is the bad month for the wind, the month when breathing is difficult and the hills blaze up spontaneously. there has been no rain since april.  every voice seems a scream.  it is the season of suicide and divorce and prickly dread, wherever the wind blows.  the mormons settled this ominous country, and then they abandoned it but by the time they left the first orange tree had been planted and for the next hundred years the san bernardino valley would draw a kind of people who imagined they might live among the talismanic fruit and prosper in die dry air, people who brought with them mid-western ways of building and cooking and praying and who tried to graft those ways upon the land.  the graft took incurious ways.  this is the california where it is possible to live and die without ever eating an artichoke, without ever meeting a catholic or a jew.  this is the california where it is easy to dial-a-devotion, but hard to buy a book.  this is the country in which a belief in the literal interpretation of genesis has slipped imperceptibly into a belief in the literal interpretation of double indemnity, the country of the teased hair and the capris and the girls for whom all life's promise comes down to a waltz-length white wedding dress and the birth of a kimberly or a sherry or a debbi and a tijuana divorce and return to hairdressers' school.  “we were just crazy kids” they say without regret, and look to the future.  the future always looks good in the golden land, because no one remembers the past.  here is where the hot wind blows and the old ways do not seem relevant, where the divorce rate is double the national average and where one person in every thirty-eight lives in a trailer.  here is the last stop for all those who  come from somewhere else, for all those who drifted away from the cold and the past and the old ways.  here is where they are trying to find a new life style, trying to find it in the only places they know to look:  the movies and the newspapers.  the case of lucille marie maxwell miller is a tabloid monument to that new life style.  imagine banyan street first, because banyan is where it happened. the way to banyan is to drive west from san bernardino out foothill boulevard, route 66:  past the santa fe switching yards, the forty winks motel.  past the motel that is nineteen stucco tepees:  ""sleep in a wigwam-get more for your wampum.""  past fontana drag city and the fontana church of the nazarene and the pit stop a go-go; past kaiser steel, through cucamonga, out to the kapu kai restaurant-bar and coffee shop, at the corner of route 66 and carnelian avenue.  up carnelian avenue from the kapu kai, which means ""forbidden seas,"" the subdivision flags whip in the harsh wind.  ""half-acre ranches!  snack bars! travertine entries!  $95 down.""  it is the trail of an intention gone haywire, the flotsam of the new california.  but after awhile the signs thin out on carnelian avenue, and the houses are no longer the bright pastels of the springtime home owners but the faded bungalows of the people who grow a few grapes and keep a few chickens out here, and then the hill gets steeper and the road climbs and even the bungalows are few, and here desolate, roughly surfaced, lined with eucalyptus and lemon groves---is banyan street.  like so much of this country, banyan suggests something curious and unnatural. the lemon groves are sunken, down a three- or four-foot retaining wall, so that one looks directly into their dense foliage, too lush, unsettlingly  glossy, the greenery of nightmare; the fallen eucalyptus bark is too dusty, a place for snakes to breed.  the stones look not like natural stones but like the rubble of some unmentioned upheaval.  there are smudge pots, and a closed cistern.  to one side of banyan there the flat valley, and to the other the san bernardino mountains, a dark mass looming too high, too fist, nine, ten, eleven thousand feet, right there above the lemon groves.  at midnight on banyan street there is no light at all, and no sound except the wind in the eucalyptus and a muffled barking of dogs.  there may be a kennel somewhere, or the dogs may be coyotes.  banyan street was the route lucille miller took home from the twenty-four hour mayfair market on the night of october 7, 1969, a night when the moon was dark and the wind was blowing and she was out of milk, and banyan street was where, at about 12:30 a.m., her 1964 volkswagen came to a sudden stop, caught fire, and began to burn.  for an hour and fifteen minutes lucille miller ran up and down banyan calling for help, but no cars passed and no help came.  at three o'clock that morning, when the fire had been put out and the california highway patrol officers were completing their report, lucille miller was still sobbing and incoherent, for her husband had been asleep in the volkswagen.  ""what will i tell the children, when there's nothing left, nothing left in the casket:' she cried to the friend called to comfort her.  ""how can i tell them there's nothing left?"" in fact there was something left, and a week later it lay in the draper mortuary chapel in a closed bronze coffin blanketed with pink carnations.  some 200 mourners heard elder robert e. denton of the seventh-day adventist church of ontario speak of ""the temper of fury that has broken out among us.""  for gordon miller, he said, there would be ""no more death, no more heartache, and no more misunderstandings.""  elder ansel bristol mentioned the ""peculiar"" grief of the hour.  elder fred jensen asked ""what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?""  a light rain fell, a blessing in a dry season, and a female vocalist sang ""safe in the arms of jesus.""  a tape recording of the service was made for the widow, who was being held without bail in the san bernardino county jail on a charge of first-degree murder.  of course she came from somewhere else, came off the prairie, in search of something she had seen in a movie or heard on the radio.  for this is a southern california story.  she was born on january 17, 1930, in winnipeg, manitoba, the only child of gordon and lily maxwell, both school teachers hers and both dedicated to the  seventh-day adventist church whose members observe the sabbath on saturday, believe in an apocalyptic second coming, have a strong missionary tendency, and, if they are strict, do not smoke, drink, eat meat, use makeup, or wear jewelry, including wedding rings.  by the time lucille maxwell enrolled at walla walla college in college place, washington, the adventist school where her parents then taught, she was an eighteen-year-old possessed of unremarkable good looks and remarkable high spirits.  ""lucille wanted to see the world,"" her father would say in retrospect, ""and i guess she found out.""  the high spirits did not seem to lend themselves to an extended course of study at walla walla college and in the spring of 1949 licille-maxwell met and married gorgon (""cork"") miller, a twenty-four-year-old graduate of walla walla and of the university of oregon dental school, then stationed at fort lewis as a medical officer.  ""maybe you could say it was love at first sight,"" mr. maxwell recalls.  ""before they were ever formally introduced, he sent lucille a dozen and a half roses with a card that said even if she didn't come out on a date with him, he hoped she'd find the roses pretty anyway."" the maxwells remember their daughter as a' ""radiant"" bride.  unhappy marriages so resemble one another that we do not need to know too much about the course of this one.  there may or may not have been trouble on guam, where cork and lucille miller lived while he finished his army duty.  there may or may not have been problems in the small oregon town where he first set up private practice.  there appears to have been some disappointment-about their move to california:  cork miller bad told friends that he wanted to become a doctor, that he was unhappy as a dentist and planned to enter the seventh-day adventist college of medical evangelists at loma linda, a few miles south of san bernardino. instead he bought a dental practice in the west end of san bernardino county, and the family settled there, in a modest house on the kind of street where there are always tricycles and revolving credit and dreams about bigger houses, better streets. that was 1957.  by the summer of 1964 they had achieved -the bigger house on the better street and the familiar accouterments of a family on its way up: the $30,000 a year, the three children for the christmas card, the picture window, the family room, the newspaper photographs that showed ""mrs. gordon miller, ontario heart fund chairman.""  they were paying the familiar price for it.  and they had reached the familiar season of divorce.  it might have been anyone’s bad summer, anyone's siege of heat and nerves and migraine and money worries, but this one began particularly early and particularly badly.  on april 24 an old friend, elaine hayton, died suddenly; lucille miller had seen her only the night before.  during the month of may, cork miller was hospitalized briefly with a bleeding ulcer, and his usual reserve deepened into depression.  he told his accountant that he was ""sick of looking at open mouths” and threatened suicide.  by july 8, the conventional tensions of love and money had reached the conventional impasse in the new house on the acre lot at 8488 bella vista, and lucille miller filed for divorce.  within a month, however, the millers seemed reconciled.  they saw a marriage counselor.  they talked about a fourth child.  it seemed that the marriage had reached the traditional truce, the  point at which so many resign themselves to cutting both their losses and their hopes.  but the millers' season of trouble was not to end that easily.  october 7 began as a commonplace enough day, one of those days that sets the teeth on edge with its tedium, its small frustrations.  the temperature reached 102 degrees in san bernardino that afternoon, and the miller children were home from school because of teachers' institute.  there was ironing to be dropped off.  there was a trip to pick up a prescription for nembutal, a trip to a self-service dry cleaner.  in the early evening, an unpleasant accident with the volkswagen:  cork miller hit and killed a german shepherd, and afterward said that his head felt “like it had a mack truck on it.”  it was something he often said.  as of that evening cork miller was $630,479 in debt, including the $29,637 mortgage on the new house, a debt load which seemed oppressive to him.  he was a man who wore his responsibilities uneasily, and complained of migraine headaches almost constantly.  he ate alone that night, from a tv tray in the living room.  later tile millers watched john forsythe and santa berger in see how they run, and when the movie ended, about eleven, cork miller suggested that they go out for milk.  he wanted some hot chocolate.  he took a blanket and pillow from the couch and climbed into the passenger seat of the volkswagen.  lucille miller remembers reaching over to lock his door as she backed down the driveway.  by the time she left tile mayfair market, and long before they reached banyan street, cork miller appeared to be asleep.  there is some confusion in lucille miller's mind about what happened between 12:30 a.m., when the fire broke out, and 1:50 a.m., when it was reported.  she says that she was driving east on banyan street at about 35 m.p.h. when she felt the volkswagen pull sharply to the right.  the next thing she knew the car was on the embankment, quite near the edge of the retaining wall, and flames were shooting up behind her.  she does not remember jumping out.  she does remember prying up a stone with which she broke the window next to her husband, and then scrambling down the retaining wall to try to find a stick.  ""i don't know how i was going to push him out,"" she says. ""i just thought if i had a stick, i'd push him out.""  she could not, and after a while she ran to the intersection of banyan and carnelian avenue.  there are no houses at that corner, and almost no traffic.  after one car had passed without stopping, lucille miller ran back down banyan toward tile burning volkswagen.  she did not stop, but she slowed down, and in the flames she could see her husband.  he was, she said, ""just black.""  at the first house up sapphire avenue, half a mile from the volkswagen, lucille miller finally found help.  there mrs. robert swenson called the sheriff, and then, at lucille miller's request, she called harold lance, the millers' lawyer and their close friend.  when harold lance arrived he took lucille miller home to his wife, joan.  twice harold lance and lucille miller returned to banyan street and talked to the highway patrol officers.  a third time harold lance returned alone, and when he came back he said to lucille miller, ""o.k....you don't talk any more.""  when lucille miller was arrested the next afternoon, sandy slagle was with her.  sandy slagle was the intense, relentlessly loyal medical student who used to baby-sit for the millers, and bad been living as a member of the family since she graduated from high school in 1959.  the millers took her away from a difficult home situation, and she thinks of lucille miller not only as ""more or less a mother or a sister"" but as ""the most wonderful character"" she has ever known.  on the night of the accident, sandy slagle was in her dormitory at loma linda university, but lucille miller called her early in the morning and asked her to come home.  the doctor was there when sandy slagle arrived, giving lucille miller an injection of nembutal.  ""she was crying as she was going under” sandy slagle recalls. ""over and over she'd say,  'sandy, all the hours i spent trying to save him and now what are they trying to do to me?’""  at 1:30 that afternoon, sergeant william paterson and detectives charles callahan and joseph karr of the central homicide division arrived at 8488 bella vista.  ""one of them appeared at the bedroom door:  sandy slagle remembers ""and said to lucille, 'you've got ten minutes to get dressed or we'll take you as you are.’ she was in her night gown, you know, so i tried to get her dressed.""  sandy slagle tells the story now as if by rote and her eyes do no waver.  ""so i had her panties and bra on her and they opened the door again, so i got some capris on her, you know, and a scarf.""  her voice drops.  ""and then they just took her.""  the arrest took place just twelve hours after the first report that there had been an accident on banyan street, a rapidity which would later prompt lucille miller’s attorney to say that the entire case was an instance of trying to justify a reckless arrest.  actually what first caused the detectives who arrived on banyan street toward dawn that morning to give the accident more than routine attention were certain apparent physical inconsistencies.  while lucille miller had said that she was driving about 35 m.p.h. when the car swerved to a stop, an examination of the cooling volkswagen showed that it was in low gear, and that the parking rather than the driving lights were on.  the front wheels, moreover, did not seem to be in exactly the position that lucille miller's description of the accident would suggest, and the right rear wheel was dug in deep, as if it had been spun in place.  it seemed curious to the detectives, too, that a sudden stop from 35 m.p.h.—the same jolt which was presumed to have knocked over a gasoline can in the back seat and somehow started the fire—should have left two milk cartons up right on the back floorboard, and the remains of a polaroid camera box lying apparently undisturbed on the back seat. no one, however, could be expected to give a precise account of what did and did not happen in a moment of terror, and none of these inconsistencies seemed in themselves incontrovertible evidence of criminal intent.  but they did interest the sheriffs office, as did gordon miller's apparent unconsciousness at the time of the accident, and the length of time it had taken lucille miller to get help.  something, moreover, struck the investigators as wrong about harold lance's attitude when he came back to banyan street the third time and found the investigation by no means over.  ""the way lance was acting,"" the prosecuting attorney said later, ""they thought maybe they'd hit a nerve.""  and so it was that on the morning of october 8, even before the doctor had come to give lucille miller an injection to calm her, the san bernardino county sheriffs office was trying to construct another version of what might have happened between 12:30 and 1: 50 a.m.  the hypothesis they would eventually present was based on the somewhat tortuous premise that lucille miller had undertaken a plan which failed: a plan to stop the car on the lonely road, spread gasoline over her presumably drugged husband, and, with a stick on the accelerator, gently ""walk"" the volkswagen over the embankment, where it would tumble four feet down the retaining wall into the lemon grove and almost certainly explode.  if this happened, lucille miller might then have somehow negotiated the two miles up carnelian to bella vista in time to be home when the accident was discovered.  this plan went awry, according to the sheriff's office hypothesis, when the car would not go over the rise of the embankment.  lucille miller might have panicked then—after she had killed the engine the third or fourth time, say, out there on the dark road with the gasoline already spread and the dogs baying and the wind blowing and the unspeakable apprehension that a pair of headlights would suddenly light up banyan street and expose her there—and set the fire herself.  although this version accounted for some of the physical evidence, the car in low because it had been started from a dead stop, the parking lights on because she could not do what needed doing without some light, a rear wheel spun in repeated attempts to get the car over the embankment, the milk cartons upright because there had been no sudden stop—it did not seem on its own any more or less credible than lucille miller's own story.  moreover, some of the physical evidence did seem to support her story: a nail in a front tire, a nine-pound rock found in the car, presumably the one with which she had broken the window in an attempt to save her husband.  within a few days an autopsy had established that gordon miller was alive when he burned, which did not particularly help the state's case, and that he had enough nembutal and sandoptal in his blood to put the average person to sleep, which did: on the other hand gordon miller habitually took both nembutal and fiorinal (a common headache prescription which contains sandoptal), and had been ill besides.  it was a spotty case, and to make it work at all the state was going to have to find a motive.  these was talk of unhappiness, talk of another man.  that kind of motive, during the next few weeks, was what they set out to establish.   they set out to find it in accountants’ ledgers and double-indemnity clauses and motel registers, set out to determine what might move a woman who believed in all the promises of  the middle class—a woman who had been  chairman of the heart fund and who always knew a reasonable little dressmaker—and who had come out of the bleak wild of prairie fundamentalism to find what she imagined to be the good life—what would drive such a woman to sit on  street called bella vista and look out her new picture window into the empty california sun and calculate how to burn her husband alive in a volkswagen.   they found the wedge they wanted closer at hand than they might have at first expected, for, as testimony would reveal later at the trial, it seemed that in december of 1963 lucille miller had begun an affair with the husband of one of her friends, a man whose daughter called her ""auntie lucille,"" a man who might have seemed to have the gift for people and money and the good life that cork miller so noticeably lacked.  the man was arthwell hayton, a well-known san bernardino attorney and at one time a member of the district attorney's staff.  in some ways it was the conventional clandestine affair in a place like san bernardino, a place where little is bright or graceful, where it is routine to misplace the future and easy to start looking for it in bed.  over the seven weeks that it would take to try lucille miller for murder, assistant district attorney don a. turner and defense attorney edward p. foley would between them unfold a curiously predictable story.  there were the falsified motel registrations.  there were the lunch dates, the afternoon drives in arthwell hayton's red cadillac convertible.  there were the interminable discussions of the wronged partners.  there were the confidantes (""i knew everything,"" sandy slagle would insist fiercely later.  ""i knew every time, places, everything')  and there were the words remembered from bad magazine stories (""don't kiss me, it will trigger things,"" lucille miller remembered telling arthwell hayton in the parking lot of harold's club in fontana after lunch one day) and there were the notes, the sweet exchanges: ""hi sweetie pie!  you are my cup of teal!  happy birthday—you don't look a day over 29!!  your baby, arthwell.""  and, toward the end, there was the acrimony.  it was april 24, 1964, when arthwell hayton's wife, elaine, died suddenly, and nothing good happened after that.  arthwell hayton had taken his cruiser, captain’s lady, over to catalina that weekend; he called home at nine o'clock friday night, but did not talk to his wife because lucille miller answered the telephone and said that elaine was showering.  the next morning the haytons' daughter found her mother in bed, dead.  the newspapers reported the death as accidental, perhaps the result of an allergy to hair spray.  when arthwell hayton flew home from catalina that weekend, lucille miller met him at the airport, but the finish had already been written.  it was in the breakup that the affair ceased to be in the conventional mode and began to resemble instead the novels of james m. cain, the movies of the late 30s, all the dreams in which violence and threats and blackmail are made to seem commonplaces of middle-class life.  what was most startling about the case the state of california was preparing against lucille miller was something that had nothing to do with law at all, something that never appeared in the eight-column afternoon headlines but was always there between them: the revelation that the dream was teaching the dreamers how to live.  here is lucille miller talking to her lover sometime in the early summer of 1964, after, he had indicated that, on the advice of his minister, he did not intend to see her any more:  ""first, i'm going to go to that dear pastor of yours and tell him a few things.... when i do tell him that, you won't be in the redlands church any more... look, sonny boy, if you think your reputation is going to be ruined, your life won't be worth two cents.""  here is arthwell hayton, to lucille miller: ""i'll go to sheriff  frank bland and tell him some things that i know about you until you'll wish you'd never heard of arthwell hayton.'  for an affair between a seventh-day adventist dentist's wife and a seventh-day adventist personal-injury lawyer, it seems a curious kind of dialogue.  ""boy, i could get that little boy coming and going,"" lucille miller later confided to erwin sprengle, a riverside contractor who was a business partner of arthwell hayton's and a friend to both the lovers.  (friend or no, on this occasion he happened to have an induction coil attached to his telephone in order to tape lucille miller's call.)  ""and he hasn't got one thing on me that he can prove.  i mean, i've got concrete has nothing concrete.""   in the same taped conversation with erwin sprengle, lucille miller mentioned a tape that she herself had surreptitiously made, months before, in arthwell hayton's car.  ""i said to him, i said 'arthwell, i just feel like i'm being used!  . . he started sucking his thumb and he said i love you. . . . this isn't something that happened yesterday.  i'd marry you tomorrow if i could.  i don't love elaine.' he'd love to. hear that played back, wouldn't he?""  ""yeah:' drawled sprengle's voice on the tape.  ""that would be just a little incriminating, wouldn't it?""  ""just a little incriminating,' lucille miller agreed.  ""it really is.""  later on the tape, sprengle asked where cork miller was. ""he took the children down to the church."" ""you didn't go?"" no."" ""you're naughty.""  it was all, moreover, in the name of “love”; everyone involved placed a magical faith in the efficacy of the very word.  there was the significance that lucille miller saw in arthwell's saying that he ""loved"" her, that he did not ""love"" elaine.  there was arthwell insisting, later, at the trial, that he had never said it, that he may have ""whispered sweet nothings in her ear"" (as her defense hinted that he had whispered in many ears), but he did not remember bestowing upon her the special seal, saying the word, declaring ""love.""   there was the summer evening when lucille miller and sandy slagle followed arthwell hayton down to his new boat in its mooring at newport beach and untied the lines with arthwell aboard, arthwell and a girl with whom he later testified he was drinking hot chocolate and watching television.  “i did that on purpose,” lucille miller told erwin sprengle later, ""to save myself from letting my heart do something crazy.""  january 11, 1965, was a bright warm day in southern california, the kind of day when catalina floats on the pacific horizon and the air smells of orange blossoms and it is a long way from the bleak and difficult east, a long way from the cold, a long way from the past.  a woman in hollywood staged an all-night sit-in on the hood of her car to prevent repossession by a finance company.  a seventy-year-old pensioner drove his station wagon at five miles an hour past three gardena poker parlors and emptied three pistols and a twelve-gauge shotgun through their windows, wounding twenty-nine people.  ""many young women become prostitutes just to have enough money to play cards,"" he explained in a note.  mrs. nick adams said that she was ""not surprised"" to hear her husband announce his divorce plans on the les crane show, and, farther north, a sixteen-year-old jumped off the golden gate bridge and lived.  and, in the san bernardino county courthouse, the miller trial opened.  the crowds were so bad that the glass courtroom doors were shattered in the crush, and from then on identification disks were issued to the first forty-three spectators in line.  the line began forming at 6 a.m., and college girls camped at the courthouse all night, with stores of graham crackers and no-cal.  all they were doing was picking a jury, those first few days, but the sensational nature of the case had already suggested itself.  early in december there had been an abortive first trial, a trial at which no evidence was ever presented because on the day the jury was seated the san bernardino sun-telegram ran an ""inside"" story quoting assistant district attorney don turner, the prosecutor, as saying, ""we are looking into the circumstances of mrs. hayton's death.  in view of the current trial concerning the death of dr. miller, i do not feel i should comment on mrs. hayton's death.""  it seemed that there had been barbiturates in elaine hayton's blood, and there had seemed some irregularity about the way she was dressed on that morning when she was found under the covers, dead. any doubts about the death at the time, however, had never gotten as far as the sheriff's office.  ""i guess somebody didn't want to rock the boat,"" turner said later.  “these were prominent, people.”  although all of that had not been in the sun-telegram’s story, an immediate mistrial had been declared.  almost as immediately, there had been another development: arthwell hayton had asked newspapermen to an 11 a.m. sunday morning press conference in his office.  there had been television cameras, and flash bulbs popping.  ""as you gentlemen may know,"" hayton had said, striking a note of stiff bonhomie, ""there are very often women who become amorous toward their doctor or lawyer. this does not mean on the physician's or lawyer’s part that there is any romance toward the patient or client."" ""would you deny that you were having an affair with mrs. miller?"" a reporter had asked. ""i would deny that there was any romance on my part whatsoever.""  it was a distinction he would maintain through all the wearing weeks to come.  so they had come to see arthwell, these crowds who now milled beneath the dusty palm outside the courthouse, and they had also come to see lucille, who appeared as a slight, intermittently pretty woman, already pale from lack of sun, a woman who would turn thirty-five before the trial was over and whose tendency toward haggardness was beginning to show. a meticulous woman who insisted against her lawyer's advice, on coming to court with her hair piled high and lacquered.  “i would've been happy if she'd come in with it hinging loose, but lucille wouldn't do that,” her lawyer said.  he was edward p. foley, a small, emotional irish catholic who several times wept in the courtroom.  “she his a great honesty, this woman,” he added, “but this honesty about her appearance always worked against her.”  by the time the trial opened, lucille miller's appearance included maternity clothes, for an official examination on december 18 had revealed that she was then three and a half months pregnant, a fact which made picking a jury even more difficult than usual, for turner was asking the death penalty.  ""it's unfortunate but there it is,"" he would say of the pregnancy to each juror in turn, and finally twelve were seated, seven of them women, the youngest forty-one, an assembly of the he very peers—housewives, a machinist, a truck driver, a grocery-store manager, a filing clerk—above whom lucille miller had wanted so badly to rise.  that was the     sin more than the adultery, which tended to reinforce the one for which she was being tried.  it was implicit in booth the defense and the prosecution that lucille miller was an erring woman, a woman who perhaps wanted too much.  but to the prosecution she was not merely a woman who would want a new house and want to go to parties and run up high telephone bills ($1152 in two months), but a woman who would go so far as to murder her husband for his $80,000 in insurance, making it appear an accident in order to collect another $40,000 in double indemnity and straight accident policies.  to turner she was a woman who did not want simply her freedom and a reasonable alimony (she could have had that, the defense contended, by going through with her divorce suit), but wanted everything, a woman motivated by ""love and greed.""  she was a ""manipulator.""  she was a user of people.""  to edward foley, on the other hand, she was an impulsive woman who ""couldn't control her foolish little heart.""  where turner skirted the pregnancy, foley dwelt upon it, even calling the dead man's mother down from washington to testify that her son had told her they were going to have another baby because lucille felt that it would ""do much to weld our home again in the pleasant relations that we used to have.""  where the prosecution saw a ""calculator,"" the defense saw a ""blabbermouth,"" and in fact lucille miller did emerge as an ingenuous conversationalist.  just as, before her husband's death, she had confided in her friends about her love affair, so she chatted about it after his death, with the arresting sergeant.  ""of course cork lived with it for years, you know,"" her voice was heard to tell sergeant paterson on a tape made the morning after her arrest.  ""after elaine died, he pushed the panic button one night and just asked me right out, and that, i  think, was when he really—the first time he really faced it.""  when the sergeant asked why she had agreed to talk to him, against the specific instructions of her lawyers, lucille miller said airily, ""oh, i've always been basically quite an honest person. . . . i mean i can put a hat in the cupboard and say it cost ten dollars less, but basically i've always kind of just lived my life the way i wanted to, and if you don't like it you can take off.""  the prosecution hinted at men other than arthwell, and even, over foley's objections, managed to name one.  the defense called miller suicidal.  the prosecution produced experts who said that the volkswagen fire could not have been accidental.  foley produced witnesses who said that it could have been.  lucille's father, now a junior-high-school teacher in oregon, quoted isaiah to reporters: ""every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.""  ""lucille did wrong, her affair,"" her mother said judiciously.  ""with her it was love.  but with some i guess it's just passion.""  there was debbie, the millers' fourteen-year-old, testifying in a steady voice about how she and her mother had gone to a supermarket to buy the gasoline can the week before the accident.  there was sandy slagle, in the courtroom every day, declaring that on at least one occasion lucille miller had prevented her husband not only from committing suicide but from committing suicide in such a way that it would appear an accident and ensure the double-indemnity payment.  there was wenche berg, the pretty twenty-seven-year-old norwegian governess to arthwell hayton's children, testifying that arthwell had instructed her not to allow lucille miller to see or talk to the children.  two months dragged by, and the headlines never stopped.  southern california's crime reporters were headquartered in san bernardino for the duration: howard hertel from the time, jim bennett and eddy jo bernal from the herald-examiner.  two months in which the miller trial was pushed off the examiner front page only by the academy award nominations and stan laurel's death.  and finally, on march 2, after turner had reiterated that it was a case of ""love and greed,"" and foley had protested that his client was being tried for adultery, the case went to the jury.  they brought in the verdict, guilty of murder in the first degree, at 4:50 p.m. on march 5.  ""she didn't do it,"" debbie miller cried, jumping up from the spectators' section.  ""she didn't do it.""  sandy slagle collapsed in her seat and began to scream.  ""sandy, for god's sake please don’t,"" lucille miller said in a voice that carried across the courtroom, and sandy slagle was momentarily subdued.  but as the jurors left the courtroom she screamed again: ""you're murderers. . . . every last one of you is a murderer.""  sheriff's deputies moved in then, each wearing a string tie that read ""1965 sheriff's rodeo,"" and lucille miller's father, that sad-faced junior-high-school teacher who believed in the word of christ and the dangers of wanting to see the world, blew her a kiss off his fingertips.  the california institution for women at frontera, where lucille miller is now, lies down where euclid avenue turns into country road, not too many miles from where she once lived and shopped and organized the heart fund ball.  cattle graze across the road, and rainbirds sprinkle the alfalfa.  frontera has a softball field and tennis courts, and looks as if it might be a california junior college, except that the trees are not yet high enough to conceal the concertina wire around the top of the cyclone fence.  on visitors' day there are big cars in the parking area, big buicks and pontiacs that belong to grandparents and sisters and fathers (not many of them belong to husbands), and some of them have bumper stickers that say ""support your local police.""  a lot of california murderesses live here, a lot of girls who somehow misunderstood the promise.  don turner put sandra garner here (and her husband in the gas chamber at san quentin) after the 1959 desert killings known to crime reporters as ""the soda pop murders.""  carole tregoff is here, and has been ever since she was convicted of conspiring to murder dr. finch's wife in west covina, which is not too far from san bernardino.  carole tregoff is in fact a nurse's aide in the prison hospital, and might have attended lucille miller had her baby been born at frontera; lucille miller chose instead to have it outside, and paid for the guard who stood outside the delivery room in st. bernadine’s hospital.  debbie miller came to take the baby home from the hospital, in a white dress with pink ribbons, and debbie was allowed to choose a name.  she named the baby kimi kai.  the children live with harold and joan lance now, because lucille miller will probably spend ten years at frontera.  don turner waived his original request for the death penalty (it was generally agreed that he had demanded it only, in edward foley's words, ""to get anybody with the slightest trace of human kindness in their veins off the jury""), and settled for life imprisonment with the possibility of parole.  lucille miller does not like it at frontera, and has had trouble adjusting.  ""she's going to have to learn humility;' turner says.  ""she's going to have to use her ability to charm, to manipulate.""  the new house is empty now, the house on the street with the sign that says  private road bella vista dead end  the millers never did get it landscaped, and weeds grow up around the field. stone siding.  the television aerial has toppled on the roof, and a trash can is stuffed with the debris of family life—a cheap suitcase, a child’s game called “lie detector.”  there is a sign on what would have been the lawn, and the sign reads “estate sale.”  edward foley is trying to get lucille miller's case appealed, but there have been delays. ""a trial always comes down to a matter of sympathy,” foley says wearily now.  i couldn't create sympathy for her.”   everyone is a little weary now, weary and resigned, everyone except sandy slagle, whose bitterness is still raw.  she lives in an apartment near the medical school in loma linda, and studies reports of the case in true police cases and official detective stories.  ""i'd much rather we not talk about the hayton business too much,""' she tells visitors, and she keeps a tape recorder running.  ""1’d rather talk about lucille and what a wonderful person she is and how her rights were violated.""  harold lance does not talk to visitors at all.  ""we don't want to give away what we can sell,” he explains pleasantly; an attempt was made to sell lucille miller’s personal story to life, but life did not want to buy it.  in the district attorney's offices they are prosecuting other murders now, and do not see why the miller trial attracted so much attention.  ""it wasn’t a very interesting murder as murders go,"" don turner says laconically.  elaine hayton's death is no longer under investigation.  ""we know everything we want to know,” turner says.  arthwell hayton's office is directly below edward foleys.  some people around san bernardino say that arthwell hayton suffered; others say that he did not suffer at all.  perhaps he did not, for time past is not believed to have any bearing upon time present or future, out in the golden land where every day the world is born anew.  in any case, on october 17, 1965, arthwell hayton married again, married his children’s pretty governess, wenche berg, at a service in the chapel of the roses at a retirement village near riverside. later the newlyweds were feted at a reception for seventy-five in the dining room of rose garden village.  the bridegroom was in black tie, with a white carnation in his buttonhole.  the bride wore a long white peau de soie dress and carried a shower bouquet of sweetheart roses with stephanotis streamers.  a coronet of seed pearls held her illusion veil.embed"

'they met me in the day of success: and i have 345 learned by the perfectest report, they have more in them than mortal knowledge. when i burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. whiles i stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who 350 all-hailed me 'thane of cawdor;' by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with 'hail, king that shalt be!' this have i thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou 355 mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. lay it to thy heart, and farewell.' glamis thou art, and cawdor; and shalt be what thou art promised: yet do i fear thy nature; 360 it is too full o' the milk of human kindness to catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great; art not without ambition, but without the illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly, that wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, 365 and yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great glamis, that which cries 'thus thou must do, if thou have it; and that which rather thou dost fear to do than wishest should be undone.' hie thee hither, that i may pour my spirits in thine ear; 370 and chastise with the valour of my tongue all that impedes thee from the golden round, which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem to have thee crown'd withal.   375 what is your tidings?

lady macbeth. he has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber? macbeth. hath he ask'd for me? 505lady macbeth. know you not he has? macbeth. we will proceed no further in this business: he hath honour'd me of late; and i have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people, which would be worn now in their newest gloss, 510 not cast aside so soon. lady macbeth. was the hope drunk wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since? and wakes it now, to look so green and pale at what it did so freely? from this time 515 such i account thy love. art thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valour as thou art in desire? wouldst thou have that which thou esteem'st the ornament of life, and live a coward in thine own esteem, 520 letting 'i dare not' wait upon 'i would,' like the poor cat i' the adage? macbeth. prithee, peace: i dare do all that may become a man; who dares do more is none. 525lady macbeth. what beast was't, then, that made you break this enterprise to me? when you durst do it, then you were a man; and, to be more than what you were, you would be so much more the man. nor time nor place 530 did then adhere, and yet you would make both: they have made themselves, and that their fitness now does unmake you. i have given suck, and know how tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me: i would, while it was smiling in my face, 535 have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums, and dash'd the brains out, had i so sworn as you have done to this. macbeth. if we should fail? lady macbeth. we fail! 540 but screw your courage to the sticking-place, and we'll not fail. when duncan is asleep— whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey soundly invite him—his two chamberlains will i with wine and wassail so convince 545 that memory, the warder of the brain, shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason a limbeck only: when in swinish sleep their drenched natures lie as in a death, what cannot you and i perform upon 550 the unguarded duncan? what not put upon his spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt of our great quell? macbeth. bring forth men-children only; for thy undaunted mettle should compose 555 nothing but males. will it not be received, when we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers, that they have done't? lady macbeth. who dares receive it other, 560 as we shall make our griefs and clamour roar upon his death? macbeth. i am settled, and bend up each corporal agent to this terrible feat. away, and mock the time with fairest show: 565 false face must hide what the false heart doth know.      previous scene         act ii, scene 1  court of macbeth’s castle. next scene      banquo. how goes the night, boy?

macbeth. a friend. banquo. what, sir, not yet at rest? the king's a-bed: he hath been in unusual pleasure, and sent forth great largess to your offices. 585 this diamond he greets your wife withal, by the name of most kind hostess; and shut up in measureless content. macbeth. being unprepared, our will became the servant to defect; 590 which else should free have wrought. banquo. all's well. i dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: to you they have show'd some truth. macbeth. i think not of them: 595 yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, we would spend it in some words upon that business, if you would grant the time. banquo. at your kind'st leisure. macbeth. if you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis, 600 it shall make honour for you. banquo. so i lose none in seeking to augment it, but still keep my bosom franchised and allegiance clear, i shall be counsell'd. 605macbeth. good repose the while! banquo. thanks, sir: the like to you!    macbeth. go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready, she strike upon the bell. get thee to bed. 610   is this a dagger which i see before me, the handle toward my hand? come, let me clutch thee. i have thee not, and yet i see thee still. art thou not, fatal vision, sensible 615 to feeling as to sight? or art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation, proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? i see thee yet, in form as palpable as this which now i draw. 620 thou marshall'st me the way that i was going; and such an instrument i was to use. mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses, or else worth all the rest; i see thee still, and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, 625 which was not so before. there's no such thing: it is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes. now o'er the one halfworld nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse the curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates 630 pale hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder, alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf, whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace. with tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design moves like a ghost. thou sure and firm-set earth, 635 hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout, and take the present horror from the time, which now suits with it. whiles i threat, he lives: words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. 640   i go, and it is done; the bell invites me. hear it not, duncan; for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell.      previous scene         act ii, scene 2  the same. next scene      lady macbeth. that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold; what hath quench'd them hath given me fire. hark! peace! it was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman, 650 which gives the stern'st good-night. he is about it: the doors are open; and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores: i have drugg'd their possets, that death and nature do contend about them, 655 whether they live or die. macbeth.   who's there? what, ho! lady macbeth. alack, i am afraid they have awaked, and 'tis not done. the attempt and not the deed confounds us. hark! i laid their daggers ready; 660 he could not miss 'em. had he not resembled my father as he slept, i had done't.   my husband! macbeth. i have done the deed. didst thou not hear a noise? 665lady macbeth. i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. did not you speak? macbeth. when? lady macbeth. now. macbeth. as i descended? 670lady macbeth. ay. macbeth. hark! who lies i' the second chamber? lady macbeth. donalbain. macbeth. this is a sorry sight. 675   lady macbeth. a foolish thought, to say a sorry sight. macbeth. there's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried 'murder!' that they did wake each other: i stood and heard them: 680 but they did say their prayers, and address'd them again to sleep. lady macbeth. there are two lodged together. macbeth. one cried 'god bless us!' and 'amen' the other; as they had seen me with these hangman's hands. 685 listening their fear, i could not say 'amen,' when they did say 'god bless us!' lady macbeth. consider it not so deeply. macbeth. but wherefore could not i pronounce 'amen'? i had most need of blessing, and 'amen' 690 stuck in my throat. lady macbeth. these deeds must not be thought after these ways; so, it will make us mad. macbeth. methought i heard a voice cry 'sleep no more! macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep, 695 sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care, the death of each day's life, sore labour's bath, balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast,— lady macbeth. what do you mean? 700macbeth. still it cried 'sleep no more!' to all the house: 'glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore cawdor shall sleep no more; macbeth shall sleep no more.' lady macbeth. who was it that thus cried? why, worthy thane, you do unbend your noble strength, to think 705 so brainsickly of things. go get some water, and wash this filthy witness from your hand. why did you bring these daggers from the place? they must lie there: go carry them; and smear the sleepy grooms with blood. 710macbeth. i'll go no more: i am afraid to think what i have done; look on't again i dare not. lady macbeth. infirm of purpose! give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead 715 are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood that fears a painted devil. if he do bleed, i'll gild the faces of the grooms withal; for it must seem their guilt.    macbeth. whence is that knocking? how is't with me, when every noise appals me? what hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes. will all great neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand? no, this my hand will rather 725 the multitudinous seas in incarnadine, making the green one red.    lady macbeth. my hands are of your colour; but i shame to wear a heart so white. 730   i hear a knocking at the south entry: retire we to our chamber; a little water clears us of this deed: how easy is it, then! your constancy 735 hath left you unattended.   hark! more knocking. get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us, and show us to be watchers. be not lost 740 so poorly in your thoughts. macbeth. to know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.   wake duncan with thy knocking! i would thou couldst!      previous scene         act ii, scene 3  the same. next scene      porter. here's a knocking indeed! if a man were porter of hell-gate, he should have old turning the key.   750 knock, knock, knock! who's there, i' the name of beelzebub? here's a farmer, that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you; here 755 you'll sweat for't.   knock, knock! who's there, in the other devil's name? faith, here's an equivocator, that could 760 swear in both the scales against either scale; who committed treason enough for god's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: o, come in, equivocator.   765 knock, knock, knock! who's there? faith, here's an english tailor come hither, for stealing out of a french hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. 770   knock, knock; never at quiet! what are you? but this place is too cold for hell. i'll devil-porter it no further: i had thought to have let in 775 some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire.   anon, anon! i pray you, remember the porter.       macduff. was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, that you do lie so late? porter. 'faith sir, we were carousing till the second cock: and drink, sir, is a great 785 provoker of three things. macduff. what three things does drink especially provoke? porter. marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes 790 away the performance: therefore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and 795 not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him. macduff. i believe drink gave thee the lie last night. porter. that it did, sir, i' the very throat on me: but i requited him for his lie; and, i 800 think, being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet i made a shift to cast him. macduff. is thy master stirring?   805 our knocking has awaked him; here he comes. lennox. good morrow, noble sir. macbeth. good morrow, both. macduff. is the king stirring, worthy thane? macbeth. not yet. 810macduff. he did command me to call timely on him: i have almost slipp'd the hour. macbeth. i'll bring you to him. macduff. i know this is a joyful trouble to you; but yet 'tis one. 815macbeth. the labour we delight in physics pain. this is the door. macduff. i'll make so bold to call, for 'tis my limited service.    lennox. goes the king hence to-day? macbeth. he does: he did appoint so. lennox. the night has been unruly: where we lay, our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say, lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death, 825 and prophesying with accents terrible of dire combustion and confused events new hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth was feverous and did shake. 830macbeth. 'twas a rough night. lennox. my young remembrance cannot parallel a fellow to it.    macduff. o horror, horror, horror! tongue nor heart 835 cannot conceive nor name thee! macbeth.   what's the matter. macduff. confusion now hath made his masterpiece! most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope the lord's anointed temple, and stole thence 840 the life o' the building! macbeth. what is 't you say? the life? lennox. mean you his majesty? macduff. approach the chamber, and destroy your sight with a new gorgon: do not bid me speak; 845 see, and then speak yourselves.   awake, awake! ring the alarum-bell. murder and treason! banquo and donalbain! malcolm! awake! 850 shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit, and look on death itself! up, up, and see the great doom's image! malcolm! banquo! as from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites, to countenance this horror! ring the bell. 855      lady macbeth. what's the business, that such a hideous trumpet calls to parley the sleepers of the house? speak, speak! 860macduff. o gentle lady, 'tis not for you to hear what i can speak: the repetition, in a woman's ear, would murder as it fell.   865 o banquo, banquo, our royal master 's murder'd! lady macbeth. woe, alas! what, in our house? banquo. too cruel any where. 870 dear duff, i prithee, contradict thyself, and say it is not so.    macbeth. had i but died an hour before this chance, i had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant, 875 there 's nothing serious in mortality: all is but toys: renown and grace is dead; the wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees is left this vault to brag of.    donalbain. what is amiss? macbeth. you are, and do not know't: the spring, the head, the fountain of your blood is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd. macduff. your royal father 's murder'd. 885malcolm. o, by whom? lennox. those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't: their hands and faces were an badged with blood; so were their daggers, which unwiped we found upon their pillows: 890 they stared, and were distracted; no man's life was to be trusted with them. macbeth. o, yet i do repent me of my fury, that i did kill them. macduff. wherefore did you so? 895macbeth. who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious, loyal and neutral, in a moment? no man: the expedition my violent love outrun the pauser, reason. here lay duncan, his silver skin laced with his golden blood; 900 and his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature for ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers, steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain, that had a heart to love, and in that heart 905 courage to make 's love known? lady macbeth. help me hence, ho! macduff. look to the lady. malcolm.   why do we hold our tongues, that most may claim this argument for ours? 910donalbain.   what should be spoken here, where our fate, hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us? let 's away; our tears are not yet brew'd. 915malcolm.   nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion. banquo. look to the lady:   and when we have our naked frailties hid, 920 that suffer in exposure, let us meet, and question this most bloody piece of work, to know it further. fears and scruples shake us: in the great hand of god i stand; and thence against the undivulged pretence i fight 925 of treasonous malice. macduff. and so do i. all. so all. macbeth. let's briefly put on manly readiness, and meet i' the hall together. 930all. well contented.    malcolm. what will you do? let's not consort with them: to show an unfelt sorrow is an office which the false man does easy. i'll to england. 935donalbain. to ireland, i; our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer: where we are, there's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood, the nearer bloody. malcolm. this murderous shaft that's shot 940 hath not yet lighted, and our safest way is to avoid the aim. therefore, to horse; and let us not be dainty of leave-taking, but shift away: there's warrant in that theft which steals itself, when there's no mercy left. 945     previous scene         act ii, scene 4  outside macbeth’s castle. next scene      old man. threescore and ten i can remember well: within the volume of which time i have seen hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night 950 hath trifled former knowings. ross. ah, good father, thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act, threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day, and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp: 955 is't night's predominance, or the day's shame, that darkness does the face of earth entomb, when living light should kiss it? old man. 'tis unnatural, even like the deed that's done. on tuesday last, 960 a falcon, towering in her pride of place, was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd. ross. and duncan's horses—a thing most strange and certain— beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out, 965 contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make war with mankind. old man. 'tis said they eat each other. ross. they did so, to the amazement of mine eyes that look'd upon't. here comes the good macduff. 970   how goes the world, sir, now? macduff. why, see you not? ross. is't known who did this more than bloody deed? macduff. those that macbeth hath slain. 975ross. alas, the day! what good could they pretend? macduff. they were suborn'd: malcolm and donalbain, the king's two sons, are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them 980 suspicion of the deed. ross. 'gainst nature still! thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up thine own life's means! then 'tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth. 985macduff. he is already named, and gone to scone to be invested. ross. where is duncan's body? macduff. carried to colmekill, the sacred storehouse of his predecessors, 990 and guardian of their bones. ross. will you to scone? macduff. no, cousin, i'll to fife. ross. well, i will thither. macduff. well, may you see things well done there: adieu! 995 lest our old robes sit easier than our new! ross. farewell, father. old man. god's benison go with you; and with those that would make good of bad, and friends of foes!      previous scene         act iii, scene 1  forres. the palace. next scene      banquo. thou hast it now: king, cawdor, glamis, all, as the weird women promised, and, i fear, thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said it should not stand in thy posterity, 1005 but that myself should be the root and father of many kings. if there come truth from them— as upon thee, macbeth, their speeches shine— why, by the verities on thee made good, may they not be my oracles as well, 1010 and set me up in hope? but hush! no more.   macbeth, as queen, lennox, ross, lords, ladies, and attendants] macbeth. here's our chief guest. lady macbeth. if he had been forgotten, 1015 it had been as a gap in our great feast, and all-thing unbecoming. macbeth. to-night we hold a solemn supper sir, and i'll request your presence. banquo. let your highness 1020 command upon me; to the which my duties are with a most indissoluble tie for ever knit. macbeth. ride you this afternoon? banquo. ay, my good lord. 1025macbeth. we should have else desired your good advice, which still hath been both grave and prosperous, in this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow. is't far you ride? banquo. as far, my lord, as will fill up the time 1030 'twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better, i must become a borrower of the night for a dark hour or twain. macbeth. fail not our feast. banquo. my lord, i will not. 1035macbeth. we hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd in england and in ireland, not confessing their cruel parricide, filling their hearers with strange invention: but of that to-morrow, when therewithal we shall have cause of state 1040 craving us jointly. hie you to horse: adieu, till you return at night. goes fleance with you? banquo. ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's. macbeth. i wish your horses swift and sure of foot; and so i do commend you to their backs. farewell. 1045   let every man be master of his time till seven at night: to make society the sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself till supper-time alone: while then, god be with you! 1050   sirrah, a word with you: attend those men our pleasure? attendant. they are, my lord, without the palace gate. macbeth. bring them before us. 1055   to be thus is nothing; but to be safely thus.—our fears in banquo stick deep; and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares; 1060 and, to that dauntless temper of his mind, he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour to act in safety. there is none but he whose being i do fear: and, under him, my genius is rebuked; as, it is said, 1065 mark antony's was by caesar. he chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me, and bade them speak to him: then prophet-like they hail'd him father to a line of kings: upon my head they placed a fruitless crown, 1070 and put a barren sceptre in my gripe, thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand, no son of mine succeeding. if 't be so, for banquo's issue have i filed my mind; for them the gracious duncan have i murder'd; 1075 put rancours in the vessel of my peace only for them; and mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man, to make them kings, the seed of banquo kings! rather than so, come fate into the list. 1080 and champion me to the utterance! who's there!   now go to the door, and stay there till we call.   was it not yesterday we spoke together? 1085first murderer. it was, so please your highness. macbeth. well then, now have you consider'd of my speeches? know that it was he in the times past which held you so under fortune, which you thought had been 1090 our innocent self: this i made good to you in our last conference, pass'd in probation with you, how you were borne in hand, how cross'd, the instruments, who wrought with them, and all things else that might 1095 to half a soul and to a notion crazed say 'thus did banquo.' first murderer. you made it known to us. macbeth. i did so, and went further, which is now our point of second meeting. do you find 1100 your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go? are you so gospell'd to pray for this good man and for his issue, whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave and beggar'd yours for ever? 1105first murderer. we are men, my liege. macbeth. ay, in the catalogue ye go for men; as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept all by the name of dogs: the valued file 1110 distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, the housekeeper, the hunter, every one according to the gift which bounteous nature hath in him closed; whereby he does receive particular addition. from the bill 1115 that writes them all alike: and so of men. now, if you have a station in the file, not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't; and i will put that business in your bosoms, whose execution takes your enemy off, 1120 grapples you to the heart and love of us, who wear our health but sickly in his life, which in his death were perfect. second murderer. i am one, my liege, whom the vile blows and buffets of the world 1125 have so incensed that i am reckless what i do to spite the world. first murderer. and i another so weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune, that i would set my lie on any chance, 1130 to mend it, or be rid on't. macbeth. both of you know banquo was your enemy. first murderer.   true, my lord. macbeth. so is he mine; and in such bloody distance, 1135 that every minute of his being thrusts against my near'st of life: and though i could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it, yet i must not, for certain friends that are both his and mine, 1140 whose loves i may not drop, but wail his fall who i myself struck down; and thence it is, that i to your assistance do make love, masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons. 1145second murderer. we shall, my lord, perform what you command us. first murderer. though our lives— macbeth. your spirits shine through you. within this hour at most i will advise you where to plant yourselves; 1150 acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time, the moment on't; for't must be done to-night, and something from the palace; always thought that i require a clearness: and with him— to leave no rubs nor botches in the work— 1155 fleance his son, that keeps him company, whose absence is no less material to me than is his father's, must embrace the fate of that dark hour. resolve yourselves apart: i'll come to you anon. 1160first murderer.   we are resolved, my lord. macbeth. i'll call upon you straight: abide within.   it is concluded. banquo, thy soul's flight, if it find heaven, must find it out to-night. 1165     previous scene         act iii, scene 2  the palace. next scene      lady macbeth. is banquo gone from court?

things without all remedy should be without regard: what's done is done. macbeth. we have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it: she'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice 1185 remains in danger of her former tooth. but let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams 1190 that shake us nightly: better be with the dead, whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy. duncan is in his grave; after life's fitful fever he sleeps well; 1195 treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison, malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing, can touch him further. lady macbeth. come on; gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks; 1200 be bright and jovial among your guests to-night. macbeth. so shall i, love; and so, i pray, be you: let your remembrance apply to banquo; present him eminence, both with eye and tongue: unsafe the while, that we 1205 must lave our honours in these flattering streams, and make our faces vizards to our hearts, disguising what they are. lady macbeth. you must leave this. macbeth. o, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! 1210 thou know'st that banquo, and his fleance, lives. lady macbeth. but in them nature's copy's not eterne. macbeth. there's comfort yet; they are assailable; then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown his cloister'd flight, ere to black hecate's summons 1215 the shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done a deed of dreadful note. lady macbeth. what's to be done? macbeth. be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, 1220 till thou applaud the deed. come, seeling night, scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day; and with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale! light thickens; and the crow 1225 makes wing to the rooky wood: good things of day begin to droop and drowse; while night's black agents to their preys do rouse. thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still; things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. 1230 so, prithee, go with me.      previous scene         act iii, scene 3  a park near the palace. next scene      first murderer. but who did bid thee join with us?

first murderer. ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides, with twenty trenched gashes on his head; the least a death to nature. macbeth. thanks for that: 1305 there the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled hath nature that in time will venom breed, no teeth for the present. get thee gone: to-morrow we'll hear, ourselves, again.    lady macbeth. my royal lord, you do not give the cheer: the feast is sold that is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making, 'tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home; from thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; 1315 meeting were bare without it. macbeth. sweet remembrancer! now, good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both! lennox. may't please your highness sit. 1320   macbeth's place] macbeth. here had we now our country's honour roof'd, were the graced person of our banquo present; who may i rather challenge for unkindness 1325 than pity for mischance! ross. his absence, sir, lays blame upon his promise. please't your highness to grace us with your royal company. macbeth. the table's full. 1330lennox. here is a place reserved, sir. macbeth. where? lennox. here, my good lord. what is't that moves your highness? macbeth. which of you have done this? lords. what, my good lord? 1335macbeth. thou canst not say i did it: never shake thy gory locks at me. ross. gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well. lady macbeth. sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus, and hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat; 1340 the fit is momentary; upon a thought he will again be well: if much you note him, you shall offend him and extend his passion: feed, and regard him not. are you a man? macbeth. ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that 1345 which might appal the devil. lady macbeth. o proper stuff! this is the very painting of your fear: this is the air-drawn dagger which, you said, led you to duncan. o, these flaws and starts, 1350 impostors to true fear, would well become a woman's story at a winter's fire, authorized by her grandam. shame itself! why do you make such faces? when all's done, you look but on a stool. 1355macbeth. prithee, see there! behold! look! lo! how say you? why, what care i? if thou canst nod, speak too. if charnel-houses and our graves must send those that we bury back, our monuments 1360 shall be the maws of kites.    lady macbeth. what, quite unmann'd in folly? macbeth. if i stand here, i saw him. lady macbeth. fie, for shame! 1365macbeth. blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time, ere human statute purged the gentle weal; ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd too terrible for the ear: the times have been, that, when the brains were out, the man would die, 1370 and there an end; but now they rise again, with twenty mortal murders on their crowns, and push us from our stools: this is more strange than such a murder is. lady macbeth. my worthy lord, 1375 your noble friends do lack you. macbeth. i do forget. do not muse at me, my most worthy friends, i have a strange infirmity, which is nothing to those that know me. come, love and health to all; 1380 then i'll sit down. give me some wine; fill full. i drink to the general joy o' the whole table, and to our dear friend banquo, whom we miss; would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst, and all to all. 1385lords. our duties, and the pledge.    macbeth. avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee! thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold; thou hast no speculation in those eyes 1390 which thou dost glare with! lady macbeth. think of this, good peers, but as a thing of custom: 'tis no other; only it spoils the pleasure of the time. macbeth. what man dare, i dare: 1395 approach thou like the rugged russian bear, the arm'd rhinoceros, or the hyrcan tiger; take any shape but that, and my firm nerves shall never tremble: or be alive again, and dare me to the desert with thy sword; 1400 if trembling i inhabit then, protest me the baby of a girl. hence, horrible shadow! unreal mockery, hence!   why, so: being gone, 1405 i am a man again. pray you, sit still. lady macbeth. you have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, with most admired disorder. macbeth. can such things be, and overcome us like a summer's cloud, 1410 without our special wonder? you make me strange even to the disposition that i owe, when now i think you can behold such sights, and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, when mine is blanched with fear. 1415ross. what sights, my lord? lady macbeth. i pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse; question enrages him. at once, good night: stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once. 1420lennox. good night; and better health attend his majesty! lady macbeth. a kind good night to all!    macbeth. it will have blood; they say, blood will have blood: 1425 stones have been known to move and trees to speak; augurs and understood relations have by magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth the secret'st man of blood. what is the night? lady macbeth. almost at odds with morning, which is which. 1430macbeth. how say'st thou, that macduff denies his person at our great bidding? lady macbeth. did you send to him, sir? macbeth. i hear it by the way; but i will send: there's not a one of them but in his house 1435 i keep a servant fee'd. i will to-morrow, and betimes i will, to the weird sisters: more shall they speak; for now i am bent to know, by the worst means, the worst. for mine own good, all causes shall give way: i am in blood 1440 stepp'd in so far that, should i wade no more, returning were as tedious as go o'er: strange things i have in head, that will to hand; which must be acted ere they may be scann'd. lady macbeth. you lack the season of all natures, sleep. 1445macbeth. come, we'll to sleep. my strange and self-abuse is the initiate fear that wants hard use: we are yet but young in deed.      previous scene         act iii, scene 5  a heath. next scene      first witch. why, how now, hecate! you look angerly. hecate. have i not reason, beldams as you are, saucy and overbold? how did you dare to trade and traffic with macbeth in riddles and affairs of death; 1455 and i, the mistress of your charms, the close contriver of all harms, was never call'd to bear my part, or show the glory of our art? and, which is worse, all you have done 1460 hath been but for a wayward son, spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do, loves for his own ends, not for you. but make amends now: get you gone, and at the pit of acheron 1465 meet me i' the morning: thither he will come to know his destiny: your vessels and your spells provide, your charms and every thing beside. i am for the air; this night i'll spend 1470 unto a dismal and a fatal end: great business must be wrought ere noon: upon the corner of the moon there hangs a vaporous drop profound; i'll catch it ere it come to ground: 1475 and that distill'd by magic sleights shall raise such artificial sprites as by the strength of their illusion shall draw him on to his confusion: he shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear 1480 he hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear: and you all know, security is mortals' chiefest enemy.   hark! i am call'd; my little spirit, see, 1485 sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.    first witch. come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.      previous scene         act iii, scene 6  forres. the palace. next scene      lennox. my former speeches have but hit your thoughts, which can interpret further: only, i say, things have been strangely borne. the gracious duncan was pitied of macbeth: marry, he was dead: 1495 and the right-valiant banquo walk'd too late; whom, you may say, if't please you, fleance kill'd, for fleance fled: men must not walk too late. who cannot want the thought how monstrous it was for malcolm and for donalbain 1500 to kill their gracious father? damned fact! how it did grieve macbeth! did he not straight in pious rage the two delinquents tear, that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep? was not that nobly done? ay, and wisely too; 1505 for 'twould have anger'd any heart alive to hear the men deny't. so that, i say, he has borne all things well: and i do think that had he duncan's sons under his key— as, an't please heaven, he shall not—they 1510 should find what 'twere to kill a father; so should fleance. but, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd his presence at the tyrant's feast, i hear macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell 1515 where he bestows himself? lord. the son of duncan, from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth lives in the english court, and is received of the most pious edward with such grace 1520 that the malevolence of fortune nothing takes from his high respect: thither macduff is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid to wake northumberland and warlike siward: that, by the help of these—with him above 1525 to ratify the work—we may again give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights, free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives, do faithful homage and receive free honours: all which we pine for now: and this report 1530 hath so exasperate the king that he prepares for some attempt of war. lennox. sent he to macduff? lord. he did: and with an absolute 'sir, not i,' the cloudy messenger turns me his back, 1535 and hums, as who should say 'you'll rue the time that clogs me with this answer.' lennox. and that well might advise him to a caution, to hold what distance his wisdom can provide. some holy angel 1540 fly to the court of england and unfold his message ere he come, that a swift blessing may soon return to this our suffering country under a hand accursed! lord. i'll send my prayers with him. 1545     previous scene         act iv, scene 1  a cavern. in the middle, a boiling cauldron. next scene      first witch. thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd. second witch. thrice and once the hedge-pig whined. third witch. harpier cries 'tis time, 'tis time. 1550first witch. round about the cauldron go; in the poison'd entrails throw. toad, that under cold stone days and nights has thirty-one swelter'd venom sleeping got, 1555 boil thou first i' the charmed pot. all. double, double toil and trouble; fire burn, and cauldron bubble. second witch. fillet of a fenny snake, in the cauldron boil and bake; 1560 eye of newt and toe of frog, wool of bat and tongue of dog, adder's fork and blind-worm's sting, lizard's leg and owlet's wing, for a charm of powerful trouble, 1565 like a hell-broth boil and bubble. all. double, double toil and trouble; fire burn and cauldron bubble. third witch. scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, witches' mummy, maw and gulf 1570 of the ravin'd salt-sea shark, root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark, liver of blaspheming jew, gall of goat, and slips of yew silver'd in the moon's eclipse, 1575 nose of turk and tartar's lips, finger of birth-strangled babe ditch-deliver'd by a drab, make the gruel thick and slab: add thereto a tiger's chaudron, 1580 for the ingredients of our cauldron. all. double, double toil and trouble; fire burn and cauldron bubble. second witch. cool it with a baboon's blood, then the charm is firm and good. 1585   hecate. o well done! i commend your pains; and every one shall share i' the gains; and now about the cauldron sing, live elves and fairies in a ring, 1590 enchanting all that you put in.       second witch. by the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. 1595 open, locks, whoever knocks!    macbeth. how now, you secret, black, and midnight hags! what is't you do?

a fourth! start, eyes! what, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom? another yet! a seventh! i'll see no more: 1690 and yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass which shows me many more; and some i see that two-fold balls and treble scepters carry: horrible sight! now, i see, 'tis true; for the blood-bolter'd banquo smiles upon me, 1695 and points at them for his.   what, is this so? first witch. ay, sir, all this is so: but why stands macbeth thus amazedly? 1700 come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites, and show the best of our delights: i'll charm the air to give a sound, while you perform your antic round: that this great king may kindly say, 1705 our duties did his welcome pay.    macbeth. where are they? gone? let this pernicious hour stand aye accursed in the calendar! come in, without there! 1710   lennox. what's your grace's will? macbeth. saw you the weird sisters? lennox. no, my lord. macbeth. came they not by you?

1735 come, bring me where they are.      previous scene         act iv, scene 2  fife. macduff’s castle. next scene      lady macduff. what had he done, to make him fly the land? ross. you must have patience, madam. 1740lady macduff. he had none: his flight was madness: when our actions do not, our fears do make us traitors. ross. you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear. 1745lady macduff. wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes, his mansion and his titles in a place from whence himself does fly? he loves us not; he wants the natural touch: for the poor wren, the most diminutive of birds, will fight, 1750 her young ones in her nest, against the owl. all is the fear and nothing is the love; as little is the wisdom, where the flight so runs against all reason. ross. my dearest coz, 1755 i pray you, school yourself: but for your husband, he is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows the fits o' the season. i dare not speak much further; but cruel are the times, when we are traitors 1760 and do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour from what we fear, yet know not what we fear, but float upon a wild and violent sea each way and move. i take my leave of you: shall not be long but i'll be here again: 1765 things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward to what they were before. my pretty cousin, blessing upon you! lady macduff. father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless. ross. i am so much a fool, should i stay longer, 1770 it would be my disgrace and your discomfort: i take my leave at once.    lady macduff. sirrah, your father's dead; and what will you do now? how will you live? 1775son. as birds do, mother. lady macduff. what, with worms and flies? son. with what i get, i mean; and so do they. lady macduff. poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime, the pitfall nor the gin. 1780son. why should i, mother? poor birds they are not set for. my father is not dead, for all your saying. lady macduff. yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father? son. nay, how will you do for a husband? lady macduff. why, i can buy me twenty at any market. 1785son. then you'll buy 'em to sell again. lady macduff. thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith, with wit enough for thee. son. was my father a traitor, mother? lady macduff. ay, that he was. 1790son. what is a traitor? lady macduff. why, one that swears and lies. son. and be all traitors that do so? lady macduff. every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged. son. and must they all be hanged that swear and lie? 1795lady macduff. every one. son. who must hang them? lady macduff. why, the honest men. son. then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and swearers enow to beat 1800 the honest men and hang up them. lady macduff. now, god help thee, poor monkey! but how wilt thou do for a father? son. if he were dead, you'ld weep for him: if you would not, it were a good sign 1805 that i should quickly have a new father. lady macduff. poor prattler, how thou talk'st!    messenger. bless you, fair dame! i am not to you known, though in your state of honour i am perfect. 1810 i doubt some danger does approach you nearly: if you will take a homely man's advice, be not found here; hence, with your little ones. to fright you thus, methinks, i am too savage; to do worse to you were fell cruelty, 1815 which is too nigh your person. heaven preserve you! i dare abide no longer.    lady macduff. whither should i fly? i have done no harm. but i remember now 1820 i am in this earthly world; where to do harm is often laudable, to do good sometime accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas, do i put up that womanly defence, to say i have done no harm? 1825   what are these faces? first murderer. where is your husband? lady macduff. i hope, in no place so unsanctified where such as thou mayst find him. 1830first murderer. he's a traitor. son. thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain! first murderer. what, you egg!   young fry of treachery! 1835son. he has kill'd me, mother: run away, i pray you!     murderers, following her] 1840   previous scene         act iv, scene 3  england. before the king’s palace. next scene      malcolm. let us seek out some desolate shade, and there weep our sad bosoms empty. macduff. let us rather hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men 1845 bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn new widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows strike heaven on the face, that it resounds as if it felt with scotland and yell'd out like syllable of dolour. 1850malcolm. what i believe i'll wail, what know believe, and what i can redress, as i shall find the time to friend, i will. what you have spoke, it may be so perchance. this tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, 1855 was once thought honest: you have loved him well. he hath not touch'd you yet. i am young; but something you may deserve of him through me, and wisdom to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb 1860 to appease an angry god. macduff. i am not treacherous. malcolm. but macbeth is. a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge. but i shall crave 1865 your pardon; that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose: angels are bright still, though the brightest fell; though all things foul would wear the brows of grace, yet grace must still look so. 1870macduff. i have lost my hopes. malcolm. perchance even there where i did find my doubts. why in that rawness left you wife and child, those precious motives, those strong knots of love, without leave-taking? i pray you, 1875 let not my jealousies be your dishonours, but mine own safeties. you may be rightly just, whatever i shall think. macduff. bleed, bleed, poor country! great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure, 1880 for goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou thy wrongs; the title is affeer'd! fare thee well, lord: i would not be the villain that thou think'st for the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp, 1885 and the rich east to boot. malcolm. be not offended: i speak not as in absolute fear of you. i think our country sinks beneath the yoke; it weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash 1890 is added to her wounds: i think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right; and here from gracious england have i offer of goodly thousands: but, for all this, when i shall tread upon the tyrant's head, 1895 or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country shall have more vices than it had before, more suffer and more sundry ways than ever, by him that shall succeed. macduff. what should he be? 1900malcolm. it is myself i mean: in whom i know all the particulars of vice so grafted that, when they shall be open'd, black macbeth will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state esteem him as a lamb, being compared 1905 with my confineless harms. macduff. not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd in evils to top macbeth. malcolm. i grant him bloody, 1910 luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin that has a name: but there's no bottom, none, in my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters, your matrons and your maids, could not fill up 1915 the cistern of my lust, and my desire all continent impediments would o'erbear that did oppose my will: better macbeth than such an one to reign. macduff. boundless intemperance 1920 in nature is a tyranny; it hath been the untimely emptying of the happy throne and fall of many kings. but fear not yet to take upon you what is yours: you may convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty, 1925 and yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink. we have willing dames enough: there cannot be that vulture in you, to devour so many as will to greatness dedicate themselves, finding it so inclined. 1930malcolm. with this there grows in my most ill-composed affection such a stanchless avarice that, were i king, i should cut off the nobles for their lands, desire his jewels and this other's house: 1935 and my more-having would be as a sauce to make me hunger more; that i should forge quarrels unjust against the good and loyal, destroying them for wealth. macduff. this avarice 1940 sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been the sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear; scotland hath foisons to fill up your will. of your mere own: all these are portable, 1945 with other graces weigh'd. malcolm. but i have none: the king-becoming graces, as justice, verity, temperance, stableness, bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, 1950 i have no relish of them, but abound in the division of each several crime, acting it many ways. nay, had i power, i should pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, uproar the universal peace, confound 1955 all unity on earth. macduff. o scotland, scotland! malcolm. if such a one be fit to govern, speak: i am as i have spoken. macduff. fit to govern! 1960 no, not to live. o nation miserable, with an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd, when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again, since that the truest issue of thy throne by his own interdiction stands accursed, 1965 and does blaspheme his breed? thy royal father was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee, oftener upon her knees than on her feet, died every day she lived. fare thee well! these evils thou repeat'st upon thyself 1970 have banish'd me from scotland. o my breast, thy hope ends here! malcolm. macduff, this noble passion, child of integrity, hath from my soul wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts 1975 to thy good truth and honour. devilish macbeth by many of these trains hath sought to win me into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me from over-credulous haste: but god above deal between thee and me! for even now 1980 i put myself to thy direction, and unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure the taints and blames i laid upon myself, for strangers to my nature. i am yet unknown to woman, never was forsworn, 1985 scarcely have coveted what was mine own, at no time broke my faith, would not betray the devil to his fellow and delight no less in truth than life: my first false speaking was this upon myself: what i am truly, 1990 is thine and my poor country's to command: whither indeed, before thy here-approach, old siward, with ten thousand warlike men, already at a point, was setting forth. now we'll together; and the chance of goodness 1995 be like our warranted quarrel! why are you silent? macduff. such welcome and unwelcome things at once 'tis hard to reconcile.    malcolm. well; more anon.—comes the king forth, i pray you? 2000doctor. ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls that stay his cure: their malady convinces the great assay of art; but at his touch— such sanctity hath heaven given his hand— they presently amend. 2005malcolm. i thank you, doctor.    macduff. what's the disease he means? malcolm. 'tis call'd the evil: a most miraculous work in this good king; 2010 which often, since my here-remain in england, i have seen him do. how he solicits heaven, himself best knows: but strangely-visited people, all swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye, the mere despair of surgery, he cures, 2015 hanging a golden stamp about their necks, put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken, to the succeeding royalty he leaves the healing benediction. with this strange virtue, he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy, 2020 and sundry blessings hang about his throne, that speak him full of grace.    macduff. see, who comes here? malcolm. my countryman; but yet i know him not. 2025macduff. my ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither. malcolm. i know him now. good god, betimes remove the means that makes us strangers! ross. sir, amen. macduff. stands scotland where it did? 2030ross. alas, poor country! almost afraid to know itself. it cannot be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing, but who knows nothing, is once seen to smile; where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air 2035 are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives expire before the flowers in their caps, dying or ere they sicken. 2040macduff. o, relation too nice, and yet too true! malcolm. what's the newest grief? ross. that of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker: each minute teems a new one. 2045macduff. how does my wife? ross. why, well. macduff. and all my children? ross. well too. macduff. the tyrant has not batter'd at their peace? 2050ross. no; they were well at peace when i did leave 'em. macduff. but not a niggard of your speech: how goes't? ross. when i came hither to transport the tidings, which i have heavily borne, there ran a rumour of many worthy fellows that were out; 2055 which was to my belief witness'd the rather, for that i saw the tyrant's power a-foot: now is the time of help; your eye in scotland would create soldiers, make our women fight, to doff their dire distresses. 2060malcolm. be't their comfort we are coming thither: gracious england hath lent us good siward and ten thousand men; an older and a better soldier none that christendom gives out. 2065ross. would i could answer this comfort with the like! but i have words that would be howl'd out in the desert air, where hearing should not latch them. macduff. what concern they? 2070 the general cause? or is it a fee-grief due to some single breast? ross. no mind that's honest but in it shares some woe; though the main part pertains to you alone. 2075macduff. if it be mine, keep it not from me, quickly let me have it. ross. let not your ears despise my tongue for ever, which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard. 2080macduff. hum! i guess at it. ross. your castle is surprised; your wife and babes savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner, were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer, to add the death of you. 2085malcolm. merciful heaven! what, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows; give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break. macduff. my children too? 2090ross. wife, children, servants, all that could be found. macduff. and i must be from thence! my wife kill'd too? ross. i have said. 2095malcolm. be comforted: let's make us medicines of our great revenge, to cure this deadly grief. macduff. he has no children. all my pretty ones? did you say all? o hell-kite! all? 2100 what, all my pretty chickens and their dam at one fell swoop? malcolm. dispute it like a man. macduff. i shall do so; but i must also feel it as a man: 2105 i cannot but remember such things were, that were most precious to me. did heaven look on, and would not take their part? sinful macduff, they were all struck for thee! naught that i am, not for their own demerits, but for mine, 2110 fell slaughter on their souls. heaven rest them now! malcolm. be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it. macduff. o, i could play the woman with mine eyes and braggart with my tongue! but, gentle heavens, 2115 cut short all intermission; front to front bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself; within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape, heaven forgive him too! malcolm. this tune goes manly. 2120 come, go we to the king; our power is ready; our lack is nothing but our leave; macbeth is ripe for shaking, and the powers above put on their instruments. receive what cheer you may: the night is long that never finds the day. 2125     previous scene         act v, scene 1  dunsinane. ante-room in the castle. next scene      doctor. i have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. when was it she last walked? gentlewoman. since his majesty went into the field, i have seen 2130 her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep. doctor. a great perturbation in nature, to receive at once 2135 the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching! in this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say? gentlewoman. that, sir, which i will not report after her. 2140doctor. you may to me: and 'tis most meet you should. gentlewoman. neither to you nor any one; having no witness to confirm my speech.   lo you, here she comes! this is her very guise; 2145 and, upon my life, fast asleep. observe her; stand close. doctor. how came she by that light? gentlewoman. why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; 'tis her command. doctor. you see, her eyes are open. 2150gentlewoman. ay, but their sense is shut. doctor. what is it she does now? look, how she rubs her hands. gentlewoman. it is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands: i have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour. 2155lady macbeth. yet here's a spot. doctor. hark! she speaks: i will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly. lady macbeth. out, damned spot! out, i say!—one: two: why, then, 'tis time to do't.—hell is murky!—fie, my 2160 lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? what need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?—yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him. doctor. do you mark that? 2165lady macbeth. the thane of fife had a wife: where is she now?— what, will these hands ne'er be clean?—no more o' that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with this starting. doctor. go to, go to; you have known what you should not. 2170gentlewoman. she has spoke what she should not, i am sure of that: heaven knows what she has known. lady macbeth. here's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little hand. oh, oh, oh! 2175doctor. what a sigh is there! the heart is sorely charged. gentlewoman. i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body. doctor. well, well, well,— gentlewoman. pray god it be, sir. 2180doctor. this disease is beyond my practise: yet i have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds. lady macbeth. wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale.—i tell you yet again, banquo's buried; he 2185 cannot come out on's grave. doctor. even so? lady macbeth. to bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate: come, come, come, come, give me your hand. what's done cannot be undone.—to bed, to bed, to bed! 2190   doctor. will she go now to bed? gentlewoman. directly. doctor. foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds 2195 to their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets: more needs she the divine than the physician. god, god forgive us all! look after her; remove from her the means of all annoyance, and still keep eyes upon her. so, good night: 2200 my mind she has mated, and amazed my sight. i think, but dare not speak. gentlewoman. good night, good doctor.      previous scene         act v, scene 2  the country near dunsinane. next scene      lennox, and soldiers]  menteith. the english power is near, led on by malcolm, his uncle siward and the good macduff: revenges burn in them; for their dear causes would to the bleeding and the grim alarm 2210 excite the mortified man. angus. near birnam wood shall we well meet them; that way are they coming. caithness. who knows if donalbain be with his brother? lennox. for certain, sir, he is not: i have a file 2215 of all the gentry: there is siward's son, and many unrough youths that even now protest their first of manhood. menteith. what does the tyrant? caithness. great dunsinane he strongly fortifies: 2220 some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him do call it valiant fury: but, for certain, he cannot buckle his distemper'd cause within the belt of rule. angus. now does he feel 2225 his secret murders sticking on his hands; now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach; those he commands move only in command, nothing in love: now does he feel his title hang loose about him, like a giant's robe 2230 upon a dwarfish thief. menteith. who then shall blame his pester'd senses to recoil and start, when all that is within him does condemn itself for being there? 2235caithness. well, march we on, to give obedience where 'tis truly owed: meet we the medicine of the sickly weal, and with him pour we in our country's purge each drop of us. 2240lennox. or so much as it needs, to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds. make we our march towards birnam.      previous scene         act v, scene 3  dunsinane. a room in the castle. next scene      macbeth. bring me no more reports; let them fly all: till birnam wood remove to dunsinane, i cannot taint with fear. what's the boy malcolm? was he not born of woman? the spirits that know all mortal consequences have pronounced me thus: 2250 'fear not, macbeth; no man that's born of woman shall e'er have power upon thee.' then fly, false thanes, and mingle with the english epicures: the mind i sway by and the heart i bear 2255 shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.   the devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon! where got'st thou that goose look? servant. there is ten thousand— 2260macbeth. geese, villain! servant. soldiers, sir. macbeth. go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear, thou lily-liver'd boy. what soldiers, patch? death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine 2265 are counsellors to fear. what soldiers, whey-face? servant. the english force, so please you. macbeth. take thy face hence.   seyton!—i am sick at heart, 2270 when i behold—seyton, i say!—this push will cheer me ever, or disseat me now. i have lived long enough: my way of life is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf; and that which should accompany old age, 2275 as honour, love, obedience, troops of friends, i must not look to have; but, in their stead, curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath, which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. seyton!    seyton. what is your gracious pleasure? macbeth. what news more? seyton. all is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported. macbeth. i'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd. give me my armour. 2285seyton. 'tis not needed yet. macbeth. i'll put it on. send out more horses; skirr the country round; hang those that talk of fear. give me mine armour. how does your patient, doctor? 2290doctor. not so sick, my lord, as she is troubled with thick coming fancies, that keep her from her rest. macbeth. cure her of that. canst thou not minister to a mind diseased, 2295 pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow, raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart? 2300doctor. therein the patient must minister to himself. macbeth. throw physic to the dogs; i'll none of it. come, put mine armour on; give me my staff. seyton, send out. doctor, the thanes fly from me. 2305 come, sir, dispatch. if thou couldst, doctor, cast the water of my land, find her disease, and purge it to a sound and pristine health, i would applaud thee to the very echo, that should applaud again.—pull't off, i say.— 2310 what rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug, would scour these english hence? hear'st thou of them? doctor. ay, my good lord; your royal preparation makes us hear something. macbeth. bring it after me. 2315 i will not be afraid of death and bane, till birnam forest come to dunsinane. doctor.   were i from dunsinane away and clear, profit again should hardly draw me here.      previous scene         act v, scene 4  country near birnam wood. next scene      siward, macduff, menteith, caithness, angus,  lennox, ross, and soldiers, marching]  malcolm. cousins, i hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe. 2325menteith. we doubt it nothing. siward. what wood is this before us? menteith. the wood of birnam. malcolm. let every soldier hew him down a bough and bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow 2330 the numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us. soldiers. it shall be done. siward. we learn no other but the confident tyrant keeps still in dunsinane, and will endure 2335 our setting down before 't. malcolm. 'tis his main hope: for where there is advantage to be given, both more and less have given him the revolt, and none serve with him but constrained things 2340 whose hearts are absent too. macduff. let our just censures attend the true event, and put we on industrious soldiership. siward. the time approaches 2345 that will with due decision make us know what we shall say we have and what we owe. thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate, but certain issue strokes must arbitrate: towards which advance the war. 2350     previous scene         act v, scene 5  dunsinane. within the castle. next scene      macbeth. hang out our banners on the outward walls; the cry is still 'they come:' our castle's strength will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie 2355 till famine and the ague eat them up: were they not forced with those that should be ours, we might have met them dareful, beard to beard, and beat them backward home.   2360 what is that noise? seyton. it is the cry of women, my good lord.    macbeth. i have almost forgot the taste of fears; the time has been, my senses would have cool'd 2365 to hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in't: i have supp'd full with horrors; direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts cannot once start me. 2370   wherefore was that cry? seyton. the queen, my lord, is dead. macbeth. she should have died hereafter; there would have been a time for such a word. 2375 to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time, and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. out, out, brief candle! 2380 life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. 2385   thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly. messenger. gracious my lord, i should report that which i say i saw, but know not how to do it. 2390macbeth. well, say, sir. messenger. as i did stand my watch upon the hill, i look'd toward birnam, and anon, methought, the wood began to move. macbeth. liar and slave! 2395messenger. let me endure your wrath, if't be not so: within this three mile may you see it coming; i say, a moving grove. macbeth. if thou speak'st false, upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive, 2400 till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth, i care not if thou dost for me as much. i pull in resolution, and begin to doubt the equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth: 'fear not, till birnam wood 2405 do come to dunsinane:' and now a wood comes toward dunsinane. arm, arm, and out! if this which he avouches does appear, there is nor flying hence nor tarrying here. i gin to be aweary of the sun, 2410 and wish the estate o' the world were now undone. ring the alarum-bell! blow, wind! come, wrack! at least we'll die with harness on our back.      previous scene         act v, scene 6  dunsinane. before the castle. next scene      and their army, with boughs]  malcolm. now near enough: your leafy screens throw down. and show like those you are. you, worthy uncle, shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son, lead our first battle: worthy macduff and we 2420 shall take upon 's what else remains to do, according to our order. siward. fare you well. do we but find the tyrant's power to-night, let us be beaten, if we cannot fight. 2425macduff. make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath, those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.      previous scene         act v, scene 7  another part of the field. next scene      macbeth. they have tied me to a stake; i cannot fly, 2430 but, bear-like, i must fight the course. what's he that was not born of woman? such a one am i to fear, or none.    young siward. what is thy name? 2435macbeth. thou'lt be afraid to hear it. young siward. no; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name than any is in hell. macbeth. my name's macbeth. young siward. the devil himself could not pronounce a title 2440 more hateful to mine ear. macbeth. no, nor more fearful. young siward. thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword i'll prove the lie thou speak'st.    macbeth. thou wast born of woman but swords i smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.       macduff. that way the noise is. tyrant, show thy face! if thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine, my wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still. i cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms are hired to bear their staves: either thou, macbeth, 2455 or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge i sheathe again undeeded. there thou shouldst be; by this great clatter, one of greatest note seems bruited. let me find him, fortune! and more i beg not. 2460      siward. this way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd: the tyrant's people on both sides do fight; the noble thanes do bravely in the war; 2465 the day almost itself professes yours, and little is to do. malcolm. we have met with foes that strike beside us. siward. enter, sir, the castle. 2470     previous scene         act v, scene 8  another part of the field.       macbeth. why should i play the roman fool, and die on mine own sword? whiles i see lives, the gashes do better upon them. 2475   macduff. turn, hell-hound, turn! macbeth. of all men else i have avoided thee: but get thee back; my soul is too much charged with blood of thine already. 2480macduff. i have no words: my voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out!    macbeth. thou losest labour: 2485 as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed: let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests; i bear a charmed life, which must not yield, to one of woman born. 2490macduff. despair thy charm; and let the angel whom thou still hast served tell thee, macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd. macbeth. accursed be that tongue that tells me so, 2495 for it hath cow'd my better part of man! and be these juggling fiends no more believed, that palter with us in a double sense; that keep the word of promise to our ear, and break it to our hope. i'll not fight with thee. 2500macduff. then yield thee, coward, and live to be the show and gaze o' the time: we'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, painted on a pole, and underwrit, 'here may you see the tyrant.' 2505macbeth. i will not yield, to kiss the ground before young malcolm's feet, and to be baited with the rabble's curse. though birnam wood be come to dunsinane, and thou opposed, being of no woman born, 2510 yet i will try the last. before my body i throw my warlike shield. lay on, macduff, and damn'd be him that first cries, 'hold, enough!'     2515 malcolm, siward, ross, the other thanes, and soldiers] malcolm. i would the friends we miss were safe arrived. siward. some must go off: and yet, by these i see, so great a day as this is cheaply bought. malcolm. macduff is missing, and your noble son. 2520ross. your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt: he only lived but till he was a man; the which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd in the unshrinking station where he fought, but like a man he died. 2525siward. then he is dead? ross. ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth, for then it hath no end. siward. had he his hurts before? 2530ross. ay, on the front. siward. why then, god's soldier be he! had i as many sons as i have hairs, i would not wish them to a fairer death: and so, his knell is knoll'd. 2535malcolm. he's worth more sorrow, and that i'll spend for him. siward. he's worth no more they say he parted well, and paid his score: and so, god be with him! here comes newer comfort. 2540   macduff. hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands the usurper's cursed head: the time is free: i see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl, that speak my salutation in their minds; 2545 whose voices i desire aloud with mine: hail, king of scotland! all. hail, king of scotland!    malcolm. we shall not spend a large expense of time 2550 before we reckon with your several loves, and make us even with you. my thanes and kinsmen, henceforth be earls, the first that ever scotland in such an honour named. what's more to do, which would be planted newly with the time, 2555 as calling home our exiled friends abroad that fled the snares of watchful tyranny; producing forth the cruel ministers of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen, who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands 2560 took off her life; this, and what needful else that calls upon us, by the grace of grace, we will perform in measure, time and place: so, thanks to all at once and to each one, whom we invite to see us crown'd at scone. 2565  "

"“these are the breaks” -- the history of the breakbeat lyricsthe music you hear as a kid is what shapes you.  whether your earliest musical memories are of the beatles professing that they love you yeah yeah yeah, your grammar school classmates singing along with thriller, or jay z rapping about his hard knock life, the tunes you hear in your formative years pave the way for what’s to come.  so it is with hip-hop.  the musical backbone of rap’s most influential era -- the so-called golden age of the late 1980s to early 90s -- has its roots in the childhood memories of its creators.  songs heard in parents’ dens or at dances got chopped up, dissected, and scientifically rearranged.  a few seconds of solo drums in the middle of a song would become the basis for a whole new creation.  a guitar stab, grunt, or horn riff took on new life as the canvas for an emcee or group to paint on.  and anything was fair game.  cheesy pop songs, novelties, movie soundtracks -- as long as it was funky, it made the cut.  it was all about the breaks.  at the very beginning of hip-hop culture, there was the break.  a dj named clyde campbell working parties in the bronx in the early 1970s discovered that people loved the moments in songs where everything would drop out except the drums, or occasionally the drums and bass.  but these instrumental sections were almost always short -- a few seconds or a minute.  how to keep the party going?  campbell, who was dj’ing under the name “kool herc,” invented a technique he called “the merry-go-round.”  it involved finding those key moments in each record, and going right from one to the other.  he’d start with james brown’s “give it up or turn it loose,” a favorite among b-boys to this day (it’s the one old-schoolers call “clap your hands, stomp your feet,” after brown’s exhortation at the beginning of the break).  then he’d transition into “bongo rock” from the incredible bongo band, and go right into babe ruth’s “the mexican.”  or, even better, he’d take two copies of the same record and switch back and forth, extending a single break into infinity.  the dancers loved it -- all of their favorite moments that they’d previously had to wait for, now happening one after another, in an endless wave of funky drums.  by the time rap music made it to record in 1979, the concept of extending a single breakbeat was transferred onto the new genre.  the early records featured popular songs of the era either sampled or replayed, with grooves that had once rocked the dance floor now expected to rock the pockets of record buyers. familiarity may breed contempt, but to early hip hop record makers, it also bred success.  chic’s monster hit “good times,” released that very year, formed the basis for dozens of early rap songs, including the biggest one of all, “rapper’s delight” by the sugarhill gang. cheryl lynn’s “got to be real” from the previous year was another one whose groove was used over and over.  but the breaks used at the earliest parties showed up as well.  as the genre grew and more records started being made, the tunes that folks remembered from the parties they had attended as kids ten or so years prior began showing up in their raps.  by the mid-1980s, records like the incredible bongo band’s “apache,” the honeydrippers’ “impeach the president,” or any number of james brown cuts began appearing in earnest as the backing to rap records.  and then 1986 hit, and nothing was the same.  two enigmatic figures known as “breakbeat lou” and “breakbeat lenny” put out the first volume of an anthology that would shake up the world and change the sound of rap forever.  louie flores and lenny roberts released the first of what would become 25 volumes of a series called ultimate breaks and beats.  these were wide-ranging, extremely illegal compilations that included songs favored by djs for their breaks.  the first volume contained tunes ranging from the monkees’ “mary mary” to rufus thomas’ novelty “do the funky penguin.”  but it was the third song, “amen brother” by the winstons, that would push the project over the edge.  the drum solo in that tune became so popular that it eventually got its own name -- the “‘amen’ break.”  it showed up in nwa (“straight outta compton”), salt-n-pepa (“i desire”), the ultramagnetic mcs (“critical beatdown”), and countless other dope late-80s tracks.  it also took on a second life in the 90s, as it appeared in sped-up form in nearly every drum-n-bass song of the era.  more than any individual tune, though, it was the idea of having all of the hottest breaks in one easy-to-find place that made the series take off.  until the series stopped in 1991, the tunes on ubb became the backbone of the genre.  the songs on the 25 volumes ranged from 1966 to 1984, with the vast majority unsurprisingly dating from the 70s, the same era as the parties where breakbeats first ruled.  every producer of the era, whether they copped to it or not, used breaks found somewhere on the compilations.  they defined the sound of the era.  the series ceased right around the time sampling laws tightened up, and using breaks became considerably more expensive.  the classic breaks are now far too identifiable, so current producers engage in a cat-and-mouse game of finding more and more obscure breaks, or trying to alter them enough to be unrecognizable.  luckily for the inquisitive listener of today, ubb was reissued (still illegally!) a few years ago as a set of 2 cds containing all 25 volumes on mp3, so it’s possible to find if you look hard enough.  what makes a break? “i’m ripping emcees from ‘funky drummer’ to ‘big beat’” -- ll cool j, “murdergram”  so why have some breaks been used over and over?  what makes a good break beat?  first off, from a producer’s perspective, ease of use is important.  having only the drums playing makes a breakbeat easy to sample and loop -- there are no difficult decisions on how to cut out the vocals or other instruments.  it is this simple qualification that many of rap’s most sampled breaks have in common.  in 2010, the website who sampled put together a list of the most-sampled breaks of all time.  the vast majority of them -- eight out of ten -- were from between 1969 and 1973, with just one outlier on each end of that time period.  in almost all of them, there were between two and eight bars of solo drums.  what does that mean to you as a listener?  first off, certain popular breaks have become a part of the language and meaning of rap songs.  when a contemporary song uses “apache” from the incredible bongo band (from 1973, #6 on the list), it’s used not only because it’s a dope break.  the sample’s existence is itself a reference to its popularity in early park jams, and also to the hundreds of times the beat has been sampled since 1981.  jay z and kanye west used these associations astutely on the 2011 track “that’s my bitch.”  the song foregrounded an “apache” sample, but also included an homage to public enemy and a lyrical shoutout to golden age rapper monie love.  all of these things worked in tandem to add an intended subtext of, as digital underground put it, “a tribute to the early days.”  in fact, as early as 1987, “apache” was used to signify those same early days.  a sample of the song was used on kool moe dee’s “way way back,” on which he used a self-consciously dated style to pay tribute to his roots.  likewise, busy bee used the “apache” break on his 1988 song “old school.”  immediately after the break plays, his first words are, “oh man, that’s that old school.”  without the knowledge of the break’s history, that ad-lib would fall on deaf ears, and in fact the whole concept of the song would be nonsensical. that same sample could also serve as a canvas for innovation.  kool g. rap used it for his 1989 tune “men at work,”  whose polysyllabic rhymes left a lifelong impression on a whole generation of emcees (to this day, black thought of the roots can still rap the tune perfectly word-for-word).  the tune had all the more impact for including advanced lyricism against a familiar template, where listeners were used to hearing the simplistic end-line rhymes of the sugarhill gang or the schoolyard chants of busy bee.  in truth, a solid knowledge of the soul and funk of the late 1960s and 1970s is essential to really understanding hip-hop.  being able to identify the bells on bob james’ classic “take me to the mardi gras” (1974) or the drums of kool & the gang’s “chocolate buttermilk” (1969) will add layers upon layers to your enjoyment of rap songs.  can’t stop the rock: rock & roll and other outliers “i’m the king of rock, there is none higher/sucker emcees should call me ‘sire’” -- run-dmc, “king of rock”  one of the oddities on who sampled’s list provides another important clue to unlocking the mysteries of the break beat.  number nine on the list is “the big beat,” a 1980 track by hard rocker billy squier.  the song didn’t chart, and would have been forgotten, despite its charming stop-motion-filled video , if not for rap.  its opening drum break was immediately adopted by rappers -- by 1981, it was already a staple of many artists’ live performances.  so what does this mean?  that rappers were anxiously awaiting billy squier’s first solo album?  of course not.  the break was adopted because it had open drums, was right at the beginning of the song, and sounded great.  that it was on a hard-rock record mattered not a bit.  this catholic approach to sampling has been true of hip-hop from the beginning, and continues to be so today.  popular golden age breaks came from funk and soul records, to be sure.  but they also came from jazz, hard rock, and even the monkees, the only-on-television 1960s “band” whose “mary mary” was adopted by de la soul, run-dmc, j.j. fad, and 2 live crew proteges anquette.  if something sounded good, the source didn’t matter.  this approach, of reshaping good bits no matter where they’re from, goes back very far in hip-hop’s dna.  afrika bambaataa, one of the genre’s foremost pioneers, was famous for it.  during hip-hop’s early years, he would throw parties where he would play everything -- electronic music, video game soundtracks, calypso -- with an unerring ear for what would both surprise people and keep the party moving.  his record collection, which is now preserved at cornell university, grew to over 40,000 strong, and he became known as the “master of records.”  that same adventurousness is preserved even in today’s big stars -- jay z’s sample of gonjasufi, kanye west taking from 1970s hungarian rockers omega, and more.  the godfather: james brown and the break beat “tell the truth, james brown was old/’til eric and ra came out with ‘i got soul’” -- stetsasonic, ‘talkin all that jazz’  no discussion of break beats is complete without an examination of james brown.  tracks that he either performed on or produced have been sampled well over 5,000 times, making him by far the most-sampled artist of all time.  why is that?  as with so many things in hip-hop, and in history generally, there is no one monolithic answer.  brown’s cultural impact was unparalleled during the 1960s and 70s -- remember that showing a concert of his on television in the wake of mlk’s death was pretty much the only thing that kept the city of boston from rioting.  his call to “say it loud, i’m black and i’m proud” and his self-reliant cry that “i don’t want nobody to get me nothing/open up the door, i’ll get it myself” had a huge impact on black people (and also cost him a lot of his white audience). musically, brown more or less single-handedly invented the hard-edged funk that would come to dominate the 1970s.  he took the traditions of rhythm and blues music and stripped them down to almost nothing -- a few words (often made up on the spot), a groove, and often just a single chord.  somehow, the force of his personality -- and an unerring nose for finding great musicians -- made it all work, and songs like “super bad” and “get up (i feel like being a) sex machine” created what we now think of as funk.  james’ influence extended far beyond his own tunes.  the songs he co-wrote and produced for other members of his camp became classics as well.  lyn collins (“think (about it)”) and bobby byrd (“i know you got soul”) used brown’s band the j.b.’s to produce great records in the vein of the master.  and the j.b.’s themselves released a ton of instrumentals in the 1970s that stand alongside brown’s greatest work.  even former members of brown’s band got in on the act.  the sibling team of william “bootsy” collins on bass and phelps “catfish” collins on guitar, who played with brown briefly in 1970-1, became key members of the legendary parliament-funkadelic collective after leaving the group.  what does this all have to do with breaks?  first off, james’ early funk songs were repetitive grooves.  while played straight through by the musicians, their circular nature connects them to the four- and eight-bar loops of early rap.  also, the extended length of many of the tunes meant that there were lots of moments without vocals for burgeoning producers to sample.  and then there were the drum breaks.  “funky drummer,” number two on who sampled’s list, is a prime example.  the song itself is a seven-minute mellow bit of funk that consists almost entirely of a one-bar vamp.  brown emotes and plays some organ on top of the groove.  then, almost five minutes in, brown starts giving the band instructions for an upcoming drum break.   “you don’t have to do no soloing, brother.  just keep what you got!” he tells drummer clyde stubblefield.  and 45 seconds later, stubblefield does just that.  everyone drops out, and perhaps the most famous eight bars in the history of funk begins.  the beat -- a barrage of ghost notes, hi-hat openings and closings, and a tricky syncopated kick drum pattern -- would echo down through the decades.  starting in the mid-1980s, the beat became a staple in hip-hop.  other brown songs would soon follow, creating renewed interest in the master’s work.  while all eras of his career would be fair game for samplers, his “hard funk” period that began with 1967’s “cold sweat” and continued through 1976 makes up the vast majority of the sampled tunes.  the funk and soul of the late 1960s and 1970s, brown especially, is the dna of hip-hop.  it worked its way into the genre’s sound, its emcees rhythms, and even its lyrical preoccupations.  from biggie’s “funk flow to make your drawers drop slow” to “redman on the funk train,” the sound, feel, attitude, and cool of the funk pioneers has been a guiding light in the rap world.  in addition to brown, his proteges in the parliament-funkadelic collective had a huge influence on the sound of west coast rap in particular.  dr. dre’s breakthrough 1992 solo album the chronic, a record that came to define the so-called “g-funk” sound, featured ten different samples from either parliament, funkadelic, or the collective’s leader george clinton, where no other artist was sampled more than once.  kool & the gang, before having smash success with crossover hits like “hollywood swingin’,” released funky instrumental tracks that would later be raided by producers.  their 1969 debut record would be used by pioneers like eric b and rakim, stetsasonic, x-clan, nwa, special ed, a tribe called quest, and more.  while breakbeats were originally used to keep the party going, they came to be much more than that.  they were a way for producers to use the music that was most familiar to them in order to create something exciting and new.  and later, they began to signify themselves -- that is, to represent all of the other times that particular break has been used.  that, ultimately, is the magic of breaks, and their ever-shifting meaning over time is as hip-hop as anything else about them.

"  (8999746)  [“to pimp a butterfly, another classic cd/ghetto lullaby for every one-day emcee” kendrick lamar, “alright (video version)”](8999746)   (9020259). that  (8989543) is perhaps the signal excess of an overheated culture of instant commentary. one can imagine it weaving its way through the anonymous byways of social media in a scramble for distinction among a vast sea of potential tastemakers. in such a world, exaggeration and  (8989615) seep so readily into our language of criticism, that we forget just how unsettled such a pronouncement should make us. the juxtaposition is jarring; its two terms sit uncomfortably next to one another, upending the normal relations of time, art, and judgment.  the label is a daunting standard, and thus we should not be surprised that in hip-hop, it is rarely ventured. on occasion, however, the genuine article does emerge.  (8857512) 1994 debut album,  (8857507), is perhaps the category’s reigning exemplar, but one could just as easily make the case for  (8857513)  (8857516),  (8857520)  (8857526),  (8857528)  (8857531), or, today, kendrick lamar’s  (8989238).  “i heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time/bout who’s the best mc? kendrick, jigga and nas/eminem, andre 3000, the rest of ya’ll/new niggas just new niggas, don’t get involved” kendrick lamar, “control”  lamar was born kendrick lamar duckworth, just a few months before the release of  (8857730) would transform  (8941301) into a globally recognized symbol of america’s urban crisis. that year,  (8865707). by 1991, compton had a per capita murder rate more than three times that of the city of los angeles proper.  (8941347), who has written movingly of the homicide epidemic in southside los angeles, reminds us, the trauma of this carnage reverberates through entire communities:  (8857752)  indeed, the california state legislature officially declared  (8857799) in response, the legislature passed the  (8941373), making it a crime to “actively participate” in a street gang, and added severe penalties for “gang-related” crimes. given enormous latitude to suppress gang violence, the los angeles police department implemented  (8857889) a series of massive, counterinsurgency style  (8983766) police raids that same year. in the initial weekend of sweeps, over one thousand officers concentrated in south central los angeles arrested more than 1,400 people. when the dust settled, roughly 1,350 of those arrested were released without charges, and crime continued largely unabated as the city’s  (9025483) grew further entrenched.  like many overburdened, but loving parents, lamar’s mother and father tried mightily to help their son navigate this world of pervasive danger and limited opportunity. their efforts, which frame the profound coming-of-age and conversion narrative masterpiece (8863405), aimed at protecting lamar from the surface allure and subterranean horror of the street. in that album, a series of temptations –  (8864924),  (8865164),  (8864913),  (8864909) – all lead kendrick’s  (9000889) narrator to  (9000899) whose  (8863410) and  (8863457)-applied sheen has lost its luster. it is the increasingly frantic appeal by his parents – to love, experience, family loyalty, and subtly, the ethics and humility of christianity – that pull kendrick’s eponymous narrator  (9000914).  to pimp a butterfly is lamar’s third album, following good kid, m.a.a.d. city and his uneven independent debut,  (8863465). it has been met with near universal critical acclaim, garnering nine grammy nominations over two ceremonies, winning  (8959375) and “best rap/sung collaboration” ( (8857394)), while earning both “best rap performance” and “best rap song” twice ( (8863546) and  (8863558)).  lamar’s hometown  (8959540) described it as  (8863631)  (8959507) named it album of the year, calling the record  (8863653) the independent music hub,  (8959555), went even further, describing to pimp a butterfly as  (8863699)  (8959569), with an unapologetic gesture to the record’s novelistic ambition, declared it, simply,  (8863773)  the listener would do well to dwell upon the references that accompany these accolades. these gestures –to the album’s  (9000987), to lamar’s compton, california upbringing, and to its epic and literary aspirations– are indispensable clues to untangling the record’s sprawling tapestry of intertextual reference, cultural signification, and painstaking reflection.   (9020584)  released in march 2015, to pimp a butterfly came toward the end of an all-too-brief lull in between two successive, and highly politicized waves of police and vigilante slayings of unarmed african americans across the country, from  (9020588) to  (8959661), from  (8959690) to  (8959738). these ignoble surges of tragically dispatched life crested most spectacularly with the deaths of  (8863847) in ferguson, missouri and  (8863851) in baltimore, maryland – moments notoriously linked by the surge of protest and riot that followed in their wake. as the desiccated protest traditions of black politics surged back to life under the sign of  (8863861) lamar met the moment with an album whose  (8863868)  it is, without doubt, a demanding album – aesthetically, ethically, and politically. its sonic capaciousness ranges widely across jazz, hip-hop, soul, and funk. its  (9014184) requires unique patience and careful listening. this is, however, a work of art that repays this commitment in spades. to pimp a butterfly is an ambitious and extraordinary epic of  (8865078) and  (8865116)  (8983809) committed to the relentless, courageous exploration of its core philosophical problem. layered over a luscious soundscape drawn from fifty years of  (8931698) black music, the album is an intimate and introspective interrogation of the possibility of transcending the crises of faith, value, and identity that ominously cloud the horizons of black striving in a world as indelibly shaped by  (8947537) and  (8863921), as it is by  (8983838) and  (8863905). in contrast to good kid, m.a.a.d. city, which punctures 90’s gangsta rap’s claims to authority with more realism, to pimp a butterfly stages these questions around a series of marvelous and uncanny events. the record unfolds alongside lamar’s conversations and quarrels with fantastical beings, living metaphors, and ghosts – which cumulatively serve to dramatically and unsettlingly pose the gravity of ethical and existential problems at hand.  the album opener,  (8851505) begins with a misty sample of  (8959973)  (8851511) a slyly ironic gesture toward precisely the tension between the symbolic currency of blackness as a signifier of political subversion and moral redemption, and its material allure for the entertainment industry.  (8898440), channeling the spirit of funk maestro, california hip-hop ur-text, and  (8898537) founder  (8898545) (who also appears on “wesley’s theory”) introduces the album’s extended metaphor, the “butterfly” – that rare, beautiful talent –besieged on all sides by the rapacious forces of exploitation, evil, and anxiety.  we also meet here, for the first time, “ (8865357).” the resonance with american national identity remains implicit, but lamar’s uncle sam is a trickster figure whose interest in “butterflies” comes principally from their profit potential. “i can see the borrow in you, i can see the dollar in you,” sam proclaims to the newly minted rap star. kendrick’s narrator, with limited education and judgment, is susceptible to the extravagant promises proposed by sam in part because poverty and racial invisibility have nurtured strong affective desires for conspicuous wealth and fame.  this is compounded by a fragile sense of masculinity, which a siren-esque chorus of uncle sam’s “nieces” on  (8851514) the interlude which follows  (8983865) exploits with sinister intent. berating kendrick for falling short of “a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga” standard, he responds to the sirens in a spoken-word style delivery over a  (8865392)’s freewheeling piano, and  (8870287) jazzy composition, invoking a fairer accounting of america’s enduring debt to its black citizens – “i need  (9020759)/not a forty ounce and a pit bull.” the appeal to reparations here, however, is just the prelude to financial negotiation: “this dick ain’t free/matter fact it need interest, matter fact it’s nine inches/matter fact see our friendship based on business…oh america, you bad bitch/i picked cotton that made you rich/now my dick ain’t free.” but while jay-z stopped here, demanding that the industry “pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoe’d us/we can talk, but money talk, so talk mo’ bucks” ( (8870302) 2001), kendrick layers an crucial irony within the word “free.” lamar’s suspicion, further fleshed out over the course of the album, is that trying to discover value, or repair injustice through money alone is an illusory quest, conducted on terms so dominated by established wealth that the idea of “freedom” here rings empty and hollow. further meditating on this notion of “freedom,” lamar’s  (8851517) references  (8960139), the famous protagonist of  (8960144) epic and miniseries,  (8999511). in haley’s story, kinte heroically resists enslavement, refusing to give up his indigenous african name, taking flight from the plantation multiple times until finally being subjected to the amputation of his right foot.  (8947628)  the next suite of tracks,  (8851523)  (8851525) and  (8851528) undertake a descent into the psychic barriers that trouble a more triumphant, heroic fantasy of transcendence or flight.  (8999518) posits that the “institutional” racism of the post-industrial ghetto does not just constrain economic or social opportunity, but also imagination. the song captures both sides of a tense confrontation between the newly successful kendrick and a neighborhood friend who accompanies him to the  (8960191). while kendrick yearns to maintain his relationships and affiliations in compton, his friend – surrounded by the extravagance and absurdity of entertainment wealth – cannot shake the desire to prey on the weak and unsuspecting, as he would in compton: “now i can watch his watch on the tv and be okay/but see i’m on the clock once that watch landin’ in la/remember steal from the rich and givin’ it back to the poor?/well that’s me at these awards.”  to kendrick’s credit, however, the ambivalence and tragedy in the friendship is palpable. while the spirit of his deceased grandmother, voiced through the singer  (8916220), admonishes him to distance himself from his friends ( (9019345)), the pretensions of elites are rendered appropriately absurd next to the pressing needs of the ghetto. this is perhaps most clearly rendered in a brief interlude where the specter of president obama and his limited ability to solve the material and mundane deprivations of the truly disadvantaged come to the fore: “if i was the president/i’d pay my mama’s rent/free my homies and them/ (8960312)/lay in the white house and get high, lord/who ever thought…/master’d take the chains off me?!”  in the end, lamar recoils from the corruption of soul engendered by his choices here, only further underscoring his distance. especially wrenching is lamar’s descent into depression as he reflects on taking advantage of a young mother:  “i remember you was conflicted/misusing your influence/sometimes i did the same/abusing my power, full of resentment…/resentment that turned into a deep depression/found myself screaming in a hotel room”  the guttural screams coming from kendrick’s hotel room are the opening notes of  (8984244) and the culmination of his guilt and crisis of faith. the refrain, “loving you is complicated,” is a self-flagellating response to  (8960235), delivered in an increasingly intoxicated soliloquy. lamenting his sister’s teenage pregnancy, failing to visit a friend on his deathbed, and his general inability to adequately transform and be a part of the lives of his friends and family,  (8984247) is a crucial turning point towards kendrick’s growing conviction that “money can’t stop a suicidal weakness.” other sources of value, purpose, and meaning must inform and inspire our affirmation that life is worth living despite these forms of despair.  from these depths, the album turns markedly with the  (8870340) and  (8870347) produced  (8999531) having stared into the abyss of meaninglessness in  (8999535)  (8999539) sets up this question of life’s affirmation and meaning as a contest between faith in god, and a crisis of faith engendered by injustice and temptation. it might seem odd to treat the worldly question of justice as relevant for such existential and metaphysical speculations, but this is a misguided separation. when lamar proclaims, “wouldn’t you know/we been hurt, been down before…/nigga, when our pride was low/lookin’ at the world like, ‘where do we go?’” this is a question well within the realm of theodicy, namely: is the world hospitable to black folks’ strivings for flourishing and right?   (8916254), the verses themselves detail the complicated struggle to reach this point. they explore kendrick’s anxiety about his vices, and introduce yet another “magical” character, lucy – the female personification of the devil. in both  (8998718) and  (8851580) lucy tempts kendrick with more pernicious promises, leading him back toward the lament about misusing influence and abusing power that ended  (8998722) the difference here, however, is the addition of a moment of life-affirmation: “i didn’t wanna self destruct/the evils of lucy was all around me/so i went runnin’ for answers/until i came home.”  given the problems with kendrick’s initial return to compton in the narrative, however, we should suspect that this gesture toward “home” refers not simply to his hometown, but to something more primordial.  (8851583) which subtly references the  (8931850) notion of “motherland,” suggests that this space is none other than africa. while on  (8870354)  (8905342), lamar traveled to south africa and in almost every in-depth discussion about the album, kendrick returns to this trip as a major influence on not only his music on his entire worldview.  like the comedian  (8870366), the black nationalist icons  (8870369) and  (8870377), and the poet  (8870385), lamar experiences africa as a space of cultural readjustment, restorative values, and moral insight. in the third verse of  (8998742) he has a conversation with another spectral figure, a young boy who bears a striking resemblance to kendrick himself, and offers wisdom that belies his years. suggesting a deep ancestral connection, the boy exclaims, “kendrick you do know my language/you just forgot because of what public schools had painted.” continuing, the boy suggests that not just language and lineage were lost somewhere between africa and compton, but an appropriate sense of significance, of what would genuinely count as human progress:  “oh i forgot,  (8916136) that’s right you’re famous/i used to watch on channel 5, tv was taken/but never mind you’re here right now don’t you mistake it/it’s just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family’s ancestor/make a new list, of everything you thought was progress/and that was bullshit, i mean your life is full of turmoil/spoiled by fantasies of who you are, i feel bad for you/i can attempt to enlighten you, without frightening you.”  these, along with the issues of color discrimination within black communities that lamar tackles in the  (8870414)-assisted  (8851585) are familiar themes in afrocentric and  (8998817) literature.  (8898712), a leading afrocentrist intellectual, writes that it is a  (8898689) writing in response to the problem of  (9036048), or the loss of value, argues that “ f we have lost anything, it is our cultural centeredness; that is, we have been moved off our own platforms.” or, in the last remarks of the preternatural child, “tell your homies especially to come back home.” that this theme, of the relation between an african “home” and a compton “home,” looms largely over to pimp a butterfly was further evidenced when lamar, in a controversial, arresting, and  (9019476) at the 58th grammy awards, ended with  (8898853)  the difficulty of reconciling the reigning ethos of compton with an imagined afro-futurist cultural redemption, however, is immediately thrust into relief with  (8851586) a phone call from compton brings lamar hurtling back to wrestle again with survivor’s guilt, excising his tensions on the rap industry as if he was still “in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce.” wrapping himself in the mantle of compton, he revisits the  (9019505) he most famously unleashed on the unofficially released  (8910088) song,  (8998865) where he challenged a host of leading rappers by name and provocatively declared himself the “king of new york.”  (9024590) to his  (8998879) verse, and the inanity of both rap politics and american politics come in for withering scorn. proclaiming, “ya’ll priorities fucked up/put energy in wrong shit,” lamar draws attention instead to a world where more serious problems, like mass incarceration and gang violence, are unfolding in “a continuous war back in the city.” “hood politics” are, in this register, a distraction – often motivated by the self-serving attempt to prove “the stripes   earned/or maybe how a-1   foundation was.” a similar concern animates the  (8905501) (terrace martin and josef leimberg) produced  (8851592) where lamar  (9024618), particularly among rappers, as pathetic attempts to fit in or impress their peers. but is it possible to transcend these more narcissistic, or self-aggrandizing responses? to answer this, lamar turns again back to africa, and the enchantments of magical realism. on  (8851588) lamar tells the story of pumping gas, when a homeless man approaches to ask him for ten grand for food. a rap superstar, standing alongside a luxury car, lamar nonetheless refuses, assuming the man to be a crack addict. in the last two verses, remarkable for their rich phenomenological description, lamar describes being held in place by the homeless man’s look of disbelief and disappointment. the audacity of his gaze sends lamar, not to a place of mutual recognition, but  (9024642) buoyed by a flood of associations between homelessness, substance abuse, and lack of desert. lamar lets loose an abusive tirade toward the beggar, to which the latter responds by revealing himself to be jesus christ in disguise. set to a richly melancholic  (8999060) score, with guest vocals by the singer and songwriter  (8898883) and the iconic  (8903489),  (8999625) renders literal the christian principle of all human beings as “one in christ jesus” ( (9024800)) and suggest its potential force against the stereotypes, prejudices, and rationalizations that sustain selfishness and injustice.  it is in this spirit, then, that we should understand the paeans to racial equality and justice manifest in  (8999630) and, the incredible standout track,  (8851590) the latter, which is set to a trunk-rattling  (8905546) and  (8910144) instrumental, is arguably the most unadulterated and powerful artistic statement that “black lives matter” since the movement first emerged. gesturing toward his earlier afro-futurist and pan-africanist sentiments, lamar revels in a deeply embodied and inherited notion of blackness, declaring: “i’m african-american, i’m african/i’m black as the moon, heritage of a small village/pardon my residence/came from the bottom of mankind/my hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide.” these statements, far from the ranting of a racial chauvinist, are arrayed against the deep stigma and systemic disadvantages that confront african americans. thus, lamar invokes the subordinate place of impoverished african americans in the social order of the u.s. -- “i mean, it’s evident that i’m irrelevant to society/that’s what you’re telling me, penitentiary would only hire me.”  what separates lamar’s trenchant critique from other protest music, however, is that – in the spirit of  (8903840) – he burrows under the notion of “hate” and “rage” to interrogate the frailties of human beings across the color line. when he proclaims, “i know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself,” to the racial resentment engendered by black success, he suggests the possibility of self-interrogation and self-criticism in his non-black audience. when he asks himself “so why did i weep when  (8910153) was in the street/when gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?” he suggests that the moral strictures of “black lives matter” cannot be contorted such that it does not apply to the plague of violence between african americans.  the intractability of this violence, and our inability to summon a courageous moral response to it, troubles lamar to the core. his suspicion that this failure involves an internalized sense of a lack of self-worth and dignity among african americans receives its fullest exposition, and most sustained therapeutic intervention with the album’s first single,  (8851594): “everybody lack confidence/everybody lack confidence/how many times my potential was anonymous?/how many times the city making me promises?/so i promise this, nigga – i love myself!”  the symmetry with  (8984250) is immediately striking, and it should register immediately that it is, in some sense, a response to the depths of dread and despair on display there. the heard-earned optimism and humble joy exhibited on the record is palpable, suggesting that, in a revitalized christian faith, pan-african identity, and virtuous humility, lamar has discovered a mix of life-affirming ideals that respond adequately, for him, for now, to the challenge of nihilism. the challenge, however, is not simply to secure his own salvation, which would simply reinstate the problem of survivor’s guilt. instead, lamar must somehow become a leader in a project of broad cultural transformation and the establishment of new values.  in the album’s closing song,  (8851597) lamar ends by reflecting on this problem – communing with “the ghost of   mandela](8905598).” lamar visited robbins island in south africa where  (9019352) learning of the enduring faith and dedication that the world-renowned anti-apartheid leader inspired in his followers. this kind of standing and influence, particularly in the scandal-obsessed culture that consumed  (8905622) and others, is incredibly fragile. it demands an extraordinary level of constancy in character and commitment, and even those virtues are no guarantee of one’s impact. in response, kendrick begs for us to “make room for mistakes and depression” as he “lead  this army” to a refounding of meaningful ideals and a more affirmative, hopeful orientation toward life amidst the decadence of the age.  as  (8999380) winds down, and lamar reads the full version of the poem that has been building throughout the album in between tracks, we hear him turn immediately to a conversation with the deceased  (8910214), as if the entire album or at least its closing poem, has been a performance principally for one man.  (8864435) lamar asks shakur a series of questions that speak to the same questions that have guided the album throughout – social injustice, survivor’s guilt, religious faith, and black identity and resistance. most fascinating, however, is that lamar presses one subtle objection to shakur, whose words, originally uttered in the wake of the  (8916361), but hauntingly resonant post-baltimore and ferguson in 2016, portend the evolution of rioting and looting into “bloodshed for real…like  (8916426), 1831.” against this, lamar suggests that the “only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations.” describing his creative process, lamar says that “sometimes i…get behind a mic and i don’t know what type of energy i’mma push out, or where it comes from.” shakur’s voice, as if in genuine conversation, adds that this is because “we ain’t even really rappin’, we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us.” this quote, seemingly uttered by a dead man himself in perhaps the album’s most surreal moment, suggests that lamar is an annointed conduit for these stories, perhaps even shakur’s story, and the inheritor of the struggle to shape culture.  lamar ends to pimp a butterfly by reading a short exposition of its central metaphor to shakur. in it, the butterfly represents “the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar.” he talks of how, when trapped inside the cocoon – the “institutionalized” mind and body meant to subordinate the potential butterfly to the caterpillar’s aims – the caterpillar actually can undertake severe introspection. “when trapped inside these walls,” lamar continues, “certain ideas take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city.” these new ideas are the emergent wings of the butterfly, and that which allows it to “shed light on situations that the caterpillar never considered,” and show it the “talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty” within itself. when lamar finishes, however, he asks shakur for his perspective and no answer is forthcoming. the silence suggests that the magic has dissipated, and lamar is again alone, in the m.a.a.d. city, with work to do and souls to save.embed"

"bad pharma lyrics1 missing data sponsors get the answer they want   before we get going, we need to establish one thing beyond any doubt: industry-funded trials are more likely to produce a positive, flattering result than independently-funded trials. this is our core premise, and you’re about to read a very short chapter, because this is one of the most well-documented phenomena in the growing field of ‘research about research’. it has also become much easier to study in recent years, because the rules on declaring industry funding have become a little clearer.  we can begin with some recent work: in 2010, three researchers from harvard and toronto found all the trials looking at five major classes of drug – antidepressants, ulcer drugs and so on – then measured two key features: were they positive, and were they funded by industry?1 they found over five hundred trials in total: 85 per cent of the industry-funded studies were positive, but only 50 per cent of the government-funded trials were. that’s a very significant difference. in 2007, researchers looked at every published trial that set out to explore the benefit of a statin.2 these are cholesterol-lowering drugs which reduce your risk of having a heart attack, they are prescribed in very large quantities, and they will loom large in this book. this study found 192 trials in total, either comparing one statin against another, or comparing a statin against a different kind of treatment. once the researchers controlled for other factors (we’ll delve into what this means later), they found that industry-funded trials were twenty times more likely to give results favouring the test drug. again, that’s a very big difference.  we’ll do one more. in 2006, researchers looked into every trial of psychiatric drugs in four academic journals over a ten-year period, finding 542 trial outcomes in total. industry sponsors got favourable outcomes for their own drug 78 per cent of the time, while independently-funded trials only gave a positive result in 48 per cent of cases. if you were a competing drug put up against the sponsor’s drug in a trial, you were in for a pretty rough ride: you would only win a measly 28 per cent of the time.3  these are dismal, frightening results, but they come from individual studies. when there has been lots of research in a field, it’s always possible that someone – like me, for example – could cherry-pick the results, and give a partial view. i could, in essence, be doing exactly what i accuse the pharmaceutical industry of doing, and only telling you about the studies that support my case, while hiding the reassuring ones from you.  to guard against this risk, researchers invented the systematic review. we’ll explore this in more detail soon (p.14), since it’s at the core of modern medicine, but in essence a systematic review is simple: instead of just mooching through the research literature, consciously or unconsciously picking out papers here and there that support your pre-existing beliefs, you take a scientific, systematic approach to the very process of looking for scientific evidence, ensuring that your evidence is as complete and representative as possible of all the research that has ever been done.  systematic reviews are very, very onerous. in 2003, by coincidence, two were published, both looking specifically at the question we’re interested in. they took all the studies ever published that looked at whether industry funding is associated with pro-industry results. each took a slightly different approach to finding research papers, and both found that industry-funded trials were, overall, about four times more likely to report positive results.4 a further review in 2007 looked at the new studies that had been published in the four years after these two earlier reviews: it found twenty more pieces of work, and all but two showed that industry-sponsored trials were more likely to report flattering results.5  i am setting out this evidence at length because i want to be absolutely clear that there is no doubt on the issue. industry-sponsored trials give favourable results, and that is not my opinion, or a hunch from the occasional passing study. this is a very well-documented problem, and it has been researched extensively, without anybody stepping out to take effective action, as we shall see.  there is one last study i’d like to tell you about. it turns out that this pattern of industry-funded trials being vastly more likely to give positive results persists even when you move away from published academic papers, and look instead at trial reports from academic conferences, where data often appears for the first time (in fact, as we shall see, sometimes trial results only appear at an academic conference, with very little information on how the study was conducted).  fries and krishnan studied all the research abstracts presented at the 2001 american college of rheumatology meetings which reported any kind of trial, and acknowledged industry sponsorship, in order to find out what proportion had results that favoured the sponsor’s drug. there is a small punch-line coming, and to understand it we need to cover a little of what an academic paper looks like. in general, the results section is extensive: the raw numbers are given for each outcome, and for each possible causal factor, but not just as raw figures. the ‘ranges’ are given, subgroups are perhaps explored, statistical tests are conducted, and each detail of the result is described in table form, and in shorter narrative form in the text, explaining the most important results. this lengthy process is usually spread over several pages.  in fries and krishnan   this level of detail was unnecessary. the results section is a single, simple, and – i like to imagine – fairly passive-aggressive sentence:  the results from every rct (45 out of 45) favored the drug of the sponsor.  this extreme finding has a very interesting side effect, for those interested in time-saving shortcuts. since every industry-sponsored trial had a positive result, that’s all you’d need to know about a piece of work to predict its outcome: if it was funded by industry, you could know with absolute certainty that the trial found the drug was great.  how does this happen? how do industry-sponsored trials almost always manage to get a positive result? it is, as far as anyone can be certain, a combination of factors. it may be that companies are more likely to run trials when they’re more confident their treatment is going to ‘win’; this sounds reasonable, although even this conflicts with the ethical principle that you should only do a trial when there’s genuine uncertainty about which treatment is best (otherwise you’re exposing half of your participants to a treatment you already know to be inferior). sometimes the chances of one treatment winning can be increased with outright design flaws. you can compare your new drug with something you know to be rubbish – an existing drug at an inadequate dose, perhaps, or a placebo sugar pill that does almost nothing. you can choose your patients very carefully, so they are more likely to get better on your treatment. you can peek at the results halfway through, and stop your trial early if they look good (which is – for interesting reasons we shall discuss – statistical poison). and so on.  but before we get to these fascinating methodological twists and quirks, these nudges and bumps that stop a trial from being a fair test of whether a treatment works or not, there is something very much simpler at hand. sometimes drug companies conduct lots of trials, and when they see that the results are unflattering, they simply fail to publish them. this is not a new problem, and it’s not limited to medicine. in fact, this issue of negative results that go missing in action cuts into almost every corner of science. it distorts findings in fields as diverse as brain imaging and economics, it makes a mockery of all our efforts to exclude bias from our studies, and despite everything that regulators, drug companies and even some academics will tell you, it is a problem that has been left unfixed for decades.  in fact, it is so deep-rooted that even if we fixed it today – right now, for good, forever, without any flaws or loopholes in our legislation – that still wouldn’t help, because we would still be practising medicine, cheerfully making decisions about which treatment is best, on the basis of decades of medical evidence which is – as you’ve now seen – fundamentally distorted.  but there is a way ahead.  why missing data matters  reboxetine is a drug i myself have prescribed. other drugs had done nothing for this particular patient, so we wanted to try something new. i’d read the trial data before i wrote the prescription, and found only well-designed, fair tests, with overwhelmingly positive results. reboxetine was better than placebo, and as good as any other antidepressant in head-to-head comparisons. it’s approved for use by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (the mhra), which governs all drugs in the uk. millions of doses are prescribed every year, around the world. reboxetine was clearly a safe and effective treatment. the patient and i discussed the evidence briefly, and agreed it was the right treatment to try next. i signed a piece of paper, a prescription, saying i wanted my patient to have this drug.  but we had both been misled. in october 2010 a group of researchers were finally able to bring together all the trials that had ever been conducted on reboxetine.6 through a long process of investigation – searching in academic journals, but also arduously requesting data from the manufacturers and gathering documents from regulators – they were able to assemble all the data, both from trials that were published, and from those that had never appeared in academic papers.  when all this trial data was put together it produced a shocking picture. seven trials had been conducted comparing reboxetine against placebo. only one, conducted in 254 patients, had a neat, positive result, and that one was published in an academic journal, for doctors and researchers to read. but six more trials were conducted, in almost ten times as many patients. all of them showed that reboxetine was no better than a dummy sugar pill. none of these trials was published. i had no idea they existed.  it got worse. the trials comparing reboxetine against other drugs showed exactly the same picture: three small studies, 507 patients in total, showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other drug. they were all published. but 1,657 patients’ worth of data was left unpublished, and this unpublished data showed that patients on reboxetine did worse than those on other drugs. if all this wasn’t bad enough, there was also the side-effects data. the drug looked fine in the trials which appeared in the academic literature: but when we saw the unpublished studies, it turned out that patients were more likely to have side effects, more likely to drop out of taking the drug, and more likely to withdraw from the trial because of side effects, if they were taking reboxetine rather than one of its competitors.  if you’re ever in any doubt about whether the stories in this book make me angry – and i promise you, whatever happens, i will keep to the data, and strive to give a fair picture of everything we know – you need only look at this story. i did everything a doctor is supposed to do. i read all the papers, i critically appraised them, i understood them, i discussed them with the patient, and we made a decision together, based on the evidence. in the published data, reboxetine was a safe and effective drug. in reality, it was no better than a sugar pill, and worse, it does more harm than good. as a doctor i did something which, on the balance of all the evidence, harmed my patient, simply because unflattering data was left unpublished.  if you find that amazing, or outrageous, your journey is just beginning. because nobody broke any law in that situation, reboxetine is still on the market, and the system that allowed all this to happen is still in play, for all drugs, in all countries in the world. negative data goes missing, for all treatments, in all areas of science. the regulators and professional bodies we would reasonably expect to stamp out such practices have failed us.  in a few pages, we will walk through the literature that demonstrates all of this beyond any doubt, showing that ‘publication bias’ – the process whereby negative results go unpublished – is endemic throughout the whole of medicine and academia; and that regulators have failed to do anything about it, despite decades of data showing the size of the problem. but before we get to that research, i need you to feel its implications, so we need to think about why missing data matters.  evidence is the only way we can possibly know if something works – or doesn’t work – in medicine. we proceed by testing things, as cautiously as we can, in head-to-head trials, and gathering together all of the evidence. this last step is crucial: if i withhold half the data from you, it’s very easy for me to convince you of something that isn’t true. if i toss a coin a hundred times, for example, but only tell you about the results when it lands heads-up, i can convince you that this is a two-headed coin. but that doesn’t mean i really do have a two-headed coin: it means i’m misleading you, and you’re a fool for letting me get away with it. this is exactly the situation we tolerate in medicine, and always have. researchers are free to do as many trials as they wish, and then choose which ones to publish.  the repercussions of this go way beyond simply misleading doctors about the benefits and harms of interventions for patients, and way beyond trials. medical research isn’t an abstract academic pursuit: it’s about people, so every time we fail to publish a piece of research we expose real, living people to unnecessary, avoidable suffering. tgn1412  in march 2006, six volunteers arrived at a london hospital to take place in a trial. it was the first time a new drug called tgn1412 had ever been given to humans, and they were paid £2,000 each.7 within an hour these six men developed headaches, muscle aches, and a feeling of unease. then things got worse: high temperatures, restlessness, periods of forgetting who and where they were. soon they were shivering, flushed, their pulses racing, their blood pressure falling. then, a cliff: one went into respiratory failure, the oxygen levels in his blood falling rapidly as his lungs filled with fluid. nobody knew why. another dropped his blood pressure to just 65/40, stopped breathing properly, and was rushed to an intensive care unit, knocked out, intubated, mechanically ventilated. within a day all six were disastrously unwell: fluid on their lungs, struggling to breathe, their kidneys failing, their blood clotting uncontrollably throughout their bodies, and their white blood cells disappearing. doctors threw everything they could at them: steroids, antihistamines, immune-system receptor blockers. all six were ventilated on intensive care. they stopped producing urine; they were all put on dialysis; their blood was replaced, first slowly, then rapidly; they needed plasma, red cells, platelets. the fevers continued. one developed pneumonia. and then the blood stopped getting to their peripheries. their fingers and toes went flushed, then brown, then black, and then began to rot and die. with heroic effort, all escaped, at least, with their lives.  the department of health convened an expert scientific group to try to understand what had happened, and from this two concerns were raised.8 firstly: can we stop things like this from happening again? it’s plainly foolish, for example, to give a new experimental treatment to all six participants in a ‘first-in-man’ trial at the same time, if that treatment is a completely unknown quantity. new drugs should be given to participants in a staggered process, slowly, over a day. this idea received considerable attention from regulators and the media.  less noted was a second concern: could we have foreseen this disaster? tgn1412 is a molecule that attaches to a receptor called cd28 on the white blood cells of the immune system. it was a new and experimental treatment, and it interfered with the immune system in ways that are poorly understood, and hard to model in animals (unlike, say, blood pressure, because immune systems are very variable between different species). but as the final report found, there was experience with a similar intervention: it had simply not been published. one researcher presented the inquiry with unpublished data on a study he had conducted in a single human subject a full ten years earlier, using an antibody that attached to the cd3, cd2 and cd28 receptors. the effects of this antibody had parallels with those of tgn1412, and the subject on whom it was tested had become unwell. but nobody could possibly have known that, because these results were never shared with the scientific community. they sat unpublished, unknown, when they could have helped save six men from a terrifying, destructive, avoidable ordeal.  that original researcher could not foresee the specific harm he contributed to, and it’s hard to blame him as an individual, because he operated in an academic culture where leaving data unpublished was regarded as completely normal. the same culture exists today. the final report on tgn1412 concluded that sharing the results of all first-in-man studies was essential: they should be published, every last one, as a matter of routine. but phase 1 trial results weren’t published then, and they’re still not published now. in 2009, for the first time, a study was published looking specifically at how many of these first-in-man trials get published, and how many remain hidden.9 they took all such trials approved by one ethics committee over a year. after four years, nine out of ten remain unpublished; after eight years, four out of five were still unpublished.  in medicine, as we shall see time and again, research is not abstract: it relates directly to life, death, suffering and pain. with every one of these unpublished studies we are potentially exposed, quite unnecessarily, to another tgn1412. even a huge international news story, with horrific images of young men brandishing blackened feet and hands from hospital beds, wasn’t enough to get movement, because the issue of missing data is too complicated to fit in one sentence.  when we don’t share the results of basic research, such as a small first-in-man study, we expose people to unnecessary risks in the future. was this an extreme case? is the problem limited to early, experimental, new drugs, in small groups of trial participants? no.  in the 1980s, doctors began giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to all patients who’d had a heart attack. this practice made perfect sense on paper: we knew that anti-arrhythmic drugs helped prevent abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that people who’ve had a heart attack are quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that often these went unnoticed, undiagnosed and untreated. giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to everyone who’d had a heart attack was a simple, sensible, preventive measure.  unfortunately, it turned out that we were wrong. this prescribing practice, with the best of intentions, on the best of principles, actually killed people. and because heart attacks are very common, it killed them in very large numbers: well over 100,000 people died unnecessarily before it was realised that the fine balance between benefit and risk was completely different for patients without a proven abnormal heart rhythm.  could anyone have predicted this? sadly, yes, they could have. a trial in 1980 tested a new anti-arrhythmic drug, lorcainide, in a small number of men who’d had a heart attack – less than a hundred – to see if it was any use. nine out of forty-eight men on lorcainide died, compared with one out of forty-seven on placebo. the drug was early in its development cycle, and not long after this study it was dropped for commercial reasons. because it wasn’t on the market, nobody even thought to publish the trial. the researchers assumed it was an idiosyncrasy of their molecule, and gave it no further thought. if they had published, we would have been much more cautious about trying other anti-arrhythmic drugs on people with heart attacks, and the phenomenal death toll – over 100,000 people in their graves prematurely – might have been stopped sooner. more than a decade later, the researchers finally did publish their results, with a mea culpa, recognising the harm they had done by not sharing them earlier:  when we carried out our study in 1980, we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance. the development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons, and this study was therefore never published; it is now a good example of ‘publication bias’. the results described here might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead.10  as we shall shortly see, this problem of unpublished data is widespread throughout medicine, and indeed the whole of academia, even though the scale of the problem, and the harm it causes, have been documented beyond any doubt. we will see stories on basic cancer research, tamiflu, cholesterol blockbusters, obesity drugs, antidepressants and more, with evidence that goes from the dawn of medicine to the present day, and data that is still being withheld, right now, as i write, on widely used drugs which many of you reading this book will have taken this morning. we will also see how regulators and academic bodies have repeatedly failed to address the problem.  because researchers are free to bury any result they please, patients are exposed to harm on a staggering scale throughout the whole of medicine, from research to practice. doctors can have no idea about the true effects of the treatments they give. does this drug really work best, or have i simply been deprived of half the data? nobody can tell. is this expensive drug worth the money, or have the data simply been massaged? no one can tell. will this drug kill patients? is there any evidence that it’s dangerous? no one can tell.  this is a bizarre situation to arise in medicine, a discipline where everything is supposed to be based on evidence, and where everyday practice is bound up in medico-legal anxiety. in one of the most regulated corners of human conduct we’ve taken our eyes off the ball, and allowed the evidence driving practice to be polluted and distorted. it seems unimaginable. we will now see how deep this problem goes.  why we summarise data  missing data has been studied extensively in medicine. but before i lay out that evidence, we need to understand exactly why it matters, from a scientific perspective. and for that we need to understand systematic reviews and ‘meta-analysis’. between them, these are two of the most powerful ideas in modern medicine. they are incredibly simple, but they were invented shockingly late.  when we want to find out if something works or not, we do a trial. this is a very simple process, and the first recorded attempt at some kind of trial was in the bible (daniel 1:12, if you’re interested). firstly, you need an unanswered question: for example, ‘does giving steroids to a woman delivering a premature baby increase the chances of that baby surviving?’ then you find some relevant participants, in this case, mothers about to deliver a premature baby. you’ll need a reasonable number of them, let’s say two hundred for this trial. then you divide them into two groups at random, give the mothers in one group the current best treatment (whatever that is in your town), while the mothers in the other group get current best treatment plus some steroids. finally, when all two hundred women have gone through your trial, you count up how many babies survived in each group.  this is a real-world question, and lots of trials were done on this topic, starting from 1972 onwards: two trials showed that steroids saved lives, but five showed no significant benefit. now, you will often hear that doctors disagree when the evidence is mixed, and this is exactly that kind of situation. a doctor with a strong pre-existing belief that steroids work – perhaps preoccupied with some theoretical molecular mechanism, by which the drug might do something useful in the body – could come along and say: ‘look at these two positive trials! of course we must give steroids!’ a doctor with a strong prior intuition that steroids were rubbish might point at the five negative trials and say: ‘overall the evidence shows no benefit. why take a risk?’  up until very recently, this was basically how medicine progressed. people would write long, languorous review articles – essays surveying the literature – in which they would cite the trial data they’d come across in a completely unsystematic fashion, often reflecting their own prejudices and values. then, in the 1980s, people began to do something called a ‘systematic review’. this is a clear, systematic survey of the literature, with the intention of getting all the trial data you can possibly find on one topic, without being biased towards any particular set of findings. in a systematic review, you describe exactly how you looked for data: which databases you searched, which search engines and indexes you used, even what words you searched for. you pre-specify the kinds of studies that can be included in your review, and then you present everything you’ve found, including the papers you rejected, with an explanation of why. by doing this, you ensure that your methods are fully transparent, replicable and open to criticism, providing the reader with a clear and complete picture of the evidence. it may sound like a simple idea, but systematic reviews are extremely rare outside clinical medicine, and are quietly one of the most important and transgressive ideas of the past forty years.  when you’ve got all the trial data in one place, you can conduct something called a meta-analysis, where you bring all the results together in one giant spreadsheet, pool all the data and get one single, summary figure, the most accurate summary of all the data on one clinical question. the output of this is called a ‘blobbogram’, and you can see one on the opposite page, in the logo of the cochrane collaboration, a global, non-profit academic organisation that has been producing gold-standard reviews of evidence on important questions in medicine since the 1980s.  this blobbogram shows the results of all the trials done on giving steroids to help premature babies survive. each horizontal line is a trial: if that line is further to the left, then the trial showed steroids were beneficial and saved lives. the central, vertical line is the ‘line of no effect’: and if the horizontal line of the trial touches the line of no effect, then that trial showed no statistically significant benefit. some trials are represented by longer horizontal lines: these were smaller trials, with fewer participants, which means they are prone to more error, so the estimate of the benefit has more uncertainty, and therefore the horizontal line is longer. finally, the diamond at the bottom shows the ‘summary effect’: this is the overall benefit of the intervention, pooling together the results of all the individual trials. these are much narrower than the lines for individual trials, because the estimate is much more accurate: it is summarising the effect of the drug in many more patients. on this blobbogram you can see – because the diamond is a long way from the line of no effect – that giving steroids is hugely beneficial. in fact, it reduces the chances of a premature baby dying by almost half.  the amazing thing about this blobbogram is that it had to be invented, and this happened very late in medicine’s history. for many years we had all the information we needed to know that steroids saved lives, but nobody knew they were effective, because nobody did a systematic review until 1989. as a result, the treatment wasn’t given widely, and huge numbers of babies died unnecessarily; not because we didn’t have the information, but simply because we didn’t synthesise it together properly.  in case you think this is an isolated case, it’s worth examining exactly how broken medicine was until frighteningly recent times. the diagram on the opposite page contains two blobbograms, or ‘forest plots’, showing all the trials ever conducted to see whether giving streptokinase, a clot-busting drug, improves survival in patients who have had a heart attack.11  look first only at the forest plot on the left. this is a conventional forest plot, from an academic journal, so it’s a little busier than the stylised one in the cochrane logo. the principles, however, are exactly the same. each horizontal line is a trial, and you can see that there is a hodgepodge of results, with some trials showing a benefit (they don’t touch the vertical line of no effect, headed ‘1’) and some showing no benefit (they do cross that line). at the bottom, however, you can see the summary effect – a dot on this old-fashioned blobbogram, rather than a diamond. and you can see very clearly that overall, streptokinase saves lives.  so what’s that on the right? it’s something called a cumulative meta-analysis. if you look at the list of studies on the left of the diagram, you can see that they are arranged in order of date. the cumulative meta-analysis on the right adds in each new trial’s results, as they arrived over history, to the previous trials’ results. this gives the best possible running estimate, each year, of how the evidence would have looked at that time, if anyone had bothered to do a meta-analysis on all the data available to them. from this cumulative blobbogram you can see that the horizontal lines, the ‘summary effects’, narrow over time as more and more data is collected, and the estimate of the overall benefit of this treatment becomes more accurate. you can also see that these horizontal lines stopped touching the vertical line of no effect a very long time ago – and crucially, they do so a long time before we started giving streptokinase to everyone with a heart attack.  in case you haven’t spotted it for yourself already – to be fair, the entire medical profession was slow to catch on – this chart has devastating implications. heart attacks are an incredibly common cause of death. we had a treatment that worked, and we had all the information we needed to know that it worked, but once again we didn’t bring it together systematically to get that correct answer. half of the people in those trials at the bottom of the blobbogram were randomly assigned to receive no streptokinase, i think unethically, because we had all the information we needed to know that streptokinase worked: they were deprived of effective treatments. but they weren’t alone, because so were most of the rest of the people in the world at the time.  these stories illustrate, i hope, why systematic reviews and meta-analyses are so important: we need to bring together all of the evidence on a question, not just cherry-pick the bits that we stumble upon, or intuitively like the look of. mercifully the medical profession has come to recognise this over the past couple of decades, and systematic reviews with meta-analyses are now used almost universally, to ensure that we have the most accurate possible summary of all the trials that have been done on a particular medical question.  but these stories also demonstrate why missing trial results are so dangerous. if one researcher or doctor ‘cherry-picks’, when summarising the existing evidence, and looks only at the trials that support their hunch, then they can produce a misleading picture of the research. that is a problem for that one individual (and for anyone who is unwise or unlucky enough to be influenced by them). but if we are all missing the negative trials, the entire medical and academic community, around the world, then when we pool the evidence to get the best possible view of what works – as we must do – we are all completely misled. we get a misleading impression of the treatment’s effectiveness: we incorrectly exaggerate its benefits; or perhaps even find incorrectly that an intervention was beneficial, when in reality it did harm.  now that you understand the importance of systematic reviews, you can see why missing data matters. but you can also appreciate that when i explain how much trial data is missing, i am giving you a clean overview of the literature, because i will be explaining that evidence using systematic reviews.  how much data is missing?  if you want to prove that trials have been left unpublished, you have an interesting problem: you need to prove the existence of studies you don’t have access to. to work around this, people have developed a simple approach: you identify a group of trials you know have been conducted and completed, then check to see if they have been published. finding a list of completed trials is the tricky part of this job, and to achieve it people have used various strategies: trawling the lists of trials that have been approved by ethics committees (or ‘institutional review boards’ in the usa), for example; or chasing up the trials discussed by researchers at conferences.  in 2008 a group of researchers decided to check for publication of every trial that had ever been reported to the us food and drug administration for all the antidepressants that came onto the market between 1987 and 2004.12 this was no small task. the fda archives contain a reasonable amount of information on all the trials that were submitted to the regulator in order to get a licence for a new drug. but that’s not all the trials, by any means, because those conducted after the drug has come onto the market will not appear there; and the information that is provided by the fda is hard to search, and often scanty. but it is an important subset of the trials, and more than enough for us to begin exploring how often trials go missing, and why. it’s also a representative slice of trials from all the major drug companies.  the researchers found seventy-four studies in total, representing 12,500 patients’ worth of data. thirty-eight of these trials had positive results, and found that the new drug worked; thirty-six were negative. the results were therefore an even split between success and failure for the drugs, in reality. then the researchers set about looking for these trials in the published academic literature, the material available to doctors and patients. this provided a very different picture. thirty-seven of the positive trials – all but one – were published in full, often with much fanfare. but the trials with negative results had a very different fate: only three were published. twenty-two were simply lost to history, never appearing anywhere other than in those dusty, disorganised, thin fda files. the remaining eleven which had negative results in the fda summaries did appear in the academic literature, but were written up as if the drug was a success. if you think this sounds absurd, i agree: we will see in chapter 4, on ‘bad trials’, how a study’s results can be reworked and polished to distort and exaggerate its findings.  this was a remarkable piece of work, spread over twelve drugs from all the major manufacturers, with no stand-out bad guy. it very clearly exposed a broken system: in reality we have thirty-eight positive trials and thirty-six negative ones; in the academic literature we have forty-eight positive trials and three negative ones. take a moment to flip back and forth between those in your mind: ‘thirty-eight positive trials, thirty-six negative’; or ‘forty-eight positive trials and only three negative’.  if we were talking about one single study, from one single group of researchers, who decided to delete half their results because they didn’t give the overall picture they wanted, then we would quite correctly call that act ‘research misconduct’. yet somehow when exactly the same phenomenon occurs, but with whole studies going missing, by the hands of hundreds and thousands of individuals, spread around the world, in both the public and private sector, we accept it as a normal part of life.13 it passes by, under the watchful eyes of regulators and professional bodies who do nothing, as routine, despite the undeniable impact it has on patients.  even more strange is this: we’ve known about the problem of negative studies going missing for almost as long as people have been doing serious science.  this was first formally documented by a psychologist called theodore sterling in 1959.14 he went through every paper published in the four big psychology journals of the time, and found that 286 out of 294 reported a statistically significant result. this, he explained, was plainly fishy: it couldn’t possibly be a fair representation of every study that had been conducted, because if we believed that, we’d have to believe that almost every theory ever tested by a psychologist in an experiment had turned out to be correct. if psychologists really were so great at predicting results, there’d hardly be any point in bothering to run experiments at all. in 1995, at the end of his career, the same researcher came back to the same question, half a lifetime later, and found that almost nothing had changed.15  sterling was the first to put these ideas into a formal academic context, but the basic truth had been recognised for many centuries. francis bacon explained in 1620 that we often mislead ourselves by only remembering the times something worked, and forgetting those when it didn’t.16 fowler in 1786 listed the cases he’d seen treated with arsenic, and pointed out that he could have glossed over the failures, as others might be tempted to do, but had included them.17 to do otherwise, he explained, would have been misleading.  yet it was only three decades ago that people started to realise that missing trials posed a serious problem for medicine. in 1980 elina hemminki found that almost half the trials conducted in the mid-1970s in finland and sweden had been left unpublished.18 then, in 1986, an american researcher called robert simes decided to investigate the trials on a new treatment for ovarian cancer. this was an important study, because it looked at a life-or-death question. combination chemotherapy for this kind of cancer has very tough side effects, and knowing this, many researchers had hoped it might be better to give a single ‘alkylating agent’ drug first, before moving on to full chemotherapy. simes looked at all the trials published on this question in the academic literature, read by doctors and academics. from this, giving a single drug first looked like a great idea: women with advanced ovarian cancer (which is not a good diagnosis to have) who were on the alkylating agent alone were significantly more likely to survive longer.  then simes had a smart idea. he knew that sometimes trials can go unpublished, and he had heard that papers with less ‘exciting’ results are the most likely to go missing. to prove that this has happened, though, is a tricky business: you need to find a fair, representative sample of all the trials that have been conducted, and then compare their results with the smaller pool of trials that have been published, to see if there are any embarrassing differences. there was no easy way to get this information from the medicines regulator (we will discuss this problem in some detail later), so instead he went to the international cancer research data bank. this contained a register of interesting trials that were happening in the usa, including most of the ones funded by the government, and many others from around the world. it was by no means a complete list, but it did have one crucial feature: the trials were registered before their results came in, so any list compiled from this source would be, if not complete, at least a representative sample of all the research that had ever been done, and not biased by whether their results were positive or negative.  when simes compared the results of the published trials against the pre-registered trials, the results were disturbing. looking at the academic literature – the studies that researchers and journal editors chose to publish – alkylating agents alone looked like a great idea, reducing the rate of death from advanced ovarian cancer significantly. but when you looked only at the pre-registered trials – the unbiased, fair sample of all the trials ever conducted – the new treatment was no better than old-fashioned chemotherapy.  simes immediately recognised – as i hope you will too – that the question of whether one form of cancer treatment is better than another was small fry compared to the depth charge he was about to set off in the medical literature. everything we thought we knew about whether treatments worked or not was probably distorted, to an extent that might be hard to measure, but that would certainly have a major impact on patient care. we were seeing the positive results, and missing the negative ones. there was one clear thing we should do about this: start a registry of all clinical trials, demand that people register their study before they start, and insist that they publish the results at the end.  that was 1986. since then, a generation later, we have done very badly. in this book, i promise i won’t overwhelm you with data. but at the same time, i don’t want any drug company, or government regulator, or professional body, or anyone who doubts this whole story, to have any room to wriggle. so i’ll now go through all the evidence on missing trials, as briefly as possible, showing the main approaches that have been used. all of what you are about to read comes from the most current systematic reviews on the subject, so you can be sure that it is a fair and unbiased summary of the results.  one research approach is to get all the trials that a medicines regulator has record of, from the very early ones done for the purposes of getting a licence for a new drug, and then check to see if they all appear in the academic literature. that’s the method we saw used in the paper mentioned above, where researchers sought out every paper on twelve antidepressants, and found that a 50/50 split of positive and negative results turned into forty-eight positive papers and just three negative ones. this method has been used extensively in several different areas of medicine:     * lee and colleagues, for example, looked for all of the 909 trials      submitted alongside marketing applications for all ninety new      drugs that came onto the market from 2001 to 2002: they      found that 66 per cent of the trials with significant results      were published, compared with only 36 per cent of the rest.19     * melander, in 2003, looked for all forty-two trials on five      antidepressants that were submitted to the swedish drug      regulator in the process of getting a marketing authorisation:      all twenty-one studies with significant results were published;      only 81 per cent of those finding no benefit were published.20     * rising et al., in 2008, found more of those distorted write-ups      that we’ll be dissecting later: they looked for all trials on two      years’ worth of approved drugs. in the fda’s summary of      the results, once those could be found, there were 164 trials.      those with favourable outcomes were a full four times more      likely to be published in academic papers than those with      negative outcomes. on top of that, four of the trials with      negative outcomes changed, once they appeared in the      academic literature, to favour the drug.21  if you prefer, you can look at conference presentations: a huge amount of research gets presented at conferences, but our current best estimate is that only about half of it ever appears in the academic literature.22 studies presented only at conferences are almost impossible to find, or cite, and are especially hard to assess, because so little information is available on the specific methods used in the research (often as little as a paragraph). and as you will see shortly, not every trial is a fair test of a treatment. some can be biased by design, so these details matter.  the most recent systematic review of studies looking at what happens to conference papers was done in 2010, and it found thirty separate studies looking at whether negative conference presentations – in fields as diverse as anaesthetics, cystic fibrosis, oncology, and a&e – disappear before becoming fully-fledged academic papers.23 overwhelmingly, unflattering results are much more likely to go missing.  if you’re very lucky, you can track down a list of trials whose existence was publicly recorded before they were started, perhaps on a register that was set up to explore that very question. from the pharmaceutical industry, up until very recently, you’d be very lucky to find such a list in the public domain. for publicly-funded research the story is a little different, and here we start to learn a new lesson: although the vast majority of trials are conducted by the industry, with the result that they set the tone for the community, this phenomenon is not limited to the commercial sector.     * by 1997 there were already four studies in a systematic review      on this approach. they found that studies with significant      results were two and a half times more likely to get      published than those without.24     * a paper from 1998 looked at all trials from two groups of      triallists sponsored by the us national institutes of health over      the preceding ten years, and found, again, that studies with      significant results were more likely to be published.25     * another looked at drug trials notified to the finnish national      agency, and found that 47 per cent of the positive results      were published, but only 11 per cent of the negative ones.26     * another looked at all the trials that had passed through the      pharmacy department of an eye hospital since 1963: 93 per      cent of the significant results were published, but only 70 per      cent of the negative ones.27  the point being made in this blizzard of data is simple: this is not an under-researched area; the evidence has been with us for a long time, and it is neither contradictory nor ambiguous.  two french studies in 2005 and 2006 took a new approach: they went to ethics committees, and got lists of all the studies they had approved, and then found out from the investigators whether the trials had produced positive or negative results, before finally tracking down the published academic papers.28 the first study found that significant results were twice as likely to be published; the second that they were four times as likely. in britain, two researchers sent a questionnaire to all the lead investigators on 101 projects paid for by nhs r&d: it’s not industry research, but it’s worth noting anyway. this produced an unusual result: there was no statistically significant difference in the publication rates of positive and negative papers.29  but it’s not enough simply to list studies. systematically taking all the evidence that we have so far, what do we see overall?  it’s not ideal to lump every study of this type together in one giant spreadsheet, to produce a summary figure on publication bias, because they are all very different, in different fields, with different methods. this is a concern in many meta-analyses (though it shouldn’t be overstated: if there are lots of trials comparing one treatment against placebo, say, and they’re all using the same outcome measurement, then you might be fine just lumping them all in together).  but you can reasonably put some of these studies together in groups. the most current systematic review on publication bias, from 2010, from which the examples above are taken, draws together the evidence from various fields.30 twelve comparable studies follow up conference presentations, and taken together they find that a study with a significant finding is 1.62 times more likely to be published. for the four studies taking lists of trials from before they started, overall, significant results were 2.4 times more likely to be published. those are our best estimates of the scale of the problem. they are current, and they are damning.  all of this missing data is not simply an abstract academic matter: in the real world of medicine, published evidence is used to make treatment decisions. this problem goes to the core of everything that doctors do, so it’s worth considering in some detail what impact it has on medical practice. firstly, as we saw in the case of reboxetine, doctors and patients are misled about the effects of the medicines they use, and can end up making decisions that cause avoidable suffering, or even death. we might also choose unnecessarily expensive treatments, having been misled into thinking they are more effective than cheaper older drugs. this wastes money, ultimately depriving patients of other treatments, since funding for health care is never infinite.  it’s also worth being clear that this data is withheld from everyone in medicine, from top to bottom. nice, for example, is the national institute for health and clinical excellence, created by the british government to conduct careful, unbiased summaries of all the evidence on new treatments. it is unable either to identify or to access data that has been withheld by researchers or companies on a drug’s effectiveness: nice has no more legal right to that data than you or i do, even though it is making decisions about effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, on behalf of the nhs, for millions of people. in fact, as we shall see, the mhra and ema (the european medicines agency) – the regulators that decide which drugs can go on the market in the uk – often have access to this information, but do not share it with the public, with doctors, or with nice. this is an extraordinary and perverse situation.  so, while doctors are kept in the dark, patients are exposed to inferior treatments, ineffective treatments, unnecessary treatments, and unnecessarily expensive treatments that are no better than cheap ones; governments pay for unnecessarily expensive treatments, and mop up the cost of harms created by inadequate or harmful treatment; and individual participants in trials, such as those in the tgn1412 study, are exposed to terrifying, life-threatening ordeals, resulting in lifelong scars, again quite unnecessarily.  at the same time, the whole of the research project in medicine is retarded, as vital negative results are held back from those who could use them. this affects everyone, but it is especially egregious in the world of ‘orphan diseases’, medical problems that affect only small numbers of patients, because these corners of medicine are already short of resources, and are neglected by the research departments of most drug companies, since the opportunities for revenue are thinner. people working on orphan diseases will often research existing drugs that have been tried and failed in other conditions, but that have theoretical potential for the orphan disease. if the data from earlier work on these drugs in other diseases is missing, then the job of researching them for the orphan disease is both harder and more dangerous: perhaps they have already been shown to have benefits or effects that would help accelerate research; perhaps they have already been shown to be actively harmful when used on other diseases, and there are important safety signals that would help protect future research participants from harm. nobody can tell you.  finally, and perhaps most shamefully, when we allow unflattering data to go unpublished, we betray the patients who participated in these studies: the people who have given their bodies, and sometimes their lives, in the implicit belief that they are doing something to create new knowledge, that will benefit others in the same position as them in the future. in fact, their belief is not implicit: often it’s exactly what we tell them, as researchers, and it is a lie, because the data might be withheld, and we know it.  so whose fault is this?  why do negative trials disappear?  in a moment we will see more clear cases of drug companies withholding data – in stories where we can identify individuals – sometimes with the assistance of regulators. when we get to these, i hope your rage might swell. but first, it’s worth taking a moment to recognise that publication bias occurs outside commercial drug development, and in completely unrelated fields of academia, where people are motivated only by reputation, and their own personal interests.  in many respects, after all, publication bias is a very human process. if you’ve done a study and it didn’t have an exciting, positive result, then you might wrongly conclude that your experiment isn’t very interesting to other researchers. there’s also the issue of incentives: academics are often measured, rather unhelpfully, by crude metrics like the numbers of citations for their papers, and the number of ‘high-impact’ studies they get into glamorous well-read journals. if negative findings are harder to publish in bigger journals, and less likely to be cited by other academics, then the incentives to work at disseminating them are lower. with a positive finding, meanwhile, you get a sense of discovering something new. everyone around you is excited, because your results are exceptional.  one clear illustration of this problem came in 2010. a mainstream american psychology researcher called daryl bem published a competent academic paper, in a well-respected journal, showing evidence of precognition, the ability to see into the future.fn1 these studies were well-designed, and the findings were statistically significant, but many people weren’t very convinced, for the same reasons you aren’t: if humans really could see into the future, we’d probably know about it already; and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, rather than one-off findings.  but in fact the study has been replicated, though bem’s positive results have not been. at least two groups of academics have rerun several of bem’s experiments, using the exact same methods, and both found no evidence of precognition. one group submitted their negative results to the journal of personality and social psychology, – the very same journal that published bem’s paper in 2010 – and that journal rejected their paper out of hand. the editor even came right out and said it: we never publish studies that replicate other work.  here we see the same problem as in medicine: positive findings are more likely to be published than negative ones. every now and then, a freak positive result is published showing, for example, that people can see into the future. who knows how many psychologists have tried, over the years, to find evidence of psychic powers, running elaborate, time-consuming experiments, on dozens of subjects – maybe hundreds – and then found no evidence that such powers exist? any scientist trying to publish such a ‘so what?’ finding would struggle to get a journal to take it seriously, at the best of times. even with the clear target of bem’s paper on precognition, which was widely covered in serious newspapers across europe and the usa, the academic journal with a proven recent interest in the question of precognition simply refused to publish a paper with a negative result. yet replicating these findings was key – bem himself said so in his paper – so keeping track of the negative replications is vital too.  people working in real labs will tell you that sometimes an experiment can fail to produce a positive result many times before the outcome you’re hoping for appears. what does that mean? sometimes the failures will be the result of legitimate technical problems; but sometimes they will be vitally important statistical context, perhaps even calling the main finding of the research into question. many research findings, remember, are not absolute black-and-white outcomes, but fragile statistical correlations. under our current system, most of this contextual information about failure is just brushed under the carpet, and this has huge ramifications for the cost of replicating research, in ways that are not immediately obvious. for example, researchers failing to replicate an initial finding may not know if they’ve failed because the original result was an overstated fluke, or because they’ve made some kind of mistake in their methods. in fact, the cost of proving that a finding was wrong is vastly greater than the cost of making it in the first place, because you need to run the experiment many more times to prove the absence of a finding, simply because of the way that the statistics of detecting weak effects work; and you also need to be absolutely certain that you’ve excluded all technical problems, to avoid getting egg on your face if your replication turns out to have been inadequate. these barriers to refutation may partly explain why it’s so easy to get away with publishing findings that ultimately turn out to be wrong.31  publication bias is not just a problem in the more abstract corners of psychology research. in 2012 a group of researchers reported in the journal nature how they tried to replicate fifty-three early laboratory studies of promising targets for cancer treatments: forty-seven of the fifty-three could not be replicated.32 this study has serious implications for the development of new drugs in medicine, because such unreplicable findings are not simply an abstract academic issue: researchers build theories on the back of them, trust that they’re valid, and investigate the same idea using other methods. if they are simply being led down the garden path, chasing up fluke errors, then huge amounts of research money and effort are being wasted, and the discovery of new medical treatments is being seriously retarded.  the authors of the study were clear on both the cause of and the solution for this problem. fluke findings, they explained, are often more likely to be submitted to journals – and more likely to be published – than boring, negative ones. we should give more incentives to academics for publishing negative results; but we should also give them more opportunity.  this means changing the behaviour of academic journals, and here we are faced with a problem. although they are usually academics themselves, journal editors have their own interests and agendas, and have more in common with everyday journalists and newspaper editors than some of them might wish to admit, as the episode of the precognition experiment above illustrates very clearly. whether journals like this are a sensible model for communicating research at all is a hotly debated subject in academia, but this is the current situation. journals are the gatekeepers, they make decisions on what’s relevant and interesting for their audience, and they compete for readers.  this can lead them to behave in ways that don’t reflect the best interests of science, because an individual journal’s desire to provide colourful content might conflict with the collective need to provide a comprehensive picture of the evidence. in newspaper journalism, there is a well-known aphorism: ‘when a dog bites a man, that’s not news; but when a man bites a dog …’ these judgements on newsworthiness in mainstream media have even been demonstrated quantitatively. one study in 2003, for example, looked at the bbc’s health news coverage over several months, and calculated how many people had to die from a given cause for one story to appear. 8,571 people died from smoking for each story about smoking; but there were three stories for every death from new variant cjd, or ‘mad cow disease’.33 another, in 1992, looked at print-media coverage of drug deaths, and found that you needed 265 deaths from paracetamol poisoning for one story about such a death to appear in a paper; but every death from mdma received, on average, one piece of news coverage.34  if similar judgements are influencing the content of academic journals, then we have a problem. but can it really be the case that academic journals are the bottleneck, preventing doctors and academics from having access to unflattering trial results about the safety and effectiveness of the drugs they use? this argument is commonly deployed by industry, and researchers too are often keen to blame journals for rejecting negative findings en masse. luckily, this has been the subject of some research; and overall, while journals aren’t blameless, it’s hard to claim that they are the main source of this serious public-health problem. this is especially so since there are whole academic journals dedicated to publishing clinical trials, with a commitment to publishing negative results written into their constitutions.  but to be kind, for the sake of completeness, and because industry and researchers are so keen to pass the blame on to academic journals, we can see if what they claim is true.  one survey simply asked the authors of unpublished work if they had ever submitted it for publication. one hundred and twenty-four unpublished results were identified, by following up on every study approved by a group of us ethics committees, and when the researchers contacted the teams behind the unpublished results, it turned out that only six papers had ever actually been submitted and rejected.35 perhaps, you might say, this was a freak finding. another approach is to follow up all the papers submitted to one journal, and see if those with negative results are rejected more often. where this has been tried, the journals seem blameless: 745 manuscripts submitted to the journal of the american medical association (jama) were followed up, and there was no difference in acceptance rate for significant and non-significant findings.36 the same thing has been tried with papers submitted to the bmj, the lancet, annals of internal medicine and the journal of bone and joint surgery.37 again and again, no effect was found. some have argued that this might still represent evidence of editorial bias, if academics know that manuscripts with negative results have to be of higher quality before submission, to get past editors’ prejudices. it’s also possible that the journals played fair when they knew they were being watched, although turning around an entire publishing operation for one brief performance would be tough.  these studies all involved observing what has happened in normal practice. one last option is to run an experiment, sending identical papers to various journals, but changing the direction of the results at random, to see if that makes any difference to the acceptance rates. this isn’t something you’d want to do very often, because it wastes a lot of people’s time; but since publication bias matters, it has been regarded as a justifiable intrusion on a few occasions.  in 1990 a researcher called epstein created a series of fictitious papers, with identical methods and presentation, differing only in whether they reported positive or negative results. he sent them at random to 146 social-work journals: the positive papers were accepted 35 per cent of the time, and the negative ones 26 per cent of the time, a difference that wasn’t large enough to be statistically significant.38  other studies have tried something similar on a smaller scale, not submitting a paper to a journal, but rather, with the assistance of the journal, sending spoof academic papers to individual peer reviewers: these people do not make the final decision on publication, but they do give advice to editors, so a window into their behaviour would be useful. these studies have had more mixed results. in one from 1977, sham papers with identical methods but different results were sent to seventy-five reviewers. some bias was found from reviewers against findings that disagreed with their own views.39  another study, from 1994, looked at reviewers’ responses to a paper on tens machines: these are fairly controversial devices sold for pain relief. thirty-three reviewers with strong views one way or the other were identified, and again it was found that their judgements on the paper were broadly correlated with their pre-existing views, though the study was small.40 another paper did the same thing with papers on quack treatments; it found that the direction of findings had no effect on reviewers from mainstream medical journals deciding whether to accept them.41  one final randomised trial from 2010 tried on a grand scale to see if reviewers really do reject ideas based on their pre-existing beliefs (a good indicator of whether journals are biased by results, when they should be focused simply on whether a study is properly designed and conducted). fabricated papers were sent to over two hundred reviewers, and they were all identical, except for the results they reported: half of the reviewers got results they would like, half got results they wouldn’t. reviewers were more likely to recommend publication if they received the version of the manuscript with results they’d like (97 per cent vs 80 per cent), more likely to detect errors in a manuscript whose results they didn’t like, and rated the methods more highly in papers whose results they liked.42  overall, though, even if there are clearly rough edges in some domains, these results don’t suggest that the journals are the main cause of the problem of the disappearance of negative trials. in the experiments isolating the peer reviewers, those individual referees were biased in some studies, but they don’t have the last word on publication, and in all the studies which look at what happens to negative papers submitted to journals in the real world, the evidence suggests that they proceed into print without problems. journals may not be entirely innocent – the trouble with medical journals by richard smith, previously editor of the bmj, is an excellent overview of their faults;43 and we will see later how they fail to police important and simple flaws in studies. but it would be wrong to lay the blame for publication bias entirely at their door.  in the light of all this, the data on what researchers say about their own behaviour is very revealing. in various surveys they have said that they thought there was no point in submitting negative results, because they would just be rejected by journals: 20 per cent of medical researchers said so in 1998;44 61 per cent of psychology and education researchers said so in 1991;45 and so on.46 if asked why they’ve failed to send in research for publication, the most common reasons researchers give are negative results, a lack of interest, or a lack of time.  this is the more abstract end of academia – largely away from the immediate world of clinical trials – but it seems that academics are mistaken, at best, about the reasons why negative results go missing. journals may pose some barriers to publishing negative results, but they are hardly absolute, and much of the problem lies in academics’ motivations and perceptions.  more than that, in recent years, the era of open-access academic journals has got going in earnest: there are now several, such as trials, which are free to access, and have a core editorial policy that they will accept any trial report, regardless of result, and will actively solicit negative findings. trials registers like clinicaltrials.gov will also post results. with offers like this on the table, it is very hard to believe that anyone would really struggle to disseminate the findings of a trial with a negative result if they wanted to. and yet, despite this, negative results continue to go missing, with vast multinational companies simply withholding results on their drugs, even though academics and doctors are desperate to see them.  you might reasonably wonder whether there are people who are supposed to prevent this kind of data from being withheld. the universities where research takes place, for example; or the regulators; or the ‘ethics committees’, which are charged with protecting patients who participate in research. unfortunately, our story is about to take a turn to the dark side. we will see that many of the very people and organisations we would have expected to protect patients from the harm inflicted by missing data have, instead, shirked their responsibilities; and worse than that, we will see that many of them have actively conspired in helping companies to withhold data from patients. we are about to hit some big problems, some bad people, and some simple solutions.  how ethics committees and universities have failed us  by now, you will, i hope, share my view that withholding results from clinical trials is unethical, for the simple reason that hidden data exposes patients to unnecessary and avoidable harm. but the ethical transgressions here go beyond the simple harm inflicted on future patients.  patients and the public participate in clinical trials at some considerable cost to themselves: they expose themselves to hassle and intrusion, because clinical trials almost always require that you have more check-ups on your progress, more blood tests, and more examinations; but participants may also expose themselves to more risk, or the chance of receiving an inferior treatment. people do this out of altruism, on the implicit understanding that the results from their experience will contribute to improving our knowledge of what works and what doesn’t, and so will help other patients in the future. in fact, this understanding isn’t just implicit: in many trials it’s explicit, because patients are specifically told when they sign up to participate that the data will be used to inform future decisions. if this isn’t true, and the data can be withheld at the whim of a researcher or a company, then the patients have been actively lied to. that is very bad news.  so what are the formal arrangements between patients, researchers and sponsors? in any sensible world, we’d expect universal contracts, making it clear that all researchers are obliged to publish their results, and that industry sponsors – which have a huge interest in positive results – must have no control over the data. but despite everything we know about industry-funded research being systematically biased, this does not happen. in fact, quite the opposite is true: it is entirely normal for researchers and academics conducting industry-funded trials to sign contracts subjecting them to gagging clauses which forbid them to publish, discuss or analyse data from the trials they have conducted, without the permission of the funder. this is such a secretive and shameful situation that even trying to document it in public can be a fraught business, as we shall now see.  in 2006 a paper was published in jama describing how common it was for researchers doing industry-funded trials to have these kinds of constraints placed on their right to publish the results.47 the study was conducted by the nordic cochrane centre, and it looked at all the trials given approval to go ahead in copenhagen and frederiksberg. (if you’re wondering why these two cities were chosen, it was simply a matter of practicality, and the bizarre secrecy that shrouds this world: the researchers applied elsewhere without success, and were specifically refused access to data in the uk.48) these trials were overwhelmingly sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry (98 per cent), and the rules governing the management of the results tell a story which walks the now-familiar line between frightening and absurd.  for sixteen of the forty-four trials the sponsoring company got to see the data as it accumulated, and in a further sixteen they had the right to stop the trial at any time, for any reason. this means that a company can see if a trial is going against it, and can interfere as it progresses. as we will see later (early stopping, breaking protocols, pp.186, 202), this distorts a trial’s results with unnecessary and hidden biases. for example, if you stop a trial early because you have been peeking at the preliminary results, then you can either exaggerate a modest benefit, or bury a worsening negative result. crucially, the fact that the sponsoring company had this opportunity to introduce bias wasn’t mentioned in any of the published academic papers reporting the results of these trials, so nobody reading the literature could possibly know that these studies were subject – by design – to such an important flaw.  even if the study was allowed to finish, the data could still be suppressed. there were constraints on publication rights in forty of the forty-four trials, and in half of them the contracts specifically stated that the sponsor either owned the data outright (what about the patients, you might say?), or needed to approve the final publication, or both. none of these restrictions was mentioned in any of the published papers, and in fact, none of the protocols or papers said that the sponsor had full access to all the data from the trial, or the final say on whether to publish.  it’s worth taking a moment to think about what this means. the results of all these trials were subject to a bias that will significantly distort the academic literature, because trials that show early signs of producing a negative result (or trials that do produce a negative result) can be deleted from the academic record; but nobody reading these trials could possibly have known that this opportunity for censorship existed.  the paper i’ve just described was published in jama, one of the biggest medical journals in the world. shortly afterwards, a shocking tale of industry interference appeared in the bmj.49 lif, the danish pharmaceutical industry association, responded to the paper by announcing in the journal of the danish medical association that it was ‘both shaken and enraged about the criticism, that could not be recognised’. it demanded an investigation of the scientists, though it failed to say by whom, or of what. then lif wrote to the danish committee on scientific dishonesty, accusing the cochrane researchers of scientific misconduct. we can’t see the letter, but the cochrane researchers say the allegations were extremely serious – they were accused of deliberately distorting the data – but vague, and without documents or evidence to back them up.  nonetheless, the investigation went on for a year, because in academia people like to do things properly, and assume that all complaints are made in good faith. peter gøtzsche, the director of the cochrane centre, told the bmj that only lif’s third letter, ten months into this process, made specific allegations that could be investigated by the committee. two months later the charges were dismissed. the cochrane researchers had done nothing wrong. but before they were cleared, lif copied the letters alleging scientific dishonesty to the hospital where four of them worked, and to the management organisation running that hospital, and sent similar letters to the danish medical association, the ministry of health, the ministry of science, and so on. gøtzsche and his colleagues said that they felt ‘intimidated and harassed’ by lif’s behaviour. lif continued to insist that the researchers were guilty of misconduct even after the investigation was completed. so, researching in this area is not easy: it’s hard to get funding, and the industry will make your work feel like chewing on a mouthful of wasps.  even though the problem has been widely recognised, attempts to fix it have failed.50 the international committee of medical journal editors, for example, stood up in 2001, insisting that the lead author of any study it published must sign a document stating that the researchers had full access to the data, and full control over the decision to publish. researchers at duke university, north carolina, then surveyed the contracts between medical schools and industry sponsors, and found that this edict was flouted as a matter of routine. they recommended boilerplate contracts for the relationship between industry and academia. was this imposed? no. sponsors continue to control the data.  half a decade later, a major study in the new england journal of medicine investigated whether anything had changed.51 administrators at all 122 accredited medical schools in the us were asked about their contracts (to be clear, this wasn’t a study of what they did; rather it was a study of what they were willing to say in public). the majority said contract negotiations over the right to publish data were ‘difficult’. a worrying 62 per cent said it was ok for the clinical trial agreement between academics and industry sponsor to be confidential. this is a serious problem, as it means that anyone reading a study cannot know how much interference was available to the sponsor, which is important context for the person reading and interpreting the research. half of the centres allowed the sponsor to draft the research paper, which is another interesting hidden problem in medicine, as biases and emphases can be quietly introduced (as we shall see in more detail in chapter 6). half said it was ok for contracts to forbid researchers sharing data after the research was completed and published, once again hindering research. a quarter said it was acceptable for the sponsor to insert its own statistical analyses into the manuscript. asked about disputes, 17 per cent of administrators had seen an argument about who had control of data in the preceding year.  sometimes, disputes over access to such data can cause serious problems in academic departments, when there is a divergence of views on what is ethical. aubrey blumsohn was a senior lecturer at sheffield university, working on a project funded by procter & gamble to research an osteoporosis drug called risedronate.52 the aim was to analyse blood and urine samples from an earlier trial, led by blumsohn’s head of department, professor richard eastell. after signing the contracts, p&g sent over some ‘abstracts’, brief summaries of the findings, with blumsohn’s name as first author, and some summary results tables. that’s great, said blumsohn, but i’m the researcher here: i’d like to see the actual raw data and analyse it myself. the company declined, saying that this was not their policy. blumsohn stood his ground, and the papers were left unpublished. then, however, blumsohn saw that eastell had published another paper with p&g, stating that all the researchers had ‘had full access to the data and analyses’. he complained, knowing this was not true. blumsohn was suspended by sheffield university, which offered him a gagging clause and £145,000, and he was eventually forced out of his job. eastell, meanwhile, was censured by the general medical council, but only after a staggering delay of several years, and he remains in post.  so contracts that permit companies and researchers to withhold or control data are common, and they’re bad news. but that’s not just because they lead to doctors and patients being misled about what works. they also break another vitally important contract: the agreement between researchers and the patients who participate in their trials.  people participate in trials believing that the results of that research will help to improve the treatment of patients like them in the future. this isn’t just speculation: one of the few studies to ask patients why they have participated in a trial found that 90 per cent believed they were making a ‘major’ or ‘moderate’ contribution to society, and 84 per cent felt proud that they were making this contribution.53 patients are not stupid or naïve to believe this, because it is what they are told on the consent forms they sign before participating in trials. but they are mistaken, because the results of trials are frequently left unpublished, and withheld from doctors and patients. these signed consent forms therefore mislead people on two vitally important points. firstly, they fail to tell the truth: that the person conducting the trial, or the person paying for it, may decide not to publish the results, depending on how they look at the end of the study. and worse than that, they also explicitly state a falsehood: researchers tell patients that they are participating in order to create knowledge that will be used to improve treatment in future, even though the researchers know that in many cases, those results will never be published.  there is only one conclusion that we can draw from this: consent forms routinely lie to patients participating in trials. this is an extraordinary state of affairs, made all the more extraordinary by the huge amounts of red tape that everyone involved in a trial must negotiate, closely monitoring endless arcane pieces of paperwork, and ensuring that patients are fully informed on the minutiae of their treatment. despite all this regulatory theatre, which hinders good research on routine practice (as we shall see – p.232), we allow these forms to tell patients outright lies about the control of data, and we fail to police one of the most important ethical problems in the whole of medicine. the deceit of these consent forms is, to me, a good illustration of how broken and outdated the regulatory frameworks of medicine have become. but it also, finally, poses a serious problem for the future of research.  we desperately need patients to continue to believe that they are contributing to society, because trial recruitment is in crisis, and it is increasingly hard to persuade patients to participate at all. in one recent study, a third of all trials failed to reach their original recruitment target, and more than half had to be awarded an extension.54 if word gets out that trials are often more promotional than genuinely scientific, recruitment will become even more difficult. the answer is not to hide this problem, but rather to fix it.  so universities and ethics committees may have failed us, but there is one group of people we might expect to step up, to try to show some leadership on missing trial data. these are the medical and academic professional bodies, the royal colleges of general practice, surgery and physicians, the general medical council, the british medical association, the pharmacists’ organisations, the bodies representing each sub-specialty of academia, the respiratory physiologists, the pharmacologists, the academy of medical sciences, and so on.  these organisations have the opportunity to set the tone of academic and clinical medicine, in their codes of conduct, their aspirations, and in some cases their rules, since some have the ability to impose sanctions, and all have the ability to exclude those who fail to meet basic ethical standards. we have established, i hope, beyond any doubt, that non-publication of trials in humans is research misconduct, that it misleads doctors and harms patients around the world. have these organisations used their powers, stood up and announced, prominently and fiercely, that this must stop, and that they will take action?  one has: the faculty of pharmaceutical medicine, a small organisation of doctors – largely working in the industry – with 1,400 members. and none of the others have bothered.  not one.  what can be done?  there are several simple solutions to these problems, which fall into three categories. there is no argument against any of the following suggestions that i am aware of. the issue of missing data has been neglected through institutional inertia, and reluctance by senior academics to challenge industry. their failure to act harms patients every day.  gagging clauses  if there is nothing to be ashamed of in gagging clauses – if companies, and legislators, and academics, and university contracts departments, all believe that they are acceptable – then everything should be out in the open, prominently flagged up, so that everyone outside those systems can decide if they agree.     1. until they can be eradicated, where gagging clauses exist,      patients should be told, at the time they are invited to      participate in a trial, that the company sponsoring it is allowed      to hide the results if it doesn’t like them. the consent form      should also explain clearly that withholding negative results      will lead to doctors and patients being misled about the      effectiveness of the treatment being trialled, and so exposed      to unnecessary harm. trial participants can then decide for      themselves if they think these contracts are acceptable.     2. wherever the sponsoring company has the contractual right      to gag publication, even if it doesn’t exercise that right, the      fact that a gagging clause existed should be stated clearly:      in the academic paper; in the trial protocol; and in the publicly      available trial registry entry that goes up before the trial      starts. readers of the trial findings can then decide for      themselves if they trust that sponsor and research group to      publish all negative findings, and interpret any reported      positive findings in that light.     3. all university contracts should follow the same boilerplate      format, and forbid gagging clauses. failing that, all universities      should be forced to prominently declare which contracts      with gagging clauses they have permitted, and to publish those      clauses online for all to see, so that all can be alerted that the      institution is producing systematically biased research, and      discount any findings from them accordingly.     4. in legislation, gagging clauses should be made illegal, with no      possibility of quibbles. if there is a dispute about analysis or      interpretation between the people running the trial and the      people paying for it, it should take place in the published      academic literature, or some other public forum. not in secret.  professional bodies     1. all professional bodies should take a clear stand on      unpublished trial data, declare it clearly as research      misconduct, and state that it will be handled like any other      form of serious misconduct that misleads doctors and harms      patients.that they have not done so is a stain on the reputation      of these organisations, and on their senior members.     2. all research staff involved in any trial on humans should be      regarded as jointly and severally liable for ensuring that it is      published in full within one year of completion.     3.all those responsible for withholding trial data should have      their names prominently posted in a single database, so      that others can be made aware of the risk of working with      them, or allowing them access to patients for research, in      future.  ethics committees     1.no person should be allowed to conduct trials in humans if a      research project they are responsible for is currently      withholding trial data from publication more than one year      after completion. where any researcher on a project has a      previous track record of delayed publication of trial data, the      ethics committee should be notified, and this should be taken      into account, as with any researcher guilty of research      misconduct.     2.no trial should be approved without a firm guarantee of      publication within one year of completion.  how regulators and journals have failed us  so far we’ve established that ethics committees, universities and the professional bodies of medical researchers have all failed to protect patients from publication bias, even though the selective non-publication of unflattering data is a serious issue for medicine. we know that it distorts and undermines every decision that researchers, doctors and patients make, and that it exposes patients to avoidable suffering and death. this is not seriously disputed, so you might reasonably imagine that governments, regulators and medical journals must all have tried to address it.  they have tried, and failed. worse than simply failing, they have repeatedly provided what we might regard as ‘fake fixes’: we have seen small changes in regulations and practices, announced with great fanfare, but then either ignored or bypassed. this has given false reassurance to doctors, academics and the public that the problem has been fixed. what follows is the story of these fake fixes.  registers  the earliest and simplest solution proposed was to open registers of trials: if people are compelled to publish their protocol, in full, before they start work, then we at least have the opportunity to go back and check to see if they’ve published the trials that they’ve conducted. this is very useful, for a number of reasons. a trial protocol describes in great technical detail everything that researchers will do in a trial: how many patients they’ll recruit, where they’ll come from, how they’ll be divided up, what treatment each group will get, and what outcome will be measured to establish if the treatment was successful. because of this, it can be used to check whether a trial was published, but also whether its methods were distorted along the way, in a manner that would allow the results to be exaggerated (as described in chapter 4).  the first major paper to call for a registry of clinical trial protocols was published in 1986,55 and it was followed by a flood. in 1990 iain chalmers (we can call him sir iain chalmers if you likefn2) published a classic paper called ‘underreporting research is scientific misconduct’,57 and he has traced the chequered history of trials registers in the uk.58 in 1992, as the cochrane collaboration began to gather influence, representatives of the association of the british pharmaceutical industry (abpi) asked to meet chalmers.59 after explaining the work of cochrane, and the vital importance of summarising all the trial results on a particular drug, he explained very clearly to them how biased under-reporting of results harms patients.  the industry’s representatives were moved, and soon they took action. mike wallace, the chief executive of schering and a member of that abpi delegation, agreed with chalmers that withholding data was ethically and scientifically indefensible, and said that he planned to do something concrete to prevent it, if only to protect the industry from having the issue forced upon it in less welcome terms. wallace stepped out of line from his colleagues, and committed to registering every trial conducted by his company with cochrane. this was not a popular move, and he was reprimanded by colleagues, in particular those from other companies.  but then glaxowellcome followed suit, and in 1998 its chief executive, richard sykes, wrote an editorial in the bmj called ‘being a modern pharmaceutical company involves making information available on clinical trial programmes’.60 ‘programmes’ was the crucial word, because as we’ve seen, and as we shall see in greater detail later, you can only make sense of individual findings if you assess them in the context of all the work that has been done on a drug.  glaxowellcome set up a clinical trials registry, and elizabeth wager, the head of the company’s medical writers group, pulled together a group from across the industry to develop ethical guidelines for presenting research. the abpi, seeing individual companies take the lead, saw the writing on the wall: it decided to commend glaxowellcome’s policy to the whole industry, and launched this initiative at a press conference where chalmers – a strong critic – sat on the same side of the table as the industry. astrazeneca, aventis, msd, novartis, roche, schering healthcare and wyeth began registering some of their trials – only the ones involving uk patients, and retrospectively – but there was movement at last.  at the same time, there was movement in america. the 1997 fda modernization act created clinicaltrials.gov, a register run by the us government national institutes of health. this legislation required that trials should be registered, but only if they related to an application to put a new drug on the market, and even then, only if it was for a serious or life-threatening disease. the register opened in 1998, and the website clinicaltrials.gov went online in 2000. the entry criteria were widened in 2004.  but soon it all began to fall apart. glaxowellcome merged with smithkline beecham to become glaxosmithkline (gsk), and initially the new logo appeared on the old trials register. iain chalmers wrote to jean-paul garnier, the chief executive of the new company, to thank him for maintaining this valuable transparency: but no reply ever came. the registry website was closed, and the contents were lost (though gsk was later forced to open a new register, as part of a settlement with the us government over the harm caused by its withholding of data on new drug trials just a couple of years later). elizabeth wager, the author of the good publication practice guidelines for drug companies, was out of a job, as her writing department at gsk was closed. her guidelines were ignored.61  from the moment that these registries were first suggested, and then opened, it was implicitly assumed that the shame of producing this public record, and then not publishing your study, would be enough to ensure that people would do the right thing. but the first problem for the us register, which could have been used universally, was that people simply chose not to use it. the regulations required only a very narrow range of trials to be posted, and nobody else was in a hurry to post their trials if they didn’t have to.  in 2004 the international committee of medical journal editors (icmje) – a collection of editors from the most influential journals in the world – published a policy statement, announcing that none of them would publish any clinical trials after 2005, unless they had been properly registered before they began.62 they did this, essentially, to force the hand of the industry and researchers: if a trial has a positive result, then people desperately want to publish it in the most prestigious journal they can find. although they had no legal force, the journal editors did have the thing that companies and researchers wanted most: the chance of a major journal publication. by insisting on pre-registration, they were doing what they could to force researchers and industry sponsors to register all trials. everyone rejoiced: the problem had been fixed.  if you think it seems odd – and perhaps unrealistic – that fixing this crucial flaw in the information architecture of a $700 billion industry should be left to an informal gathering of a few academic editors, with no legislative power, then you’d be right. although everybody began to talk as if publication bias was a thing of the past, in reality it was continuing just as before, because the journal editors simply ignored their own threats and promises. later (pp.247, 307) we will see the phenomenal financial inducements on offer to editors for publishing positive industry papers, which can extend to millions of dollars in reprint and advertising revenue. but first we should look at what they actually did after their solemn promise in 2005.  in 2008 a group of researchers went through every single trial published in the top ten medical journals, every one of which was a member of the icmje, after the deadline for pre-registration. out of 323 trials published during 2008 in these high-impact academic journals, only half were adequately registered (before the trial, with the main outcome measure properly specified), and trial registration was entirely lacking for over a quarter.63 the icmje editors had simply failed to keep their word.  meanwhile, in europe, there were some very bizarre developments. with enormous fanfare, the european medicines agency created a registry of trials called eudract. eu legislation requires all trials to be posted here if they involve any patients in europe, and many companies will tell you that they’ve met their responsibilities for transparency by doing so. but the contents of this eu register have been kept entirely secret. i can tell you that it contains around 30,000 trials, since that figure is in the public domain, but that is literally all i know, and all anyone can know. despite eu legislation requiring that the public should be given access to the contents of this register, it remains closed. this creates an almost laughable paradox: the eu clinical trials register is a transparency tool, held entirely in secret. since march 2011, after heavy media criticism (from me at any rate), a subset of trials has slowly been made public through a website called eudrapharm. as of summer 2012, although the agency now claims that its register is accessible to all, at least 10,000 trials are still missing, and the search engine doesn’t work properly.64 it’s absolutely one of the strangest things i’ve ever seen, and nobody other than the eu even regards this peculiar exercise as a trials register: i certainly don’t, i doubt you do, and both the icmje and the world health organization have explicitly stated that eudract is not a meaningful register.  but new work was being done in the us, and it seemed sensible. in 2007 the fda amendment act was passed. this is much tighter: it requires registration of all trials of any drug or device, at any stage of development other than ‘first-in-man’ tests, if they have any site in the us, or involve any kind of application to bring a new drug onto the market. it also imposes a startling new requirement: all results of all trials must be posted to clinicaltrials.gov, in abbreviated summary tables, within one year of completion, for any trial on any marketed drug that completes after 2007.  once again, to great fanfare, everyone believed that the problem had been fixed. but it hasn’t been, for two very important reasons.  firstly, unfortunately, despite the undoubted goodwill, requiring the publication of all trials starting from ‘now’ does absolutely nothing for medicine today. there is no imaginable clinic, anywhere in the world, at which medicine is practised only on the basis of trials that completed within the past three years, using only drugs that came to market since 2008. in fact, quite the opposite is true: the vast majority of drugs currently in use came to market over the past ten, twenty or thirty years, and one of the great challenges for the pharmaceutical industry today is to create drugs that are anything like as innovative as those that were introduced in what has come to be known as the ‘golden era’ of pharmaceutical research, when all the most widely used drugs, for all the most common diseases, were developed. perhaps they were the ‘low-lying fruit’, plucked from the research tree, but in any case, these are the tablets we use.  and crucially, it is for these drugs – the ones we actually use – that we need the evidence: from trials completed in 2005 or 1995. these are the drugs that we are prescribing completely blind, misled by a biased sample of trials, selectively published, with the unflattering data buried in secure underground data archives somewhere in the hills (i am told) of cheshire.  but there is a second, more disturbing reason why these regulations should be taken with a pinch of salt: they have been widely ignored. a study published in january 2012 looked at the first slice of trials subject to mandatory reporting, and found that only one in five had met its obligation to post results.65 perhaps this is not surprising: the fine for non-compliance is $10,000 a day, which sounds spectacular, until you realise that it’s only $3.5 million a year, which is chickenfeed for a drug bringing in $4 billion a year. and what’s more, no such fine has ever been levied, throughout the entire history of the legislation.  so that, in total, is why i regard the icmje, the fda and the eu’s claims to have addressed this problem as ‘fake fixes’. in fact, they have done worse than fail: they have given false reassurance that the problem has been fixed, false reassurance that it has gone away, and they have led us to take our eyes off the ball. for half a decade now, people in medicine and academia have talked about publication bias as if it was yesterday’s problem, discovered in the 1990s and early 2000s, and swiftly fixed.  but the problem of missing data has not gone away, and soon we will see exactly how shameless some companies and regulators can be, in the very present day.  what can be done?  the icmje should keep its promises, the eu should be less risible, and the fda amendment act 2007 should be muscularly enforced. but there are many more disappointments to come, so i will leave my action plan on missing data for later in this chapter.  blood from a stone: trying to get data from regulators  so far we’ve established that doctors and patients have been failed by a range of different people and organisations, all of whom we might have expected to step up and fix the problem of missing data, since it harms patients in large numbers around the world. we have seen that governments take no action against those who fail to publish their results, despite the public pretence to the contrary; and that they take no action against those who fail to register their trials. we have seen that medical journal editors continue to publish unregistered trials, despite the public pretence that they have taken a stand. we have seen that ethics committees fail to insist on universal publication, despite their stated aim of protecting patients. and we have seen that professional bodies fail to take action against what is obviously research misconduct, despite evidence showing that the problem of missing data is of epidemic proportions.66  while the published academic record is hopelessly distorted, you might hope that there is one final route which patients and doctors could use to get access to the results of clinical trials: the regulators, which receive large amounts of data from drug companies during the approval process, must surely have obligations to protect patients’ safety? but this, sadly, is just one more example of how we are failed by the very bodies that are supposed to be protecting us.  in this section, we will see three key failures. firstly, the regulators may not have the information in the first place. secondly, the way in which they ‘share’ summary trial information with doctors and patients is broken and shabby. and finally, if you try to get all of the information that a drug company has provided – the long-form documents, where the bodies are often buried – then regulators present bizarre barriers, blocking and obfuscating for several years at a time, even on drugs that turn out to be ineffective and harmful. nothing of what i am about to tell you is in any sense reassuring.  one: information is withheld from regulators  paroxetine is a commonly used antidepressant, from the class of drugs known as ‘selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors’, or ssris. you will hear more about this class of drugs later in this book, but here we will use paroxetine to show how companies have exploited our longstanding permissiveness about missing trials, and found loopholes in our inadequate regulations on trial disclosure. we will see that gsk withheld data about whether paroxetine works as an antidepressant, and even withheld data about its harmful side effects, but most importantly, we will see that what it did was all entirely legal.  to understand why, we first need to go through a quirk of the licensing process. drugs do not simply come onto the market for use in all medical conditions: for any specific use of any drug, in any specific disease, you need a separate marketing authorisation. so, a drug might be licensed to treat ovarian cancer, for example, but not breast cancer. that doesn’t mean the drug doesn’t work in breast cancer. there might well be some evidence that it’s great for treating that disease too, but maybe the company hasn’t gone to the trouble and expense of getting a formal marketing authorisation for that specific use. doctors can still go ahead and prescribe it for breast cancer, if they want, because the drug is available for prescription, and there are boxes of it sitting in pharmacies waiting to go out (even though, strictly speaking, it’s only got marketing approval for use in ovarian cancer). in this situation the doctor will be prescribing the drug legally, but ‘off-label’.  this is fairly common, as getting a marketing authorisation for a specific use can be time-consuming and expensive. if doctors know that there’s a drug which has been shown in good-quality trials to help treat a disease, it would be perverse and unhelpful of them not to prescribe it, just because the company hasn’t applied for a formal licence to market it for that specific use. i’ll discuss the ins and outs of all this in more detail later. but for now, what you need to know is that the use of a drug in children is treated as a separate marketing authorisation from its use in adults.  this makes sense in many cases, because children can respond to drugs in very different ways to adults, so the risks and benefits might be very different, and research needs to be done in children separately. but this licensing quirk also brings some disadvantages. getting a licence for a specific use is an arduous business, requiring lots of paperwork, and some specific studies. often this will be so expensive that companies will not bother to get a licence specifically to market a drug for use in children, because that market is usually much smaller.  but once a drug is available in a country for one specific thing, as we have seen, it can then be prescribed for absolutely anything. so it is not unusual for a drug to be licensed for use in adults, but then prescribed for children on the back of a hunch; or a judgement that it should at least do no harm; or studies that suggest benefit in children, but that would probably be insufficient to get through the specific formal process of getting marketing authorisation for use in kids; or even good studies, but in a disease where the market is so small that the company can’t be bothered to get a marketing approval for use in children.  regulators have recognised that there is a serious problem with drugs being used in children ‘off-label’, without adequate research, so recently they have started to offer incentives for companies to conduct the research, and formally seek these licences. the incentives are patent extensions, and these can be lucrative. all drugs slip into the public domain about a decade after coming onto the market, and become like paracetamol, which anyone can make very cheaply. if a company is given a six-month extension on a drug, for all uses, then it can make a lot more money from that medicine. this seems a good example of regulators being pragmatic, and thinking creatively about what carrots they can offer. licensed use in children will probably not itself make a company much extra money, since doctors are prescribing the drug for children already, even without a licence or good evidence, simply because there are no other options. meanwhile, six months of extra patent life for a blockbuster drug will be very lucrative, if its adult market is large enough.  there’s a lot of debate about whether the drug companies have played fair with these offers. for example, since the fda started offering this deal, about a hundred drugs have been given paediatric licences, but many of them were for diseases that aren’t very common in children, like stomach ulcers, or arthritis. there have been far fewer applications for less lucrative products that could be used in children, such as more modern medicines called ‘large-molecule biologics’. but there it is.  when gsk applied for a marketing authorisation in children for paroxetine, an extraordinary situation came to light, triggering the longest investigation in the history of uk drugs regulation. this investigation was published in 2008, and examined whether gsk should face criminal charges.67 it turned out that what the company had done – withholding important data about safety and effectiveness that doctors and patients clearly needed to see – was plainly unethical, and put children around the world at risk; but our laws are so weak that gsk could not be charged with any crime.  between 1994 and 2002 gsk conducted nine trials of paroxetine in children.68 the first two failed to show any benefit, but the company made no attempt to inform anyone of this by changing the ‘drug label’ that is sent to all doctors and patients. in fact, after these trials were completed, an internal company management document stated: ‘it would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine’. in the year after this secret internal memo, 32,000 prescriptions were issued to children for paroxetine in the uk alone: so, while the company knew the drug didn’t work in children, it was in no hurry to tell doctors that, despite knowing that large numbers of children were taking it. more trials were conducted over the coming years – nine in total – and none showed that the drug was effective at treating depression in children.  it gets much worse than that. these children weren’t simply receiving a drug that the company knew to be ineffective for them: they were also being exposed to side effects. this should be self-evident, since any effective treatment will have some side effects, and doctors factor this in, alongside the benefits (which in this case were non-existent). but nobody knew how bad these side effects were, because the company didn’t tell doctors, or patients, or even the regulator about the worrying safety data from its trials. this was because of a loophole (on which more in a couple of pages’ time): you only had to tell the regulator about side effects reported in studies looking at the specific uses for which the drug has a marketing authorisation. because the use of paroxetine in children was ‘off-label’, gsk had no legal obligation at the time to tell anyone about what it had found.  people had worried for a long time that paroxetine might increase the risk of suicide, though that is quite a difficult side effect to detect in an antidepressant, because people with depression are at a much higher risk of suicide than the general population anyway, as a result of their depression. there are also some grounds to believe that as patients first come out of their depression, and leave behind the sluggish lack of motivation that often accompanies profound misery, there may be a period during which they are more capable of killing themselves, just because of the depression slowly lifting.  furthermore, suicide is a mercifully rare event, which means you need a lot of people on a drug to detect an increased risk. also, suicide is not always recorded accurately on death certificates, because coroners and doctors are reluctant to give a verdict that many would regard as shameful, so the signal you are trying to detect in the data – suicide – is going to be corrupted. suicidal thoughts or behaviours that don’t result in death are more common than suicide itself, so they should be easier to detect, but they too are hard to pick up in routinely collected data, because they’re often not presented to doctors, and where they are, they can be coded in health records in all sorts of different ways, if they appear at all. because of all these difficulties, you would want to have every scrap of data you could possibly cobble together on the question of whether these drugs cause suicidal thoughts or behaviour in children; and you would want a lot of experienced people, with a wide range of skills, all looking at the data and discussing it.  in february 2003, gsk spontaneously sent the mhra a package of information on the risk of suicide on paroxetine, containing some analyses done in 2002 from adverse-event data in trials the company had held, going back a decade. this analysis showed that there was no increased risk of suicide. but it was misleading: although it was unclear at the time, data from trials in children had been mixed in with data from trials in adults, which had vastly greater numbers of participants. as a result, any sign of increased suicide risk among children on paroxetine had been completely diluted away.  later in 2003, gsk had a meeting with the mhra to discuss another issue involving paroxetine. at the end of this meeting, the gsk representatives gave out a briefing document, explaining that the company was planning to apply later that year for a specific marketing authorisation to use paroxetine in children. they mentioned, while handing out the document, that the mhra might wish to bear in mind a safety concern the company had noted: an increased risk of suicide among children with depression who received paroxetine, compared with those on dummy placebo pills.  this was vitally important side-effect data, being presented, after an astonishing delay, casually, through an entirely inappropriate and unofficial channel. gsk knew that the drug was being prescribed in children, and it knew that there were safety concerns in children, but it had chosen not to reveal that information. when it did share the data, it didn’t flag it up as a clear danger in the current use of the drug, requiring urgent attention from the relevant department in the regulator; instead it presented it as part of an informal briefing about a future application. although the data was given to completely the wrong team, the mhra staff present at this meeting had the wit to spot that this was an important new problem. a flurry of activity followed: analyses were done, and within one month a letter was sent to all doctors advising them not to prescribe paroxetine to patients under the age of eighteen.  how is it possible that our systems for getting data from companies are so poor that they can simply withhold vitally important information showing that a drug is not only ineffective, but actively dangerous? there are two sets of problems here: firstly, access for regulators; and secondly, access for doctors.  there is no doubt that the regulations contain ridiculous loopholes, and it’s dismal to see how gsk cheerfully exploited them. as i’ve mentioned, the company had no legal duty to give over the information, because prescription of the drug in children was outside of paroxetine’s formally licensed uses – even though gsk knew this was widespread. in fact, of the nine studies the company conducted, only one had its results reported to the mhra, because that was the only one conducted in the uk.  after this episode, the mhra and the eu changed some of their regulations, though not adequately, and created an obligation for companies to hand over safety data for uses of a drug outside its marketing authorisation, closing the paroxetine loophole.  this whole incident illustrates a key problem, and it is one that recurs throughout this section of the book: you need all of the data in order to see what’s happening with a drug’s benefits, and risks. some of the trials that gsk conducted were published in part, but that is obviously not enough: we already know that if we see only a biased sample of the data, we are misled. but we also need all the data for the more simple reason that we need lots of data: safety signals are often weak, subtle and difficult to detect. suicidal thoughts and plans are rare in children – even those with depression, even those on paroxetine – so all the data from a large number of participants needed to be combined before the signal was detectable in the noise. in the case of paroxetine, the dangers only became apparent when the adverse events from all of the trials were pooled and analysed together.  that leads us to the second obvious flaw in the current system: the results of these trials – the safety data and the effectiveness data – are given in secret to the regulator, which then sits and quietly makes a decision. this is a huge problem, because you need many eyes on these difficult problems. i don’t think that the people who work in the mhra are bad, or incompetent: i know a lot of them, and they are smart, good people. but we shouldn’t trust them to analyse this data alone, in the same way that we shouldn’t trust any single organisation to analyse data alone, with nobody looking over its shoulder, checking the working, providing competition, offering helpful criticism, speeding it up, and so on.  this is even worse than academics failing to share their primary research data, because at least in an academic paper you get a lot of detail about what was done, and how. the output of a regulator is often simply a crude, brief summary: almost a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ about side effects. this is the opposite of science, which is only reliable because everyone shows their working, explains how they know that something is effective or safe, shares their methods and their results, and allows others to decide if they agree with the way they processed and analysed the data.  yet for the safety and efficacy of drugs, one of the most important of all analyses done by science, we turn our back on this process completely: we allow it to happen behind closed doors, because drug companies have decided that they want to share their trial results discreetly with the regulators. so the most important job in evidence-based medicine, and a perfect example of a problem that benefits from many eyes and minds, is carried out alone and in secret.  this perverse and unhealthy secrecy extends way beyond regulators. nice, the uk’s national institute for health and clinical excellence, is charged with making recommendations about which treatments are most cost-effective, and which work best. when it does this, it’s in the same boat as you or me: it has absolutely no statutory right to see data on the safety or effectiveness of a drug, if a company doesn’t want to release it, even though the regulators have all of that data. for ‘single technology appraisals’, on one treatment, they ask the company to make available to them the information the company thinks is relevant. for ‘guidelines’ on treatment in a whole area of medicine, they are more vulnerable to what is published in journals. as a result, even nice can end up working on distorted, edited, biased samples of the data.  sometimes nice is able to access some extra unpublished data from the drug companies: this is information that doctors and patients aren’t allowed to see, despite the fact that they are the people making decisions about whether to prescribe the drugs, or are actually taking them. but when nice does get information in this way, it can come with strict conditions on confidentiality, leading to some very bizarre documents being published. on the opposite page, for example, is the nice document discussing whether it’s a good idea to have lucentis, an extremely expensive drug, costing well over £1,000 per treatment, that is injected into the eye for a condition called acute macular degeneration.  as you can see, the nice document on whether this treatment is a good idea is censored. not only is the data on the effectiveness of the treatment blanked out by thick black rectangles, in case any doctor or patient should see it; absurdly, even the names of some trials are missing, preventing the reader from even knowing of their existence, or cross referencing information about them. most disturbing of all, as you can see in the last bullet point, the data on adverse events is also censored: i’m reproducing the whole page here because i worry that it would otherwise be almost too bizarre for you to believe. this level of censorship isn’t an everyday phenomenon; but it illustrates the absurdity of what medicine has come to accept, in professional documents that most people wouldn’t bother to read.69  why shouldn’t we all – doctors, patients and nice – have access to the information on trials that regulators see? this is something i asked both kent woods from the mhra, and hans georg eichler, medical director of the european medicines agency, in 2010. both, separately, gave me the same answer: people outside the agencies cannot be trusted with this information, because they might misinterpret it, either deliberately or through incompetence. both, separately – though i guess they must chat at parties – raised the mmr vaccine scare, as the classic example of how the media can contrive a national panic on the basis of no good evidence, creating dangerous public-health problems along the way. what if they released raw safety data, and people who don’t know how to analyse it properly found imaginary patterns, and created scares that put patients off taking life-saving medication?  i accept that this is a risk, but i also believe their priorities are wrong: i think that the advantages of many eyes working on these vitally important problems are enormous, and the possibility of a few irrational scaremongers is no excuse for hiding data. drug companies and regulators also both say that you can already get all the information you need from regulators’ websites, in summary form.  we shall now see that this is untrue.  two: regulators make it hard to access the data they do have  when exposed to criticism, drug companies often become indignant, and declare that they already share enough data for doctors and patients to be informed. ‘we give everything to the regulator,’ they say, ‘and you can get it from them.’ similarly, regulators insist that all you need to do is look on their website, and you will easily find all the data you need. in reality, there is a messy game, in which doctors and academics trying to find all the data on a drug are sent around the houses, scrabbling for information that is both hard to find and fatally flawed.  firstly, as we’ve already seen, regulators don’t have all the trials, and they don’t share all the ones that they do. summary documents are available on the early trials used to get a drug onto the market in the first place, but only for the specific licensed uses of the drug. even where the regulator has been given safety data for off-label uses (following the paroxetine case above) the information from these trials still isn’t made publicly available through the regulator: it simply sits quietly in the regulator’s files.  for example: duloxetine is another drug in fairly widespread use, which is usually given as an antidepressant. during a trial on its use for a completely different purpose – treating incontinence – there were apparently several suicides.70 this is important and interesting information, and the fda holds the relevant data: it conducted a review on this issue, and came to a view on whether the risk was significant. but you cannot see any of that on the fda website, because duloxetine never got a licence for use in treating incontinence.71 the trial data was only used by the fda to inform its internal ruminations. this is an everyday situation.  but even when you are allowed to see trial results held by regulators, getting this information from their public websites is supremely tricky. the search functions on the fda website are essentially broken, while the content is haphazard and badly organised, with lots missing, and too little information to enable you to work out if a trial was prone to bias by design. once again – partly, here, through casual thoughtlessness and incompetence – it is impossible to get access to the basic information that we need. drug companies and regulators deny this: they say that if you search their websites, everything is there. so let’s walk, briefly, through the process in all its infuriating glory. the case i will use was published three years ago in jama as a useful illustration of how broken the fda site has become:72 replicating it today, in 2012, nothing has changed.  so: let’s say we want to find the results from all the trials the fda has, on a drug called pregabalin, in which the drug is used to treat pain for diabetics whose nerves have been affected by their disease (a condition called ‘diabetic peripheral neuropathy’). you want the fda review on this specific use, which is the pdf document containing all the trials in one big bundle. but if you search for ‘pregabalin review’, say, on the fda website, you get over a hundred documents: none of them is clearly named, and not one of them is the fda review document on pregabalin. if you type in the fda application number – the unique identifier for the fda document you’re looking for – the fda website comes up with nothing at all.  if you’re lucky, or wise, you’ll get dropped at the drugs@fda page: typing ‘pregabalin’ there brings up three ‘fda applications’. why three? because there are three different documents, each on a different condition that pregabalin can be used to treat. the fda site doesn’t tell you which condition each of these three documents is for, so you have to use trial and error to try to find out. that’s not as easy as it sounds. i have the correct document for pregabalin and diabetic peripheral neuropathy right here in front of me: it’s almost four hundred pages long, but it doesn’t tell you that it’s about diabetic peripheral neuropathy until you get to here. there’s no executive summary at the beginning – in fact, there’s no title page, no contents page, no hint of what the document is even about, and it skips randomly from one sub-document to another, all scanned and bundled up in the same gigantic file.  if you’re a nerd, you might think: these files are electronic; they’re pdfs, a type of file specifically designed to make sharing electronic documents convenient. any nerd will know that if you want to find something in an electronic document, it’s easy: you just use the ‘find’ command: type in, say, ‘peripheral neuropathy’, and your computer will find the phrase straight off. but no: unlike almost any other serious government document in the world, the pdfs from the fda are a series of photographs of pages of text, rather than the text itself. this means you cannot search for a phrase. instead, you have to go through it, searching for that phrase, laboriously, by eye.  i could go on. i will. there’s some kind of ‘table of contents’ on the seventeenth page, but it gets the page numbers wrong. i’ve finished now. there is simply no reason for this obfuscation and chaos. these problems aren’t caused by technical issues specific to trials, and they would hardly cost any money at all to fix. this is plainly, simply, unhelpful, and the best we can hope is that it’s driven by thoughtlessness.  that’s a tragedy, because if you can unearth this document, and decode it, you will find that it is full of terrifying gems: perfect examples of situations in which a drug company has used dodgy statistical methods to design and analyse a study, in such a way that it is predestined – from the outset – to exaggerate the benefits of the drug.  for example, in the five trials on pregabalin and pain, lots of people dropped out during the study period. this is common in medical trials, as you will shortly see, and it often happens because people have found a drug to be unhelpful, or have had bad side effects. during these trials you’re measuring pain at regular intervals. but if some people drop out, you’re left with an important question: what kind of pain score should you use for them in your results? we know, after all, that people dropping out are more likely to have done badly on the drug.  pfizer decided to use a method called ‘last observation carried forward’, which means what you’d expect: you take the last measurement of pain severity while the patients were on the drug, from just before they dropped out, and then paste that in for all the remaining pain measures that they missed, after they stopped coming to follow-up appointments.  the fda disapproved of this: it pointed out, quite correctly, that pfizer’s strategy would make the drug look better than it really is. for a fairer picture, we have to assume that the drop-outs stopped taking the drug because of side effects, so their pain score should reflect the reality, which is that they would never get any benefit from the drug in normal use. the correct level of pain to record for them is, therefore, their pain at the beginning of the study, before they had any kind of treatment (if you’re interested, this is called ‘baseline observation carried forward’). the analysis was duly redone, properly, and a more modest, more accurate view of the benefits of the drug was produced. in this case, it turns out that using the ‘last observation’ method overestimated the improvement in pain by about a quarter.  here’s the catch. four out of five of these trials were then published in the peer-reviewed academic literature, the place where doctors look for evidence on whether a drug works or not (one trial wasn’t published at all). every single one of the published analyses used ‘last observation carried forward’, the dodgy method, the one that exaggerates the benefits of the drug. not one of them acknowledges that ‘last observation’ is a technique that overstates these benefits.  you can see why it is important that we have access to all the information we can possibly get on every drug trial: not only are some whole trials withheld from us, but there are often hidden flaws in the methods used. the devil is in the detail, and there are many dodgy trials, as we shall soon see, with flaws that may not be clear even in the academic papers, let alone in the thin and uninformative summaries from regulators. furthermore, as we shall also see very shortly, there are often worrying discrepancies between the regulators’ summary documents and what actually happened in the trial.  this is why we need to get hold of a more detailed document on each trial: something called the clinical study report (csr). these are long pieces of work, sometimes thousands of pages, but they are complete enough for the reader to reconstruct exactly what happened to all the participants; and they will let you find out where the bodies are buried. drug companies give this study report to the regulator – though still only for formally licensed uses of the drug – so both have a copy, and both should be happy to hand it over.  we will now see what happens when you ask them.  three: regulators withhold study reports that they do have  in 2007, researchers from the nordic cochrane centre were working on a systematic review for two widely used diet drugs, orlistat and rimonabant. a systematic review, as you know, is the gold-standard summary of the evidence on whether a treatment is effective. these are life-saving, because they give us the best possible understanding of the true effects of a treatment, including its side effects. but doing this requires access to all of the evidence: if some is missing, especially if unflattering data is deliberately harder to obtain, we will be left with a distorted picture.  the researchers knew that the trial data they were able to find in the published academic literature was probably incomplete, because negative trials are routinely left unpublished. but they also knew that the european medicines agency (ema) would have much of this information, since the manufacturers of drugs are obliged to give the study reports to the regulator when trying to get them onto the market. since regulators are supposed to act in the interests of patients, they applied to the ema for the protocols and the study reports. that was in june 2007.  in august, the ema responded: it had decided not to give out the study reports for these trials, and was invoking the section of its rules which allows it to protect the commercial interests and intellectual property of drug companies. the researchers replied immediately, almost by return of post: there is nothing in the study reports that will undermine the protection of someone’s commercial interests, they explained. but if there was, could the ema please explain why it felt the commercial interests of the drug companies should override the welfare of patients?  we should pause for just one moment, and think about what the ema is doing here. it is the regulator that approves and monitors drugs for the whole of europe, with the aim of protecting the public. doctors and patients can only make meaningful decisions about treatments if they have access to all the data. the ema has that data, but has decided that the drug companies’ interests are more important. having spoken to a lot of people in regulation, i can offer one small insight into what on earth they might be thinking. regulators, in my experience, are preoccupied with the idea that they see all the data, and use it to make the decision about whether a drug should go on the market, and that this is enough: doctors and patients don’t need to see the data, because the regulator has done all that work.  this misunderstands a crucial difference between the decisions made by regulators and the decisions made by doctors. contrary to what some regulators seem to think, a drug is not either ‘good’ and therefore on the market, or ‘bad’ and therefore off it. a regulator makes a decision about whether it’s in the interests of the population as a whole that the drug should be available for use, at all, ever – even if only in some very obscure circumstance, infrequently and cautiously. this bar is set pretty low, as we shall see, and lots of drugs that are on the market (in fact, the overwhelming majority) are hardly ever used.  a doctor needs to use the same information as that available to the regulator in order to make a very different decision: is this the right drug for the patient in front of me right now? the simple fact that a drug is approved for prescription doesn’t mean it’s particularly good, or the best. in fact, there are complex decisions to be made in each clinical situation about which drug is best. maybe the patient has failed to get better on one drug, so you want to try another, from a different class of drugs; maybe the patient has mild kidney failure, so you don’t want to use the most popular drug, as that causes very occasional problems in patients with dodgy kidneys; maybe you need a drug that won’t interfere with other drugs the patient is taking.  these complex considerations are the reason we are ok with having a range of drugs on the market: even if some of them are less useful overall, they might be useful in specific circumstances. but we need to be able to see all of the information about them, in order to make these decisions. it is not enough for the regulators to grandly state that they have approved a drug, and therefore we should all feel happy to prescribe it. doctors and patients need the data just as much as regulators do.  in september 2007 the ema confirmed to the cochrane researchers that it wasn’t going to share the study reports on orlistat and rimonabant, and explained that it had a policy of never disclosing the data given as part of a marketing authorisation. a serious problem had emerged. these weight-loss drugs were being widely prescribed throughout europe, but doctors and patients were unable to access important information about whether they worked, how bad the side effects were, which was more effective, or any of a whole host of other important questions. real patients were being exposed to potential harm, in everyday prescribing decisions, through this lack of information that was enforced by the ema.  the researchers went to the european ombudsman with two clear allegations. firstly, the ema had failed to give sufficient reasons for refusing them access to the data; and secondly, the ema’s brief, dismissive claim that commercial interests must be protected was unjustified, because there was no material of commercial interest in the trial results, other than the data on safety and effectiveness, which doctors and patients obviously need to access. they didn’t know it at the time, but this was the beginning of a battle for data that would shame the ema, and would last more than three years.  it took four months for the ema to respond, and over the next year it simply reiterated its position: as far as it was concerned, any kind of information the disclosure of which would ‘unreasonably undermine or prejudice the commercial interests of individuals or companies’ was commercially confidential. the study reports, it said, might contain information about the commercial plans for the drug. the researchers responded that this was unlikely, but was in any case of marginal importance, as part of a much more important and pressing situation: ‘as a likely consequence of   ema’s position, patients would die unnecessarily, and would be treated with inferior and potentially harmful drugs.’ they regarded the ema’s position as ethically indefensible. more than that, they said, the ema had a clear conflict of interest: this data could be used to challenge its summary views on the benefits and risks of these treatments. the ema had failed to explain why doctors and patients having access to study reports and protocols should undermine anyone’s reasonable commercial interests, and why these commercial interests were more important than the welfare of patients.  then, almost two years into this process, the ema changed tack. suddenly, it began to argue that study reports contain personal data about individual patients. this argument hadn’t been raised by the ema before, but it’s also not true. there may have been some information in some whole sections of the study reports that gave detail on some individual participants’ odd presentations, or on possible side effects, but these were all in the same appendix, and could easily be removed.  the eu ombudsman’s conclusions were clear: the ema had failed in its duty to give an adequate or even coherent explanation of why it was refusing access to this important information. he made a preliminary finding of maladministration. after doing that, he was under no obligation to offer any further opinion on the weak excuses offered by the ema, but he decided to do so anyway. his report is damning. the ema had flatly failed to address a serious charge that its withholding information about these trials was against the public interest, and exposed patients to harm. the ombudsman also described how he had gone through the study reports in detail himself, and had found that they contained neither any commercially confidential information, nor any details about the commercial development of the drugs. the ema’s claims that answering the request would have put it under an inappropriate administrative burden were untrue, and it had overestimated the work this would have involved: specifically, he explained, removing any personal data, where it did sometimes appear, would be easy.  the ombudsman told the ema to hand over the data, or produce a convincing explanation of why it shouldn’t. amazingly, the ema, the drugs regulator covering the whole of europe, still refused to hand over the documents. during this delay, people certainly suffered unnecessarily, and some possibly also died, simply for want of information. but the behaviour of the ema then deteriorated even further, into the outright surreal. any scrap of the company’s thinking about how to run the trial, it argued, which could be intuited from reading the study reports and protocols, was commercially sensitive with respect to its thoughts and plans. this was true, the ema said, even though the drugs were already on the market, and the information was from final clinical trials, at the very end of the commercial drug-development process. the researchers responded that this was perverse: they knew that withheld data is often negative, so if anything, any other company seeing negative data about these drugs would be less likely to try to get a competitor to market, if it appeared that the benefits of the drugs were more modest than had been thought.  that wasn’t the end of it. the ema also grandly dismissed the idea that lives were at risk, stating that the burden of proof was on the researchers to demonstrate this. to me this is – if you can forgive me – a slightly contemptuous attitude, especially given what happens in the next paragraph. it’s plainly true that if doctors and patients are unable to see which is the best treatment, then they will make worse decisions, exposing patients to unnecessary harm. furthermore, it is obvious that larger numbers of academics making transparent judgements about publicly accessible trial data are a much more sensible way of determining the risks and benefits of an intervention than a brief blanket ‘yes or no’ edict and summary from a regulator. this is all true of drugs like orlistat and rimonabant, but it’s also true of any drug, and we will see many cases where academics spotted problems with drugs that regulators had missed.  then, in 2009, one of the two drugs, rimonabant, was taken off the market, on the grounds that it increases the risk of serious psychiatric problems and suicide. this, at the same time that the ema was arguing that researchers were wrong to claim that withholding information was harming patients.  and then the ema suddenly claimed that the design of a randomised trial itself is commercially confidential information.  in case it needs reiterating, let me remind you that the first trial appears in the bible, daniel 1:12, and although the core ideas have certainly been refined over time, all trials are essentially identical experiments, generic across any field, with the basics of a modern trial sketched out at least half a century ago. there is absolutely no earthly sense in which anyone could realistically claim that the design of a randomised controlled trial is a commercially confidential or patentable piece of intellectual property.  this was now a farce. the researchers opened all barrels. the ema was in breach of the declaration of helsinki, the international code of medical ethics, which states that everyone involved in research has a duty to make trial findings public. the researchers knew that published papers give a flattering subset of the trial data, and so did the ema. patients would die if the ema continued to withhold data. there was nothing of serious commercial value in there. the ema’s brief public summaries of the data were inaccurate. the ema was complicit in the exploitation of patients for commercial gain.  it was now august 2009, and the researchers had been fighting for more than two years for access to data on two widely prescribed drugs, from the very organisation that is supposed to be protecting patients and the public. they weren’t alone. the french ‘prescribers’ bulletin’ prescrire was trying at the same time to get the ema’s documents on rimonabant. it was sent some unhelpful documents, including the rather remarkable ‘final assessment report’, from the swedish agency that had handled the drug’s approval much earlier. you can read this pdf in full online. or rather, you can’t. on the following page you can see exactly what the scientific analysis of the drug looked like – the document the ema sent to one of france’s most respected journals for doctors.73 i think it tells a rather clear story, and to add to the insult, there are sixty pages of this in total.  in the meantime, the danish medical authority had handed over fifty-six study reports to cochrane (though it still needed more from the ema); a complaint from the drug company about this had been rejected by the danish government, which had seen no problem with commercial information (there was none), nor administrative hassle (it was minimal), nor the idea that the design of a randomised trial is commercial information (which is laughable). this was chaos. the ema – which you may remember was responsible for eudract, the transparency tool that is held in secret – was going out on a very peculiar limb. it seemed that it would do anything it could to withhold this information from doctors and patients. as we shall see, sadly, this level of secrecy is its stock in trade.  but now we come to the end of this particular road for the ema. it handed the full, final study reports over to the ombudsman, reminding him that even the table of contents for each was commercial. once he had had these documents in his hand, his final opinion came swiftly. there was no commercial data here. there was no confidential patient information here. hand it over to the public, now. the ema, at glacial pace, agreed to set a deadline for delivering the data to the researchers, doctors and patients who needed it. the ombudsman’s final ruling was published at the end of november 2010.74 the initial complaint was made in june 2007. that is a full three and a half years of fighting, obstruction and spurious arguments from the ema, during which one of the drugs had to be removed from the market because it was harming patients.  after this precedent had been set, things had to shift at the ema; it was forced to revise its approach, and study reports were briefly made more widely available under a new policy (this window has just been shut down, in 2013, as you will read in the afterword). but even this policy of sharing reports did not solve the problem of access to all information about a trial: the ema often doesn’t hold all the modules, of all the reports, for all the uses of all the medicines it has approved. and it only holds records for the most recent few years, which is hopelessly incomplete, since in medicine we use treatments that have come on the market over the past few decades. in fact, this loophole is illustrated by the very first request made by the cochrane researchers who won this great breakthrough with the ombudsman. they applied for documents on antidepressants: a good place to start, since these drugs have been the focus of some particularly bad behaviour over the years (though we should remember that missing trial data pervades every corner of medicine). what happened next was even more bizarre than the ema’s three-year battle to withhold information on orlistat and rimonabant.  the researchers put in their request to the ema, but were told that the drugs had been approved back in the era when marketing authorisations were given out by individual countries, rather than by the ema centrally. these local authorisations were then ‘copied’ to all other nations. the mhra, the uk drugs regulator, held the information the researchers wanted, so they would have to approach it for a copy. the researchers dutifully wrote to the mhra, asked for the reports on a drug called fluoxetine, and then waited patiently. finally the answer came: the mhra explained that it would be happy to hand over this information, but there was a problem.  the documents had all been shredded.75  this was in keeping, it explained, with the agency’s retention policy, which was that such documents were only kept if they were of particular scientific, historical or political interest, and the files didn’t meet those criteria. let’s just take a moment to think through what the criteria must be. the ssri antidepressant drugs have seen many scandals on hidden data, and that should be enough on its own, but if you think back to the beginning of this chapter, one of them – paroxetine – was involved in an unprecedented, four-year-long investigation into whether criminal charges could be brought against gsk. that investigation into paroxetine was the largest investigation that the mhra has ever conducted into drug safety: in fact, it was the largest investigation the mhra has ever conducted, of any kind, ever. quite apart from that, these original study reports contain vitally important data on safety and efficacy. but the mhra shredded them all the same, feeling that they were not of sufficient scientific, historical or political interest.76  i can only leave you there.  where are we so far?  the missing data saga is long and complex, and involves patients around the world being put at risk, and some major players which have let us down to an extraordinary extent. since we are almost at the end of it, this is a good moment to gather together what we’ve seen so far.  trials are frequently conducted, but then left unpublished, and so are unavailable to doctors and patients. only half of all trials get published, and those with negative results are twice as likely to go missing as those with positive ones. this means that the evidence on which we base decisions in medicine is systematically biased to overstate the benefits of the treatments we give. since there is no way to compensate for this missing data, we have no way of knowing the true benefits and risks of the drugs doctors prescribe.  this is research misconduct on a grand, international scale. the reality of the problem is universally recognised, but nobody has bothered to fix it:     *ethics committees allow companies and individual      researchers with a track record of unpublished data to do more      trials on human participants.     *university administrators and ethics committees permit      contracts with industry that explicitly say the sponsor can      control the data.     *registers have never been enforced.     *academic journals continue to publish trials that were      unregistered, despite pretending that they won’t.     *regulators have information that would be vital to improve      patient care, but are systematically obstructive:     *they have poor systems to share poor summaries of the      information that they do have;     *and they are bizarrely obstructive of people asking for more      information.     *drug companies hold trial results that even regulators don’t      see.     *governments have never implemented laws compelling      companies to publish data.     *doctors’ and academics’ professional bodies have done nothing.  what to do about all this?  you will need to wait, because in the next section there are even greater horrors to come.  trying to get trial data from drug companies: the story of tamiflu  governments around the world have spent billions of pounds on stockpiling a drug called tamiflu. in the uk alone we have spent several hundred million pounds – the total figure is not yet clear – and so far we’ve bought enough tablets to treat 80 per cent of the population if an outbreak of bird flu occurs. i’m very sorry if you have the flu, because it’s horrid being ill; but we have not spent all this money to reduce the duration of your symptoms in the event of a pandemic by a few hours (though tamiflu does do this, fairly satisfactorily). we have spent this money to reduce the rate of ‘complications’: a medical euphemism, meaning pneumonia and death.  lots of people seem to think tamiflu will do this. the us department of health and human services said it would save lives and reduce hospital admissions. the european medicines agency said it would reduce complications. the australian drugs regulator said so too. roche’s website said it reduces complications by 67 per cent.77 but what is the evidence that tamiflu really will reduce complications? answering questions like this is the bread and butter of the cochrane collaboration, which you will remember is the vast and independent non-profit international collaboration of academics producing hundreds of systematic reviews on important questions in medicine every year. in 2009 there was concern about a flu pandemic, and an enormous amount of money was being spent on tamiflu. because of this, the uk and australian governments specifically asked the cochrane acute respiratory infections group to update its earlier reviews on the drug.  cochrane reviews are in a constant review cycle, because evidence changes over time as new trials are published. this should have been a pretty everyday piece of work: the previous review, in 2008, had found some evidence that tamiflu does indeed reduce the rate of complications. but then a japanese paediatrician called keiji hayashi left a comment that would trigger a revolution in our understanding of how evidence-based medicine should work. this wasn’t in a publication, or even a letter: it was a simple online comment, posted underneath the tamiflu review on the cochrane website.  you’ve summarised the data from all the trials, he explained, but your positive conclusion is really driven by data from just one of the papers you cite, an industry-funded meta-analysis led by an author called kaiser. this, ‘the kaiser paper’, summarises the findings of ten earlier trials, but from these ten trials, only two have ever been published in the scientific literature. for the remaining eight, your only information comes from the brief summary in this secondary, industry source. that’s not reliable enough.  in case it’s not immediately obvious, this is science at its best. the cochrane review is readily accessible online; it explains transparently the methods by which it looked for trials, and then analysed them, so any informed reader can pull the review apart, and understand where the conclusions came from. cochrane provides an easy way for readers to raise criticisms. and, crucially, these criticisms did not fall on deaf ears. tom jefferson is an editor at the cochrane acute respiratory infections group, and the lead author on the 2008 review. he realised immediately that he had made a mistake in blindly trusting the kaiser data. he said so, without any defensiveness, and then set about getting the information in a straight, workpersonlike fashion. this began a three-year battle, which is still not resolved, but which has thrown stark light on the need for all researchers to have access to clinical study reports on trials wherever possible.  first, the cochrane researchers wrote to the authors of the kaiser paper, asking for more information. in reply, they were told that this team no longer had the files, and that they should contact roche, the manufacturer of tamiflu. so naturally they wrote to roche and asked for the data.  this is where the problems began. roche said it would hand over some data, but the cochrane reviewers would need to sign a confidentiality agreement. this was an impossibility for any serious scientist: it would prevent them from conducting a systematic review with any reasonable degree of openness and transparency. more than this, the proposed contract also raised serious ethical issues, in that it would have required the cochrane team to actively withhold information from the reader: it included a clause saying that on signing it, the reviewers would never be allowed to discuss the terms of this secrecy agreement; and more than that, they would be forbidden from ever publicly acknowledging that it even existed. roche was demanding a secret contract, with secret terms, requiring secrecy about trial data, in a discussion about the safety and efficacy of a drug that has been taken by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. jefferson asked for clarification, and never received a reply.  then, in october 2009, the company changed tack: they would like to hand the data over, they explained, but another meta-analysis was being conducted elsewhere. roche had given them the study reports, so cochrane couldn’t have them. this was a simple non-sequitur: there is no reason why many groups shouldn’t all work on the same question. in fact, quite the opposite: replication is the cornerstone of good science. roche’s excuse made no sense. jefferson asked for clarification, but never received a reply.  one week later, unannounced, roche sent seven short documents, each around a dozen pages long. these contained excerpts of internal company documents on each of the clinical trials in the kaiser meta-analysis. this was a start, but it didn’t contain anything like enough information for cochrane to assess the benefits, or the rate of adverse events, or fully to understand exactly what methods were used in the trials.  at the same time, it was rapidly becoming clear that there were odd inconsistencies in the information on this drug. firstly, there was considerable disagreement at the level of the broad conclusions drawn by different organisations. the fda said there were no benefits on complications, while the centers for disease control and prevention (in charge of public health in the usa – some wear nice naval uniforms in honour of their history on the docks) said it did reduce complications. the japanese regulator made no claim for complications, but the ema said there was a benefit. in a sensible world, we might think that all these organisations should sing from the same hymn sheet, because all would have access to the same information. of course, there is also room for occasional, reasonable disagreement, especially where there are close calls: this is precisely why doctors and researchers should have access to all the information about a drug, so that they can make their own judgements.  meanwhile, reflecting these different judgements, roche’s own websites said completely different things in different jurisdictions, depending on what the local regulator had said. it’s naïve, perhaps, to expect consistency from a drug company, but from this and other stories it’s clear that industry utterances are driven by the maximum they can get away with in each territory, rather than any consistent review of the evidence.  in any case, now that their interest had been piqued, the cochrane researchers also began to notice that there were odd discrepancies between the frequency of adverse events in different databases. roche’s global safety database held 2,466 neuropsychiatric adverse events, of which 562 were classified as ‘serious’. but the fda database for the same period held only 1,805 adverse events in total. the rules vary on what needs to be notified to whom, and where, but even allowing for that, this was odd.  in any case, since roche was denying them access to the information needed to conduct a proper review, the cochrane team concluded that they would have to exclude all the unpublished kaiser data from their analysis, because the details could not be verified in the normal way. people cannot make treatment and purchasing decisions on the basis of trials if the full methods and results aren’t clear: the devil is often in the detail, as we shall see in chapter 4, on ‘bad trials’, so we cannot blindly trust that every study is a fair test of the treatment.  this is particularly important with tamiflu, because there are good reasons to think that these trials were not ideal, and that published accounts were incomplete, to say the least. on closer examination, for example, the patients participating were clearly unusual, to the extent that the results may not be very relevant to normal everyday flu patients. in the published accounts, patients in the trials are described as typical flu patients, suffering from normal flu symptoms like cough, fatigue, and so on. we don’t do blood tests on people with flu in routine practice, but when these tests are done – for surveillance purposes – then even during peak flu season only about one in three people with ‘flu’ will actually be infected with the influenza virus, and most of the year only one in eight will really have it. (the rest are sick from something else, maybe just a common cold virus.)  two thirds of the trial participants summarised in the kaiser paper tested positive for flu. this is bizarrely high, and means that the benefits of the drug will be overstated, because it is being tested on perfect patients, the very ones most likely to get better from a drug that selectively attacks the flu virus. in normal practice, which is where the results of these trials will be applied, doctors will be giving the drug to real patients who are diagnosed with ‘flu-like illness’, which is all you can realistically do in a clinic. among these real patients, many will not actually have the influenza virus. this means that in the real world, the benefits of tamiflu on flu will be diluted, and many more people will be exposed to the drug who don’t actually have flu virus in their systems. this, in turn, means that the side effects are likely to creep up in significance, in comparison with any benefits. that is why we strive to ensure that all trials are conducted in normal, everyday, realistic patients: if they are not, their findings may not be relevant to the real world.  so the cochrane review was published without the kaiser data in december 2009, alongside some explanatory material about why the kaiser results had been excluded, and a small flurry of activity followed. roche put the short excerpts it had sent over online, and committed to make full study reports available (it still hasn’t done so).  what roche posted was incomplete, but it began a journey for the cochrane academics of learning a great deal more about the real information that is collected on a trial, and how that can differ from what is given to doctors and patients in the form of brief, published academic papers. at the core of every trial is the raw data: every single record of blood pressure of every patient, the doctors’ notes describing any unusual symptoms, investigators’ notes, and so on. a published academic paper is a short description of the study, usually following a set format: an introductory background; a description of the methods; a summary of the important results; and then finally a discussion, covering the strengths and weaknesses of the design, and the implications of the results for clinical practice.  a clinical study report, or csr, is the intermediate document that stands between these two, and can be very long, sometimes thousands of pages.78 anybody working in the pharmaceutical industry is very familiar with these documents, but doctors and academics have rarely heard of them. they contain much more detail on things like the precise plan for analysing the data statistically, detailed descriptions of adverse events, and so on.  these documents are split into different sections, or ‘modules’. roche has shared only ‘module 1’, for only seven of the ten study reports cochrane has requested. these modules are missing vitally important information, including the analysis plan, the randomisation details, the study protocol (and the list of deviations from that), and so on. but even these incomplete modules were enough to raise concerns about the universal practice of trusting academic papers to give a complete story about what happened to the patients in a trial.  for example, looking at the two papers out of ten in the kaiser review which were published, one says: ‘there were no drug-related serious adverse events,’ and the other doesn’t mention adverse events. but in the ‘module 1’ documents on these same two studies, there are ten serious adverse events listed, of which three are classified as being possibly related to tamiflu.79  another published paper describes itself as a trial comparing tamiflu against placebo. a placebo is an inert tablet, containing no active ingredient, that is visually indistinguishable from the pill containing the real medicine. but the csr for this trial shows that the real medicine was in a grey and yellow capsule, whereas the placebos were grey and ivory. the ‘placebo’ tablets also contained something called dehydrocholic acid, a chemical which encourages the gall bladder to empty.80 nobody has any clear idea of why, and it’s not even mentioned in the academic paper; but it seems that this was not actually an inert, dummy pill placebo.  simply making a list of all the trials conducted on a subject is vitally important if we want to avoid seeing only a biased summary of the research done on a subject; but in the case of tamiflu even this proved to be almost impossible. for example, roche shanghai informed the cochrane group of one large trial (ml16369), but roche basel seemed not to know of its existence. but by setting out all the trials side by side, the researchers were able to identify peculiar discrepancies: for example, the largest ‘phase 3’ trial – one of the large trials that are done to get a drug onto the market – was never published, and is rarely mentioned in regulatory documents.fn3  there were other odd discrepancies. why, for example, was one trial on tamiflu published in 2010, ten years after it was completed?82 why did some trials report completely different authors, depending on where they were being discussed?83 and so on.  the chase continued. in december 2009 roche had promised: ‘full study reports will also be made available on a password-protected site within the coming days to physicians and scientists undertaking legitimate analyses’. this never happened. then an odd game began. in june 2010 roche said: oh, we’re sorry, we thought you had what you wanted. in july it announced that it was worried about patient confidentiality (you may remember this from the ema saga). this was an odd move: for most of the important parts of these documents, privacy is no issue at all. the full trial protocol, and the analysis plan, are both completed before any single patient is ever touched. roche has never explained why patient privacy prevents it from releasing the study reports. it simply continued to withhold them.  then in august 2010 it began to make some even more bizarre demands, betraying a disturbing belief that companies are perfectly entitled to control access to information that is needed by doctors and patients around the world to make safe decisions. firstly, it insisted on seeing the cochrane reviewers’ full analysis plan. fine, they said, and posted the whole protocol online. doing so is completely standard practice at cochrane, as it should be for any transparent organisation, and allows people to suggest important changes before you begin. there were few surprises, since all cochrane reports follow a pretty strict manual anyway. roche continued to withhold its study reports (including, ironically, its own protocols, the very thing it demanded cochrane should publish, and that cochrane had published, happily).  by now roche had been refusing to publish the study reports for a year. suddenly, the company began to raise odd personal concerns. it claimed that some cochrane researchers had made untrue statements about the drug, and about the company, but refused to say who, or what, or where. ‘certain members of cochrane group involved with the review of the neuraminidase inhibitors,’ it announced, ‘are unlikely to approach the review with the independence that is both necessary and justified.’ this is an astonishing state of affairs, where a company feels it should be allowed to prevent individual researchers access to data that should be available to all; but still roche refused to hand over the study reports.  then it complained that the cochrane reviewers had begun to copy journalists in on their emails when responding to roche staff. i was one of the people copied in on these interactions, and i believe that this was exactly the correct thing to do. roche’s excuses had become perverse, and the company had failed to keep its promise to share all study reports. it’s clear that the modest pressure exerted by researchers in academic journals alone was having little impact on roche’s refusal to release the data, and this is an important matter of public health, both for the individual case of this tamiflu data, and for the broader issue of companies and regulators harming patients by withholding information.  then things became even more perverse. in january 2011 roche announced that the cochrane researchers had already been given all the data they need. this was simply untrue. in february it insisted that all the studies requested were published (meaning academic papers, now shown to be misleading on tamiflu). then it declared that it would hand over nothing more, saying: ‘you have all the detail you need to undertake a review.’ but this still wasn’t true: it was still withholding the material it had publicly promised to hand over ‘within a few days’ in december 2009, a year and a half earlier.  at the same time, the company was raising the broken arguments we have already seen: it’s the job of regulators to make these decisions about benefit and risk, it said, not academics. now, this claim fails on two important fronts. firstly, as with many other drugs, we now know that not even the regulators had seen all the data. in january 2012 roche claimed that it ‘has made full clinical study data available to health authorities around the world for their review as part of the licensing process’. but the ema never received this information for at least fifteen trials. this was because the ema had never requested it.  and that brings us on to our final important realisation: regulators are not infallible. they make outright mistakes, and they make decisions which are open to judgement, and should be subject to second-guessing and checking by many eyes around the world. in the next chapter we will see more examples of how regulators can fail, behind closed doors, but here we will look at one story that illustrates the benefit of ‘many eyes’ perfectly.  rosiglitazone is a new kind of diabetes drug, and lots of researchers and patients had high hopes that it would be safe and effective.84 diabetes is common, and more people develop the disease every year. sufferers have poor control of their blood sugar, and diabetes drugs, alongside dietary changes, are supposed to fix this. although it’s nice to see your blood sugar being controlled nicely in the numbers from lab tests and machines at home, we don’t control these figures for their own sake: we try to control blood sugar because we hope that this will help reduce the chances of real-world outcomes, like heart attack and death, both of which occur at a higher rate in people with diabetes.  rosiglitazone was first marketed in 1999, and from the outset it was a magnet for disappointing behaviour. in that first year, dr john buse from the university of north carolina discussed an increased risk of heart problems at a pair of academic meetings. the drug’s manufacturer, gsk, made direct contact in an attempt to silence him, then moved on to his head of department. buse felt pressured to sign various legal documents. to cut a long story short, after wading through documents for several months, in 2007 the us senate committee on finance released a report describing the treatment of dr buse as ‘intimidation’.  but we are more concerned with the safety and efficacy data. in 2003 the uppsala drug monitoring group of the world health organization contacted gsk about an unusually large number of spontaneous reports associating rosiglitazone with heart problems. gsk conducted two internal meta-analyses of its own data on this, in 2005 and 2006. these showed that the risk was real, but although both gsk and the fda had these results, neither made any public statement about them, and they were not published until 2008.  during this delay, vast numbers of patients were exposed to the drug, but doctors and patients only learned about this serious problem in 2007, when cardiologist professor steve nissen and colleagues published a landmark meta-analysis. this showed a 43 per cent increase in the risk of heart problems in patients on rosiglitazone. since people with diabetes are already at increased risk of heart problems, and the whole point of treating diabetes is to reduce this risk, that finding was big potatoes. his findings were confirmed in later work, and in 2010 the drug was either taken off the market or restricted, all around the world.  now, my argument is not that this drug should have been banned sooner, because as perverse as it sounds, doctors do often need inferior drugs for use as a last resort. for example, a patient may develop idiosyncratic side effects on the most effective pills, and be unable to take them any longer. once this has happened, it may be worth trying a less effective drug, if it is at least better than nothing.  the concern is that these discussions happened with the data locked behind closed doors, visible only to regulators. in fact, nissen’s analysis could only be done at all because of a very unusual court judgement. in 2004, when gsk was caught out withholding data showing evidence of serious side effects from paroxetine in children, the uk conducted an unprecedented four-year-long investigation, as we saw earlier. but in the us, the same bad behaviour resulted in a court case over allegations of fraud, the settlement of which, alongside a significant payout, required gsk to commit to posting clinical trial results on a public website.  professor nissen used the rosiglitazone data, when it became available, found worrying signs of harm, and published this to doctors, which is something that the regulators had never done, despite having the information years earlier. (though before doctors got to read it, nissen by chance caught gsk discussing a copy of his unpublished paper, which it had obtained improperly.85)  if this information had all been freely available from the start, regulators might have felt a little more anxious about their decisions, but crucially, doctors and patients could have disagreed with them, and made informed choices. this is why we need wider access to full csrs, and all trial reports, for all medicines, and this is why it is perverse that roche should be able even to contemplate deciding which favoured researchers should be allowed to read the documents on tamiflu.  astonishingly, a paper published in april 2012 by regulators from the uk and europe suggests that they might agree to more data sharing, to a limited extent, within limits, for some studies, with caveats, at the appropriate juncture, and in the fullness of time.86 before feeling any sense of enthusiasm, we should remember that this is a cautious utterance, wrung out after the dismal fights i have already described; that it has not been implemented; that it must be set against a background of broken promises from all players across the whole field of missing data; and that in any case, regulators do not have all the trial data anyway. but it is an interesting start.  their two main objections – if we accept their goodwill at face value – are interesting, because they lead us to the final problem in the way we tolerate harm to patients from missing trial data. firstly, they raise the concern that some academics and journalists might use study reports to conduct histrionic or poorly conducted reviews of the data: to this, again, i say, ‘let them,’ because these foolish analyses should be conducted, and then rubbished, in public.  when uk hospital mortality statistics first became easily accessible to the public, doctors were terrified that they would be unfairly judged: the crude figures can be misinterpreted, after all, because one hospital may have worse figures simply because it is a centre of excellence, and takes in more challenging patients than its neighbours; and there is random variation to be expected in mortality rates anyway, so some hospitals might look unusually good, or bad, simply through the play of chance. initially, to an extent, these fears were realised: there were a few shrill, unfair stories, and people overinterpreted the results. now, for the most part, things have settled down, and many lay people are quite able to recognise that crude analyses of such figures are misleading. for drug data, where there is so much danger from withheld information, and so many academics desperate to conduct meaningful analyses, and so many other academics happy to criticise them, releasing the data is the only healthy option.  but secondly, the ema raises the spectre of patient confidentiality, and hidden in this concern is one final prize.  so far i have been talking about access to trial reports, summaries of patients’ outcomes in trials. there is no good reason to believe that this poses any threat to patient confidentiality, and where there are specific narratives that might make a patient identifiable – a lengthy medical description of one person’s idiosyncratic adverse event in a trial, perhaps – these can easily be removed, since they appear in a separate part of the document. these csrs should undoubtedly, without question, be publicly available documents, and this should be enforced retrospectively, going back decades, to the dawn of trials.  but all trials are ultimately run on individual patients, and the results of those individual patients are all stored and used for the summary analysis at the end of the study. while i would never suggest that these should be posted up on a public website – it would be easy for patients to be identifiable, from many small features of their histories – it is surprising that patient-level data is almost never shared with academics.  sharing data of individual patients’ outcomes in clinical trials, rather than just the final summary result, has several significant advantages. firstly, it’s a safeguard against dubious analytic practices. in the vigor trial on the painkiller vioxx, for example, a bizarre reporting decision was made.87 the aim of the study was to compare vioxx against an older, cheaper painkiller, to see if it was any less likely to cause stomach problems (this was the hope for vioxx), and also if it caused more heart attacks (this was the fear). but the date cut-off for measuring heart attacks was much earlier than that for measuring stomach problems. this had the result of making the risks look less significant, relative to the benefits, but it was not declared clearly in the paper, resulting in a giant scandal when it was eventually noticed. if the raw data on patients was shared, games like these would be far easier to spot, and people might be less likely to play them in the first place.  occasionally – with vanishing rarity – researchers are able to obtain raw data, and re-analyse studies that have already been conducted and published. daniel coyne, professor of medicine at washington university, was lucky enough to get the data on a key trial for epoetin, a drug given to patients on kidney dialysis, after a four-year-long fight.88 the original academic publication on this study, ten years earlier, had switched the primary outcomes described in the protocol (we will see later how this exaggerates the benefits of treatments), and changed the main statistical analysis strategy (again, a huge source of bias). coyne was able to analyse the study as the researchers had initially stated they were planning to in their protocol; and when he did, he found that they had dramatically overstated the benefits of the drug. it was a peculiar outcome, as he himself acknowledges: ‘as strange as it seems, i am now the sole author of the publication on the predefined primary and secondary results of the largest outcomes trial of epoetin in dialysis patients, and i didn’t even participate in the trial.’ there is room, in my view, for a small army of people doing the very same thing, reanalysing all the trials that were incorrectly analysed, in ways that deviated misleadingly from their original protocols.  data sharing would also confer other benefits. it allows people to conduct more exploratory analyses of data, and to better investigate – for example – whether a drug is associated with a particular unexpected side effect. it would also allow cautious ‘subgroup analyses’, to see if a drug is particularly useful, or particularly useless, in particular types of patients.  the biggest immediate benefit from data sharing is that combining individual patient data into a meta-analysis gives more accurate results than working with the crude summary results at the end of a paper. let’s imagine that one paper reports survival at three years as the main outcome for a cancer drug, and another reports survival at seven years. to combine these two in a meta-analysis, you’d have a problem. but if you were doing the meta-analysis with access to individual patient data, with treatment details and death dates for all of them, you could do a clean combined calculation for three-year survival.  darby s, mcgale p, correa c, taylor c, arriagada r,

forceful scientists just happen to have driven a pioneering culture of easier collaboration. the summaries they are publishing represent real collaboration, between vast numbers of people, and on vast numbers of patients, producing highly reliable guidance for doctors and patients.  the process sheds a stark light on the reality of data collaboration on such a large scale. here, for example, is the author list on an academic paper from the lancet in november 2011: it’s reporting an immense, definitive, and incredibly useful metaanalysis of breast cancer treatment outcomes, using individual patient data pooled from seventeen different trials. the author list is printed in four-point font size (though i suspect that might go wrong in the e-book edition …) because there are seven hundred individual researchers named in it. i typed each of them in by hand for you.  this is what medicine should look like. an honest list of all the people involved, free access to information, and all the data pooled together, giving the most accurate information we can manage, to inform real decisions, and so prevent avoidable suffering and death.  we are a very, very long way away from there.  what can be done?  we urgently need to improve access to trial data. in addition to the previous suggestions, there are small changes that would vastly improve access to information, and so improve patient care.     1. the results of all trials conducted on humans must be      made available within one year of completion, in summary      table form if academic journal publication has not occurred.      this requires the creation of a body that is charged with      publicly auditing whether or not trials have withheld results at      twelve months; and primary legislation that is enforced, as a      matter of urgency, internationally, with stiff penalties for      transgression. in my view these penalties should include fines,      but also prison terms for those who are found to be      responsible for withholding trial data, as patients are harmed      by this process.     2.all systematic reviews – such as cochrane reviews – that draw      together trial results on any clinical question should also      include a section on the trials which they know have been      conducted, but whose results are being withheld. this should      state: which completed trials have not reported results; how      many patients’ worth of information there is in each unreported      trial; the names of the organisations and the individuals who      are withholding the data; the efforts the reviewers have made      to get the information from them. this is trivial extra work, as      review teams already attempt to access this kind of data.      documenting this will draw attention to the problem, and make      it easier for doctors and the public to see who is responsible      for harming patient care in each area of medicine.     3. all clinical study reports should also be made publicly      available, for all the trials that have ever been conducted on      humans. this will be cheap, as the only costs are in finding one      paper copy, scanning it and placing it online, perhaps with a      check to remove confidential patient information. there is a      vast mountain of highly relevant data on drugs that is currently      being withheld, distorting what we know about treatments in      widespread current use. many of these documents will be      sitting in the dry paper archives of drug companies and      regulators. we need legislation compelling the industry to hand      them over. our failure to fix this is costing lives.     4. we need to work on new methods for academics to extract      summary information from these documents, as they are more      detailed than published academic papers. the cochrane group      working on tamiflu have made great progress here, learning as      they go, and this field will need manuals.     5. we should work towards all triallists having an obligation to      share patient-level data wherever possible, with convenient      online data warehouses,89 and streamlined systems      whereby legitimate senior researchers can make requests for      access, in order to conduct pooled analyses and double-check      the results reported in published trials.  none of this is difficult, or impossible. some of it is technical, for which i apologise. the field of missing data is a tragic and strange one. we have tolerated the emergence of a culture in medicine where information is routinely withheld, and we have blinded ourselves to the unnecessary suffering and death that follows from this. the people we should have been able to trust to handle all this behind the scenes – the regulators, the politicians, the senior academics, the patient organisations, the professional bodies, the universities, the ethics committees – have almost all failed us. and so i have had to inflict the details on you, in the hope that you can bring some pressure to bear yourself.  if you have any ideas about how we can fix this, and how we can force access to trial data – politically or technically – please write them up, post them online, and tell me where to find them.

“the thorn”50. neither reed nor jones granted permission to any of the defendants to use “the thorn” in any manner whatsoever. defendants’ use of “the thorn” was completely unauthorized and without the knowledge or consent of owners reed and jones.  51. upon information and belief, after obtaining copies of and/or listening to “the thorn”, one or all of the defendants created a sound recording titled “rigamortus”, which was a track on lamar’s section.80 (topdawg).  52. “rigamortus” is a hip-hip recording consisting entirely of the refrain from “the thorn” sound recording with lyrics added and performed by lamar.  53. “the thorn” is not merely a part of “rigamortus” or even the heart of “rigamortus”; it is “rigamortus”. the distinctive and catchy refrain from “the thorn” sound recording, sped up a bit, repeats as a continuous loop throughout the entire “rigamortus” song while lamar raps over it. the clever melodic triplets, infectious rhythm, and commanding horns from “the thorn” are copied to “rigamortus” directly from jones’ sound recording. defendants did not play any instruments or contribute any original musical performance to the “rigamortus” sound recording. the instrumental element of “rigamortus” and the composition that it embodies are owned and authored entirely by jones and reed respectively.  54. the lyrics to “rigamortus” and the performance thereof are the only elements of “rigamortus” not copied directly from “the thorn”.  55. despite having contributed no original music to “rigamortus”, lamar and brown registered their claim of copyright in the composition “rigamortus” with the copyright office as reflected by registration no. pa0001856022. their authorship is described as music and lyrics. records on file with ascap and the hfa show lamar, brown, and spears as authors, listing them and their associated publishers along with topdawg entertainment as copyright claimants entitled to royalties.  56. upon information and belief, after obtaining copies of and/or listening to “the thorn”, one or all of the defendants created a sound recording titled “rigamortus (remix)” featuring famous rapper, busta rhymes (topdawg).  57. “rigamortus (remix)” is nearly identical to “rigamortus”, containing the same musical elements from “the thorn” as “rigamortus”, only with additional lyrics performed and  presumably authored by busta rhymes.  58. “rigamortus (remix)” was released as a single by topdawg entertainment.  59. ascap records for “rigamortus (remix)” list only brown as sole author, despite that he contributed no original musical authorship to the work, and the remix is a mere variation of “rigamortus”.  60. upon information and belief, after obtaining copies of and/or listening to “the thorn”, one or all of the defendants created a sound recording titled “rigamortus (full instrumental)” (topdawg).  61. “rigamortus (full instrumental)” was released on ichiban: sound in 3d by defendant, brown (topdawg).  62. “rigamortus (full instrumental)” does not feature lyrics or vocal performances and consists only of the repeating loop that was taken from “the thorn” with minor sonic embellishments and studio sound effects added. authorship in the sound recording and the underlying musical composition belong entirely to reed and jones.striking similarity of the works61. the tde “rigamortus” songs all consist of the repeating loop of the distinctive and catchy refrain from “the thorn” sound recording.  62. “the thorn” and the tde “rigamortus” songs feature clever melodic triplets, infectious rhythm, and commanding horns.  63. the tde “rigamortus” songs’ striking similarity to “the thorn” is obvious, even to non-musicians. jones and reed became aware of the infringing “rigamortus” through non-musicians who brought the lamar recording to their attention. after performing “the thorn” live at dizzy’s club coca-cola in new york, reed was approached by two separate members of the audience who exclaimed that lamar sampled the song. a high school friend of jones’ saw lamar’s “rigamortus” video, immediately recognized “the thorn”, and contacted jones. the wikipedia page for section.80 states: “ ‘rigamortus’ contains a sample of ‘the thorn’ as  performed by willie jones iii”, and the website found at www.whosampled.com (image below) states that music from “the thorn” appears throughout “rigamortus”, even though lamar’s album does not list “the thorn” or its authors among the album credits.64. pianist kris bowers covered “rigamortus”, spelling it “rigamortis” and stating that the lamar recording contains music from “the thorn”, written by reed and recorded on jones’ the next phase.  65. all versions of “rigamortus” and “rigamortis”, starting with the tde “rigamortus” songs and including covers, remakes, remixes, and other variations thereof are infringing derivative works adapted from “the thorn”.access to reed/jones’ “the thorn”66. “the thorn” appeared on the next phase, which was released to the worldwide general public for purchase on july 20, 2010. online retailers itunes, amazon, and cdbaby carried the recording for anyone to purchase.  67. “the thorn” was available for listening via streaming audio on the internet from spotify, rhapsody, pandora, and others on the july 20, 2010 release date.  68. upon information and belief, one or all of the defendants obtained a copy of “the thorn” and copied it in order to make the tde “rigamortus” songs in 2011.  69. neither reed nor jones nor their affiliated companies gave permission to any of the defendants to copy, use, or otherwise exploit any of their music in any form whatsoever. defendants appropriated “the thorn” without the knowledge or consent of the rightful owners of the song and sound recording. defendants did so willfully; fully aware that the music they appropriated was not theirs and that they did not have permission to use it.  69. defendants did not attribute any of the musical element of the tde “rigamortus” songs to reed or jones. no album credit or other acknowledgement was afforded reed and jones for “the thorn”.  69. brown has made it of record that he is an avid listener of jazz and relative of trumpet legend clifford brown.  70. on september 7, 2011, brown contacted reed via facebook and inquired: “i need to ask you a question about sampling ..like if i were to sample your work for a hip hop record.. what would your feelings be about that?”  71. unaware that “the thorn” had already been misappropriated by brown, reed replied by suggesting that they talk in more detail in the future. reed did not consent to the use of any of his music in any part of the exchange with brown.  71. in a video posted to his own youtube channel on september 17, 2011, producer brown demonstrates exactly how he “created” “rigamortus”. the caption on the youtube page lists the following description for the video: “willie b plays the original sample of ‘rigamortus’ and shows the session in fruityloops. #hiiipower.” the video opens with brown addressing viewers and then shifts to his computer from which he plays “the thorn” and the monitor reads: “willie jones iii the thorn”. the entire video is 2:31 in length and no instruments are used. only the computer and the sound recording of “the thorn” are used to create “rigamortus” in less than three minutes.        72. in an interview posted on istandardproducers.com, brown stated that the “rigamortus” instrumental track was something he made in his mother’s back room with his only contribution being production. he went on to say that the track was really for a rap song that he wrote titled “the thorn”.defendants’ exploitation of “rigamortus” and other infringing derivative works and benefits derived therefrom73. “rigamortus” was released for worldwide purchase via the internet as part of lamar’s acclaimed section.80 (topdawg).  74. at the time of filing this complaint, plaintiffs are aware of the following versions of the infringing “rigamortus”: “rigamortus”, kendrick lamar:section.80; “rigamortus (remix)”, kendrick lamar featuring busta rhymes; “rigamortus (full instrumental)”, willie b:ichiban: sound in 3d; “rigamortis cover”, kris bowers; “rigamortis”, cgp all stars: all the  kings men; “rigamortis (instrumental)”, syndicate sound labs: kendrick’s instrumentals, vol. 1; “rigamortis”, redd:potential; and “national rigamortis (radiohead x kendrick lamar)”, the b.e.a.t.:undercover ep.  75. all songs listed in the preceding paragraph are being sold, performed, licensed, and otherwise exploited for money by the defendants.  76. the numerous remakes, remixes, and excessive exploitation of “rigamortus” are a testament to the immense popularity of the musical portion of the song. however, they have saturated the airwaves and diminished the market for licensing “the thorn” for use by other  producers.  77. pharrell williams praised lamar as one of the next great hip

"signifying rappers lyrics""the schools in a portion of boston stretching from just south of south boston through roxbury and into dorchester are districted with a similar effect: the predominantly black areas are cut away from the predominantly white areas.""  morgan v. hennigan, u.s. district court for massachusetts, 1974  the seek button on the ford's radio is working. the downtown recedes. miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield. the seek function locks on someplace in stereo, college fm probably. ""yeah,"" a new friend says, ""whas up. whas goin on."" the radio has another button, vol, which gets jacked repeatedly while the ford hurtles, happily, to the source of the noise. not to the station's broadcast booth on a campus across the river, nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs, but rather to rjam productions in north dorchester, where black kids from boston's now-integrated high schools-latin, madison park, jeremiah burke, mattapan-cut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radio's new friend, a young man named schoolly d who right now, at speaker-damaging volume, sounds darn big. ""before we start this next record…,"" schooly's saying. the record in question is called ""signifying rapper,"" a brief, bloody tale of ghetto retribution from side 2 of schoolly's smoke some kill. the black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in '74, and evidence is everywhere that nothing's changed since then. on the southbound left of the fitzgerald expressway pass 20 blocks of grim irish-catholic housing projects, the western border of belfast, complete with sinn fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious united ireland, a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the '74 court order that bused ""them"" from wherever it is ""they"" live-the third world fer crissakes--into 97-percent-white south boston. on the expressway's right is the place the fibula-busters are talking about: the simultaneous northern border of haiti, jamaica and georgia; a territory that maps of boston call north dorchester.  uniting the two sides of the expressway is just about nothing. both neighborhoods are tough and poor. both hate the college world across the river, which, because of boston's rotten public schools, they will never see as freshmen. and kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio, which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting the art of a ghetto philadelphian roughly their age, once much poorer than they, but now, on royalties from smoke some kill, very much richer.  not that the shared digging of black street music is news, or even new: twenty years ago, when morgan v. hennigan, boston's own brown v. board of education, was inching through the courts, and even dark-complected italians were sometimes unwelcome in the irish precincts east of the expressway, kids in boston's little belfast sang along with james brown over the radio. ""say it loud i'm black and i'm proud say it loud i'm black and i'm proud!""  except that halfway through the infectious funk, the crewcuts realize what they're saying: jesus christ, ""i'm proud to be black"" fer chrissakes, like when you're in the porno store, you know, and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the men's part, you know? not the part for men in the part that's about men, jesus, and you get the hell outta there. and so they hum/mumble the suppressed parts.  ""say it loud i'm mmm hum proud say it loud mum hum hum proud!""  but rap isn't funk, rock or jazz, and the vast crossover move, broadcasting ""ghetto"" music over college radios to ghettos of a different color, is no simple reenactment of past crossovers. how, for example, does the sing-along fan of smoke some kill mumble his way through these lines:  ""black is beautiful brown is sick? slick? stiff? yellow's ok but white ain't shit.""  rjam productions, modestly headquartered in a mixed black/hispanic field, corner section of north dorchester, is as follows:  * one (1) four-car garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block; * one (1) touch-tone telephone (leased); * two (2) chevy blazers, vanity-plated rjam1 and rjam2, each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks (also leased); * one (1) vcr with kathleen turner's body heat cued up on the morning in question; * most importantly, eight (8) promising acts under binding contract if, as has happened to many local labels, rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors, these would be the pieces. but there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneer's gavel. schoolly d, the original signifying rapper, looms irresistibly from the pages of rap ""fanzines"" hip-hop and the source; and rjam's prime, unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next schoolly d. or the next ice t, or kool moe dee, or l. l. cool j., or whoever's the special hero of the kid cutting the demo. on this particular morning, the dream is to be the next mc lyte--a hard-rapping woman known for jams like ""mc lyte vs. vanna whyte"" and ""10% dis""--since today is tam-tam's day and tam-tam is, at 16, a tough girl in the mc lyte mold who, like mc lyte, can dance, look good, and tell men to beat it, all at once.  or so claims tam-tam's producer, promoter, and dutch uncle, gary smith, who opened rjam on martin luther king's birthday, '89, with his older brother nate. nate, the elder statesman, is 25. gary, 22, runs the company while nate travels with his boyhood-friend-turned-boss, quadruple-platinum, prince-derived rapper/singer, bobby brown. rjam was founded in part with an investment from the 23-year-old multi-millionaire brown, a native of roxbury. brown now lives in los angeles.  nate and gary smith turn a healthy profit making demos at $500/tape, but the brothers aren't in the health business. their aim: to follow in the corporate footsteps of def jam, a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in hollis, queens, which since its basement days, has given america public enemy, l. l. cool j., the beastie boys, and much of the rest of that culture-quake called rap. gary smith doesn't compare rjam to def jam, and, unlike def jam's russell simmons, gary produces pop, soul, and r&b as well as straight rap, and actually prefers r&b. but how many sophomores at nearby jeremiah burke can afford to dream in r&b, to front music lessons and $500 for an nth-hand sound set-up, find three friends to learn drums, bass and keyboards, and then raise another $500 to make a demo at rjam? anybody with a larynx can rap, however, and rjam's brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman, boston edison and the chevrolet motor credit corp.  twenty minutes farther south on the fitzgerald expressway, across the neponset river and into the pricey suburbs, is the scene of john cheever's boyhood, more recently celebrated as massachusetts miracle country, where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week, four of which will fail within 12 months. rjam's gary smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban chambers of commerce, sharing their worries about cash flow, overhead, and the enforceability of his contracts; but gary's world and theirs are as far apart as those of ward and eldridge cleaver. worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives' seaside homes. in gary's neighborhood, property values are actually falling.  waiting less than patiently for tam-tam, gary honks twice. a tall, grave girl with an angel's heart-shaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of rjam1. she has, apparently, at least two voices, the cynical, sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling pebbles men ain't worth it, and the whisper in which she now says hello.  as rjam1 re-crosses north dorchester, heading back to the soundproof studios to get the day's work started, gary and dj reese hash out production details. tam-tam's a dignified island in the back seat, and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the motor city in '63 with berry gordy and an eighty-pound teenage diana ross, just voted best dressed at cass technical high school, driving crosstown to record a little number called ""where did our love go.""  ask tam-tam about diana ross, and she gives a beatific smile. she's 16; she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to, when rap was new and she was 8; run-dmc or somebody, she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences. like most of rap's black audience (as distinct from rap's white audience, which is usually a decade older), tam-tam has no first-hand recollection of james brown except as a source for rap. she is too young to have attended segregated schools. she was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in boston and can't remember the awful day in '74 when ""pro-neighborhood"" marchers from irish south boston came upon a black pedestrian at city hall and beat him with pole-mounted american flags.  tam-tam has star presence, and like many who do, she seems to see very little of what goes on around her, the price of the star's intense focus on self. she reminds you of senator gary hart. he, too, had star presence. in front of a crowd, hart was riveting; in the elevator riding up to the auditorium, he was barely there. being barely there in the neighborhood tam-tam calls home is probably not such a bad thing, and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here. ambition is, finally, a form of hope, a scarce commodity in north dorchester.  back in rjam's control booth, dj reese and producer ralph stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be ""ho, you're guilty."" drum parts are taken from a roland tr-909 rhythm composer, a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the user's choice of drum-matrix. the tr-909's keys, on a console designed to resemble, vaguely, the familiar piano, are named after the sound each creates-bass, snare, mid-tom, hi-tom--and the sounds are named after the actual drums which, until the tr-909, were required to make those sounds. the tr-909 even sports a key named hand clap, making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger, rendering obsolete the zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping. the finished ""ho, you're guilty"" will sound lush with percussion, melody, and instrumental breaks. not one human musician will be employed in the recording process.  each percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track: a snare track, a bass track, a clap track, etc. reese has been studying the classics lately, too, viz: james brown's dead on the heavy funk from '75ish, including the ageless groove, ""funky president,"" in which james announces his third-party candidacy. some of bobby byrd's dead guitar, and a holy moment when james exhales rhythmically, have been isolated from a store-bought cassette of dead, re-recorded on clean tape, then re-re-recorded onto a computer-readable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by ralph stacey using a roland d-50 linear synth. the guitar and the exhalation then go, as altered, from the synth to yet another of the 24 tracks on the big mixing board. reese, the dj, will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these 24 strands.  as reese and ralph stacey mix the 24 tracks onto one master tape, tam-tam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth. you ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf. she doesn't seem to register the question. ""the other career besides rap i'd like to pursue is modelling,"" she says. ""i'm five-seven. that's the perfect height for a model.""  mixing takes the rest of the day. producer ralph stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question: ""why do you want to write about rap, anyway?"" it is lucky that at that minute reese is done mixing. tomorrow the rjam staff will tape tam-tam's vocal track and lay this over reese's rhythm track. then the sound will be ""fattened"" with stacks of horns, guitar hooks, bells, canned applause, and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the rolands. the final demo tape of ""ho, you're guilty"" will then be shopped to the 20 major, minor, and tiny labels who might release the demo as a 12-inch single.  everyone's ready to call it a day. gary smith's already huddled with some new wanna-be stars in rjam's reception area. reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth, and tam-tam immediately stands, modelling forgotten, utterly alert. reese gestures to her with maestro hands. she raps at an absent antoinette in the hard, sexy voice you haven't heard since this morning, extemporaneous but on beat: ""i'm a female you're just a fairytale.""  the small-w we here are two white boston males: one native, one oft-transplanted; both residing in somerbridge, a dim, ethnic-portuguese neighborhood whose gentrification we abet. m. is an attorney with a taste for jazz, blues, funk; d. a grad student and would-be drifter who watches tv instead of sleeping. our cultural tastes and interests are day and night. they converged only lately, when d's stereo arrived ups and we discovered we shared an uncomfortable, somewhat furtive, and distinctively white enthusiasm for a certain music called rap/hip-hop.* about our passions and discomforts we could determine only that they were vague & distinct contexts and cathexes brought to bear across the same ethnic distance on the same thing. for instance, we agreed that real or serious rap is not jj fad or tone loc or beasties, egyptian lover or fat boys, not experiments or freakshows or current commercial crossover slush. ""serious"" rap--a unique u.s. inner-city fusion of funk, technified reggae, teen-to-teen ""hardcore"" rock, and the early 70s ""poetry of the black experience"" of nikki giavonni, the last poets, etc.--has, since its late-70s delivery at the record-scratching hands of afrika bambaataa and his zulu nation, sugarhill gang, kool herc and his automated herculords, and grandmaster flash, always had its real roots in the neighborhood, the black gang-banger underground. black music, of and for blacks.  we concurred as to the wheres and whens of rap's begetting--mid-to-late 70s' south bronx house parties; then, by decade's end, block parties, with municipal electric lights tapped for a power source, literal dancing in the streets; by '82, regular rap-houses and then ""floating clubs""--the roxy every sunday, the bronx's disco fever twth--everybody breaking to a new musical antimusic being fashioned from records and turntables and an amateur djs ad-lib banter; a very heavy reggae influence at the beginning; the more rhythmic pure rap an offshoot, its brisker, sparer, backbeat designed for breakdance, and the smooth-rapping partygoer who just didn't want to shut up when others' music was on. we agreed, too, on rough chronology: amateur house-partiers giving way to professional djs, pioneers; they, too, then overshadowed by new art-entrepreneurs, former breakers, failed singers, gag-majorettes; then the rise of ""indies,"" the tiny independent labels that keep most new music on life-support--sugar hill, jive, tommy boy, wild pitch, profile records, enjoy--then, after king tim iii's ""personality jock"" and sugarhill gang's ""rapper's delight,"" an entree into urban black radio; then to underground ""mix"" radio; then corporate levels, digital technology, very big money, the early-80s talent that became an early scene's cream--spoonie g. and sequence, eric fresh, unknown dj, egyptian lover and run-dmc. then, spring '84, the extraordinary midas touch of rick rubin and russell simmons' def jam label (now under contract to cbs) from which sprang a mid-80s stable of true stars, in the underground--public enemy, l. l. cool j, slick rick, the still-unparalleled eric b. and rakim--and l.a.'s alternatives: kool moe dee, l.a. dream team, and others. and now, at decade's end, an absolute explosion of rap-as-pop, big business, mtv, special fashions, posters, merchandise, with only a few big, new, cutting-edge acts--l.a.'s n.w.a., philadelphia's schoolly d, miami's 2 live crew, de la soul's house-blend of rap/funk/jazz--remaining too esoteric or threatening or downright obscene to cross all the way over and cash in with big labels. by '89 rap is finally proving as ""important"" (read also lucrative) to an anemic shock-and rebellion-music industry as punk was an exact decade ago. this was all just data. we agreed on it, and on how it was curious that we both had such strange, distant facts down cold.  our point of departure, essay-wise, was always less what we know than what we felt, listening: less what we liked than why. for this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap, trying to summon a kind of objective, critical, purely ""aesthetic"" passion that the music itself made impossible. for outsiders, rap's easy to move to, hard to dissect. the more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued, the more we felt that the stuff's appeal for two highbrow, upscale whites was just plain incongruous. because serious rap has, right from the start, presented itself as a closed show. usually critical questions of culture, context, background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions. not here. no question that serious rap is, and is very self-consciously, music by urban blacks about same to and for same. to mainstream whites it's a tight cohesion that can't but look, from outside the cultural window, like occlusion, clannishness (sic) and inbreeding, a kind of reverse snobbery about what's ""def"" and ""fresh"" and in-the-scene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college societies and wasp-only country clubs. serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or establishment, and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individuals--the great white male is rap's grand inquisitor, its idiot questioner--its alien other no less than reds were for mccarthy. the music's paranoia, together with its hermetic racial context, helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and scary.  other incongruities. rap is a ""music"" essentially without melody, built instead around a digitally synthesized drum- and back-beat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waiting-room table, enhanced by ""sampled"" (pirated) ""krush grooves"" (licks or repetitive chord-series) conceived and recorded by pre-rap rock icons, the whole affair characterized by a distinctive, spare, noisy, clattering ""style"" whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of low-i amperage around the performative circuit of the mc/rapper and his record-scratching, sound-mixing sancho panza, the dj.  the rapper (the guy in the cameo cut or kangol hat, pricey warm-up, unlaced adidas, extra thick gold chain or oversized medallion) offers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight, stressed, rhymed verse, the verse's syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboing-for-rhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from nantucket. the lyrics, nearly always self-referential, tend to be variations on about half a dozen basic themes, themes that at first listen can seem less alien or shocking than downright dull. eg: just how bad/cool/fresh/def the rapper and his lyrics are; just how equally un-all-these his music rivals are; how troublesome, vacuous and acquisitive women are; how wonderful it is to be ""paid in full"" for rapping instead of stealing or dealing; how gangs are really families, 'caine's constant bad news. and, in particular, how sex and violence and yuppie toys represent perfectly the urban black lifedrive to late-80s american glory.  the masks are many, too many for anything really but direct aural inspection: rap personae can change frequently even within single albums, the rapper delivering hard, violent black nationalist communique on one cut, dubbing against trinidadian steel drums on another, basking in big label eclat on a third, cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb, cooing to his ""bitch"" and then on the flip side, threatening to go get his gun again if she can't learn who's boss. though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face, the quintessential rap group is unquintessential, chameleonesque. this is either by weird design, or it's a symptom and symbol of 80s facelessness…or most likely, it's just a good old venerable synecdoche of rap's genre itself, one that's now moving so fast it can't quite fix on its own identity -- much less hold still for anything like cool, critical classification or assessment, from outside.  the mc's alice toklas-esque dj hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black germanness of a whole lot of digital editing & playback equipment. his responsibility is the song behind and around the rap -- the backbeat, krush groove, and the ""sound carpet,"" i.e. a kind of electric aural environment, a chaos behind the rapper's rhymed order, a digitalized blend of snippets, squeaks, screams, sirens, snatches from pop media, all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of ""samples"" that results. the most recognizable of these samples range from staccato record-scratches to james brown and funkadelic licks, to m.l.k.'s public dream, to quotidian pop pap like ""the theme from shaft,"" brady bunch dialogue, and '50s detergent commercials.  we have now read every review and essay to do with serious underground hip-hop available in every single on-line periodical ... xcept for one or two underground newsletters (viz. the city sun, fresh-est) circulated in parts of the bronx demimonde where learning about rap is as hard for white outsiders as scoring fine china white or aks. from the kind of sedulous bibliomaniacal research to be expected of conscientious lawyers and phds, the following has become clear. outside england, where the punk-weaned audience has developed a taste for spectacle-through-windows, for vicarious rage and protest against circumstances that have exactly 0% to do with them, most of what rolling stone calls ""devoted rock consumers"" (meaning we post-baby-boomers), plus almost all established rock critics, tend to regard non-crossover rap as essentially boring and simplistic, or swaggering and bellicose and dangerous--at all events, basically vapid and empty because of its obsessive self-referentiality…in short, as closed to them, to us, as a music. unrecognizable as what we've been trained and adverted to buy as pop.... great to dance to, of course, but then what might the white audience for today's mainstream expect? rap, whether fecund or sterile, is today's pop music's lone cutting edge, the new, the unfamiliar, the brain-resisted-while-body-boogies. and that resisted, alien, exhilarating cutting edge has always been black.  ""what have you left me? what have i got? last night in cold blood my young brother got shot my homey got jacked my mother's on crack my sister can't work cause her arms show tracks madness, insanity live in profanity then some punk claim that they understandin' me? give me a break--what world do you live in? death is my sex--guess my religion.""**  what makes this stuff so much more disturbing, more real to outsiders than the punk rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously? maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom: i always found it tough to listen straight-faced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit. all doctrine and pronouncement, exclusively anti-, this punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void, nothing human to grab onto. i have no idea what a punk performer thinks, feels, is, day-to-day... in fact i always suspected he had no day, but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow. can you imagine a punk with four-foot hair and spiked jacket and nose-ring, say, eating a bologna sandwich? replacing a light bulb? putting a quarter in a meter? not me, boy. and even barnum, who knew fear sells, also knew that freakshows aren't frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance. 0% affinity = 0% empathy. and fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or threat.  public enemy and n.w.a., ice t and schoolly d discomfit us, our friends, the critics we read and cornered, because the hard rappers' lyrics are conscientious about being of/for the real lives and attitudes of recognizable, if alien, persons. here's where it's a level up from mere spectacle: ideology in hard rap is always informed by incident or named condition. this makes rap not only better than punk, but way scarier. serious hard raps afford white listeners genuine, horse's-mouth access to the life-and-death plight and mood of an american community on the genuine edge of im-/explosion, an ugly new sub-nation we've been heretofore conditioned to avoid, remand to the margins, not even see except through certain carefully abstract, attenuating filters.  for outsiders, rap is hard to dissect, easy to move to. the command is: dance, don't understand; participate, don't manipulate. rap is a fortress protected by the twin moats of talk and technology. the first is that nu style of speak--the ""dialect drug,"" de la soul calls it--that rappers fashion from jive and disseminate through record stores to all of us. some in-words, like ""fly,"" meaning ""finelooking,"" have been in coin since the beginning, now venerable as old english because they turn up on grandmaster flash cuts from '82. others, like ""dead presidents,"" rap for $$, are either coming into or going out of currency, depending on when you read this. rap, a club language, has myriad ways to describe one's own or others' looks. ""fly"" is how a man digs a woman. one would never describe oneself as ""fly,"" even when cataloguing one's own attractions (done more in rap than anyplace except perhaps village voice personals). ""fresh"" means irresistibly stylish, oft-modified by ""funky,"" ""crazy,"" or ""stoopid,"" predominantly used to convey the fly-ness of things other than women, including oneself or one's rap, which two concepts rappers, like schizophrenics, can't always keep separate in their heads. ""dope"" means ""def,"" and ""def"" means crazy funky stoopid fresh. synonyms include: the shit, the it, the cool, the thang, the word, the grooviest, the categorical imperative, die weltanschung, the that-which-potter-stewart-would-know-if-he-saw. a def rapper is so style-defining as to make the stylish mere copycats. to be def is to rap to the beat of a different drum machine--not seeking solitude, but rather confident that others will follow. the def rapper mc's a def rap, which rap def-ly tells of its own (and the rapper's) def-ness--so def, as mc/manager, entrepreneur russell rush simmons brags, that it had to be on a label called def jam.  rap celebrates power, equating strength with style, and style with the ""i"" in ""individuality."" rappers ""dis""--dismiss--the styleless, faceless. to ""ill"" is to be weak or wrong; to ""bite"" is to thieve another's dope beat. and only the ill would bite.  early remastered pop was the first fake music ever, since what the record buyer of '63 experienced as aural event on his turntable couldn't happen live. rock began to become an illusion of event which technology made possible; rock became more like the movies, starting down a long road at the end of which was mtv.  not that this kept phil spector up nights. the gurus of the studio had fatter fish to clean, for the new freedom to shape sound had come at a price. with each magnetic jump from live, as tape was made of tapes which were themselves tapes of tapes, the hiss and crackle of interference multiplied. dual high-bias media with 2 units each of sonic garbage per 10,000 units of elvis presley, retaped on similar 2-units-per-10,000 tape, became 4 units of hiss; retaped, 8; then 16; then 32. as the sound got fuller, it decayed.  the solution was a breakthrough called multi-tracking--using recorders that could capture and play back on 2 (as in stereo), 4 (as in '67's then-ear-shattering sergeant pepper's lonely heart's club band), 12, 16, and today 24 parallel tracks, eliminating the hiss of transference from one machine to the next. rhythms, melodies, harmonies could all be captured on separate tracks, allowing the performer or producer to mix and listen and re-mix, adding vocals or lead instrument on yet another track. rap edisons like kool herc, grandmaster flash and afrika bambaataa began as party djs, not musicians. their wiring of twin turntables to a mixer, allowing them to ""stack"" the sound of two different records while rapping into a mike, was a kind of crude, extemporaneous multitracking. technological loops like those in the nasa-esque studios of cbs and polygram were now in the hands of the homeboys. carter was president. the bee gees, with five top-ten hits in twelve months, were king.  digital recording, the science dividing rjam's tam-tam on tape from tam-tam as heard ""live"" is a technology that converts music to codes or ""digits."" the codes are ""read"" by a computer, one combining sophisticated sound-to-code translation hardware with a number-crunching cos and a high-response synthesizer, at speeds of 40,000 digits per second and up. the recorded sounds, reduced to numbers, can be shaped, mangled, muffled, amplified, and even canonized.*** hardware then translates the digits, as read and altered, back into sound, which can itself be recorded on multitrack and combined with yet more sounds. the result: hiss-free reproduction on an infinity of tracks, each of which can itself be manipulated infinitely.  digital recording, part of the 80s sea-change in how pop gets made, divides the responsibility for the final song more or less equally between the performer, the engineer at the mixing board, the producer who coordinates the multi-tracking and mixing process, and the electronic hardware that actually ""makes"" the music we buy. the latest synthesizers**** produce notes from pure electric current instead of electronically amplified vibrations, with voltage-meters rather than hands or feet determining everything from key to pitch to timbre to ""attack-delay envelope"" (another non-rap term, denoting the microtimed, counterpoised quality of a note's duration, how a note's sound/quaver-structure as it builds is different from its sound and structure as it fades--the manipulation of a piano's foot-pedals, for example, affects the delay component of each note and chord's envelope). the kurzweil 250, a state-of-the-art system, is a 1-?track/12,018-note synthesizer linked by software to an apple macintosh plus, which serves as an exhaustive library of digitized sound. the kurzweil could put all of culture in a blender--take janet leigh's cremora-curdling scream from psycho, store it in the mac, program the synth such that an f# will be reproduced as janet leigh's f# scream, then play ""we shall overcome"" as if screamed by janet leigh; store this; treat similarly bach's st. matthew's passion, except with vast choruses of screaming janet leighs, then ""mary had a little lamb,"" then ""twist and shout"" (by the isleys, not the beatles), all as screams; then replay the four as one horrific jumble, or select amidst the jumble; and then whatever you came up with in the final, painstakingly re-mixed mix you could play backwards. and call that ""finished."" or never finish. it's like holding music at gunpoint. you can make it do--or do to you --whatever you can think of. whim is the only limit.  basically we decided we were into rap because, even media-hype aside, this music had some kind of hard edge to it. date of composition here is july '89. think back. this last has been a fiscal year in which madonna's ""back on top,"" in which covers of classic covers of classic tunes are themselves covered and then climb corporate charts, in which rod stewart's out of cryogenics and back on top.... mtv's ceased to be anything but a long commercial for itself and the interests of corporate labels; bobby mcferrin makes a platinum mint and then several commercial jingles out of a burbled synth-reggae invitation to ""be happy,"" a song that has the same verbal-pre-packaging feel as ""where's the beef?""  this last year heavy metal's fake-satanist male models accounted for 1/2 of total u.s. record sales; u2 filmed a $20,000,000 homage to their own self-righteousness and bono's ever more ill-disguised megalomania. a year when even good old rem finally went corporate-pop with green, when good old springsteen trashed his bride, when as modest and nascent a talent as tracy chapman earned cymbal-crashing critical raves for her competent, updated frappe of baez and armatrading, so desperate were pop critics and consumers for any voice at once comprehensible and even remotely fresh. just not a notable pop year at all. except in rap. rap appears in the famished late 80s as potentially a genuine musical scene the way early jazz, rock, the summer of love, folk/protest, god even the way new wave and punk were ""scenes""--the s-word here simultaneously meaning: something new to look at; something loud and upsetting (""oh please, veronica, let's not have a scene!""); and, best, an identifiable set of places in time where large forces meet, marry and beget. whether by virtue or default, rap is pretty much what there is to like right now, if you want to regard today's pop as anything more than covert jingles in 4/4-time. in our opinion.  but so the point is we enjoy it. plus we've developed some theses about why serious rap is important, both as art-for-own-sake and as a kind of metaphor-with-larynx for a subbed-culture unique in its distillation of the energy and horror of the american present.  rap is expanding gas-like through the 80s' dry time, growing from house party schtick, gang anthem, a small-label fad with the sort of pop lifespan you measure with eggtimers--then somehow, when we weren't looking, into scene, movement, on the air--finally, in the last 24 months, assuming the fecund role of genuine genre. exploding into subspecies now faster than you can track. there's now dub's mix of rap and reggae, house's mix of rap and 70s-, huge-afro'd funk, acid house's psychedelic hip-hop. there is black rap for white mass-consumption (tone loc, run?dmc), black rap for local set and -house consumption (countless local stars and wanna-be's in every large city), ultra-black rap superstars for the whole marginal nation inside (heavy d, public enemy, big daddy kane), white rap for white masses (the execrable beastie boys). there is hispanic, salsa-influenced rap out of different west coast barrios, rap fused with west indian or islamic traditional music in digital underground, eric b. and rakim, and others, or fused with oh-so-danceable r&b in the new ""jack swing"" offshoot (bobby brown, mc hammer); even gay and bohemian young urban bs have their trendsetters in teddy riley and guy, de la soul, kwabe. etc. etc.***** a major impediment to sampling this scene is the kaleidoscopic fury with which the scene itself is changing. if you're reading this in print it's already dated.  and the rap world's vitality is one of replacement as well as variety, allowing the genre to remain fresh, as band after band is seduced into the ""real"" music biz. this scene is hydra-like. almost the moment a rap artist like run-dmc or l. l. cool j ""breaks through"" into major-market mix appeal, mtv's land of corporate bankability, certain reactions within the urban underground that spawned them can almost always be observed. the breakthrough band's b-boys themselves are without qualms about the pop bigtime: after all, they've been rapping all along about their entitlement to money and status, about the inevitable rewards of their freshness and unbiteable voice. their postbreakthrough raps tend all often to become celebrations of their new wealth and fame, of the now-enhanced authority of their ""message""--though it's hard to feature public enemy rapping about a black-militant renaissance, about revolution and american apocalypse, while lily-white cbs records pays them millions for the distribution rights to just such exhortations to cut corporate throats.  nevertheless, back in the underground scene, the breakthrough band's tight set of original fans tends to hang loyal, to await feverishly ""their"" crew's spots on the same music tv they love to dis. in short, there are comparatively few of the accusations of selling out that accompanied a similarly oxymoronic coopting phenomenon in late-60s protest rock. which if you think about it, is passing strange. the white mainstream other against which serious rap aligns and defines itself makes the 60s ""establishment"" too look downright benign.  our opinion, then, from a distance: not only is a serious rap serious poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the great 80s market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we've been encouraged sadly to write off,6 it's quite possibly the most important stuff happening in american poetry today. ""real"" (viz. academic) u.s. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocab, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred and (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn't get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers, doesn't get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership (most of the moved being poets themselves), doesn't generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best phd-poets rent their names and time ... and especially does not inspire a whole culture's youth to try to follow in their connecticut-catalogue brogans' prints. because of rap's meteoric rise, though, you've got poor kids, tough kids, ""underachievers,"" a ""lost generation""... more young people--ostensibly forever turned off ""language"" by tv, video games and low u.s.d.e. budgets--more of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time, trying to put words together in striking and creative ways, than the u.s.a. has probably ever had at one time. that few of these will become ""stars"" matters far less than the grim stats about, say, the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status: the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values (and values enough to let rap-dissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing) can obviously be applied in mainstream-approved, ""productive"" ways--g.e.d.'s college, standard written english ...perhaps someday even ad-copywriting!  but is this wildfire of urban rap ambition raging around converted four-car garages like north dorchester's rjam's in spite of the genre's near-disciplinary prosodic restrictions, or because of them? can't really tell. probably doesn't matter. the fact remains that, were ""important poetry"" presently defined in terms of what makes important art important in a supply-side democracy (popularity, effect, the separation of fan from his cash), staid journals like poetry and american poetry review would be featuring some number of fade-cut, multiple-earring'd authors' photos in each issue; and highbrow public readings would always carry their back row fraction of bangers ready to ""listen rude"" to wilbur and levertov and ashbery, just as e.g rimbaud and pound did to their own contemporaries ... to the delight and invigoration of a time's poetry...  ... and even just the prospected fantasy of seeing public enemy's be-clocked flavor fav and like a jorie graham or amy clampitt sitting down over beer and celestial seasonings to hash out the debate over line-breaks in dactylic pentameter, a very serious young homeboy in italian silk and pentagonal shades serving as interpreter is enough to make us hereby officially lobby for the admission of rhyme's renaissance--at least under the stringent rhythmic demands rap has forced on rhyme-as-form--to the cold corridors of serious appreciation.  unlike the mostly docile poetry and fiction of the late 80s, though, rap's own quality, the def freshness of the mc's bit, is set up to be judged primarily in the context of what it is against. in case you thought we forgot, rap is first of all a movement in rock music, and thus the time-honored requirement is that the rap scene set itself very consciously athwart those circumstances and forces whose enormity is required by all rock 'n roll to justify one of its essential roles, rebellion-against. except now watch the objects of the rebellion alter, spread, grow in urgency--from the 50s' parents and principals, homework, hot rods, the sweet hurt of teen love, to the urban 80s, police, violent death, homelessness, the lure of ecstatic drugs that dehumanize weaponry, fatherlessness, the animal emptiness of sex w/o love, the almost trilaterally sinister white establishment (""the government's responsible the government's. . . ""), everyone else: life as a series of interruptions from an angry slumber about what the electric voices say you must have and the human voices say you may not, about the betrayal of the past, of the promises exacted by carmichael, x, and the now-formal martyrdom of king.  segregation may affect their hearts and minds, earl warren warned, as malcolm x and louis farrakhan, both alumni of boston's old separate-but-awful schools, bear loud witness. now, 40 years after x disgustedly quit a racist high school and began a career as a kind of be-bop gang-banger, 35 years after brown v. board of education invented integration, 15 years after morgan v. hennigan brought brown to boston, north dorchester is worse and its schools aren't better. a former united states secretary of education converts to drug czar, symbolizing a national change of mind: now drugs, not poor schools (and certainly not the american apartheid of which segregated schools were but one facet), is our root ""innercity"" problem. tam-tam's boston is strangely less hopeful than the notoriously segregated pre-hennigan city, perhaps because before hennigan reformers could promise that segregation was why things were so bad. segregation was blame's bullseye: abolish the bullseye, and blame for the estrangement of the races flies everywhere, hitting the cops, or the courts, or the teachers, or the taught, or what's taught. there's even a rap--b.d.p.'s ""why is that?""--blaming our miseries on the failure of the schools to ""teach black kids to be black.""  but everything the white rock listener pays to enjoy is black-begotten. if today's top?40 environment seems bleak or befouled, imagine the present mainstream without its sweetest sourcewaters, without the king-waters-king blues trinity, the brownian soul, the backbeat, cut time, blue notes, funky french curves of sax and brass, the guitar solo, call-and-response, the cold medina or lucky powder, those lithely syncopated quintets in pomade and linen suits, the single hand in the white glove holding pepsi aloft in the shadow of accidental flames.... black music is american pop's breath and bread; and we, as both born audience and born salesmen, know it.  so maybe it's them. them. maybe we're approaching an enforced fork in the musical road where the white-run entertainment industry will have to pack up what it's taken and go seek its fortune on the backs of new minorities. maybe, in serious rap, the extreme new insulation of the black sound is not only intentional but preplanned, part of a neo-nationalist agenda, the hermetic new scene's tight circle more like something large and coiled than something small and flat.  you may now be getting some hazy idea of the sorts of really quite scary possibilities with which the rap we like is replete. and, hazier, of how complicated this stuff of sampler-from-outside can be. what's remained passing strange, for use, is the vague threat's appeal. the unease and ambivalence with which the rare white at the window loves rap renders that love no less love. whence the fear, though, is really no matter. for look at the world, at the masses we're part of. at what you look at closest. the plain 80s data is that, whereas love, devotion, passion seem only to divide, it's fear and strangeness that bind crowds, fill halls, unite us, somehow, as audience, under the great tent.  *'hip-hop' is an older synonym, coined by rap pioneer, kool herc, to describe the heavily danceable jamaican scatting he introduced between records at the huge south bronx block parties he and other new-scene celebrities, like jazzy five and former black spades leader, afrika bambaataa, could turn into late-70s frenzies of breakdance (both music and dance a self-conscious reaction against the glittered unreality of downtown disco).  **except but now hey kids! thanks to at&t you can now speak directly to ice t and hear his philosophy of life by phone! 1-900-907-9111.

"mccutcheon v. federal election commission lyricsthere is no right more basic in our democracy than the right to participate in electing our political leaders. citizens can exercise that right in a variety of ways: they can run for office themselves, vote, urge others to vote for a particular candidate, volunteer to work on a campaign, and contribute to a candidate's campaign. this case is about the last of those options.  the right to participate in democracy through political contributions is protected by the first amendment, but that right is not absolute. our cases have held that congress may regulate campaign contributions to protect against corruption or the appearance of corruption. see, e.g., buckley v. valeo, 424 u. s. 1, 26-27 (1976) (per curiam). at the same time, we have made clear that congress may not regulate contributions simply to reduce the amount of money in politics, or to restrict the political participation of some in order to enhance the relative influence of others. see, e.g., arizona free enterprise club's freedom club pac v. bennett, 564 u. s. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 24-25).  many people might find those latter objectives attractive: they would be delighted to see fewer television commercials touting a candidate's accomplishments or disparaging an opponent's character. money in politics may at times seem repugnant to some, but so too does much of what the first amendment vigorously protects. if the first amendment protects flag burning, funeral protests, and nazi parades—despite the profound offense such spectacles cause—it surely protects political campaign speech despite popular opposition. see texas v. johnson, 491 u. s. 397 (1989); snyder v. phelps, 562 u. s. ___ (2011); national socialist party of america v. skokie, 432 u. s. 43 (1977) (per curiam). indeed, as we have emphasized, the first amendment ""has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office."" monitor patriot co. v. roy, 401 u. s. 265, 272 (1971).  in a series of cases over the past 40 years, we have spelled out how to draw the constitutional line between the permissible goal of avoiding corruption in the political process and the impermissible desire simply to limit political speech. we have said that government regulation may not target the general gratitude a candidate may feel toward those who support him or his allies, or the political access such support may afford. ""ingratiation and access. . . are not corruption."" citizens united v. federal election comm'n, 558 u. s. 310, 360 (2010). they embody a central feature of democracy—that constituents support candidates who share their beliefs and interests, and candidates who are elected can be expected to be responsive to those concerns.  any regulation must instead target what we have called ""quid pro quo"" corruption or its appearance. see id., at 359. that latin phrase captures the notion of a direct exchange of an official act for money. see mccormick v. united states, 500 u. s. 257, 266 (1991). ""the hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for political favors."" federal election comm'n v. national conservative political action comm., 470 u. s. 480, 497 (1985). campaign finance restrictions that pursue other objectives, we have explained, impermissibly inject the government ""into the debate over who should govern."" bennett, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 25). and those who govern should be the last people to help decide who should govern.  the statute at issue in this case imposes two types of limits on campaign contributions. the first, called base limits, restricts how much money a donor may contribute to a particular candidate or committee. 2 u. s. c. §441a(a)(1). the second, called aggregate limits, restricts how much money a donor may contribute in total to all candidates or committees. §441a(a)(3). this case does not involve any challenge to the base limits, which we have previously upheld as serving the permissible objective of combatting corruption. the government contends that the aggregate limits also serve that objective, by preventing circumvention of the base limits. we conclude, however, that the aggregate limits do little, if anything, to address that concern, while seriously restricting participation in the democratic process. the aggregate limits are therefore invalid under the first amendment.  i  a  for the 2013-2014 election cycle, the base limits in the federal election campaign act of 1971 (feca), as amended by the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 (bcra), permit an individual to contribute up to $2,600 per election to a candidate ($5,200 total for the primary and general elections); $32,400 per year to a national party committee;  $10,000 per year to a state or local party committee; and $5,000 per year to a political action committee, or ""pac."" 2 u. s. c. §441a(a)(1); 78 fed. reg. 8532 (2013).  a national committee, state or local party committee, or multicandidate pac may in turn contribute up to $5,000 per election to a candidate. §441a(a)(2).   the base limits apply with equal force to contributions that are ""in any way earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary or conduit"" to a candidate. §441a(a)(8). if, for example, a donor gives money to a party committee but directs the party committee to pass the contribution along to a particular candidate, then the transaction is treated as a contribution from the original donor to the specified candidate.  for the 2013-2014 election cycle, the aggregate limits in bcra permit an individual to contribute a total of $48,600 to federal candidates and a total of $74,600 to other political committees. of that $74,600, only $48,600 may be contributed to state or local party committees and pacs, as opposed to national party committees. §441a(a)(3); 78 fed. reg. 8532. all told, an individual may contribute up to $123,200 to candidate and noncandidate committees during each two-year election cycle.  the base limits thus restrict how much money a donor may contribute to any particular candidate or committee; the aggregate limits have the effect of restricting how many candidates or committees the donor may support, to the extent permitted by the base limits.  b  in the 2011-2012 election cycle, appellant shaun mccutcheon contributed a total of $33,088 to 16 different federal candidates, in compliance with the base limits applicable to each. he alleges that he wished to contribute $1,776 to each of 12 additional candidates but was prevented from doing so by the aggregate limit on contributions to candidates. mccutcheon also contributed a total of $27,328 to several noncandidate political committees, in compliance with the base limits applicable to each. he alleges that he wished to contribute to various other political committees, including $25,000 to each of the three republican national party committees, but was prevented from doing so by the aggregate limit on contributions to political committees. mccutcheon further alleges that he plans to make similar contributions in the future. in the 2013-2014 election cycle, he again wishes to contribute at least $60,000 to various candidates and $75,000 to non-candidate political committees. brief for appellant mccutcheon 11-12.  appellant republican national committee is a national political party committee charged with the general management of the republican party. the rnc wishes to receive the contributions that mccutcheon and similarly situated individuals would like to make—contributions otherwise permissible under the base limits for national party committees but foreclosed by the aggregate limit on contributions to political committees.  in june 2012, mccutcheon and the rnc filed a complaint before a three-judge panel of the u. s. district court for the district of columbia. see bcra §403(a), 116 stat. 113-114. mccutcheon and the rnc asserted that the aggregate limits on contributions to candidates and to noncandidate political committees were unconstitutional under the first amendment. they moved for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the challenged provisions, and the government moved to dismiss the case.  the three-judge district court denied appellants' motion for a preliminary injunction and granted the government's motion to dismiss. assuming that the base limits appropriately served the government's anticorruption interest, the district court concluded that the aggregate limits survived first amendment scrutiny because they prevented evasion of the base limits. 893 f. supp. 2d 133, 140 (2012).  in particular, the district court imagined a hypothetical scenario that might occur in a world without aggregate limits. a single donor might contribute the maximum amount under the base limits to nearly 50 separate committees, each of which might then transfer the money to the same single committee. ibid. that committee, in turn, might use all the transferred money for coordinated expenditures on behalf of a particular candidate, allowing the single donor to circumvent the base limit on the amount he may contribute to that candidate. ibid. the district court acknowledged that ""it may seem unlikely that so many separate entities would willingly serve as conduits"" for the single donor's interests, but it concluded that such a scenario ""is not hard to imagine."" ibid. it thus rejected a constitutional challenge to the aggregate limits, characterizing the base limits and the aggregate limits ""as a coherent system rather than merely a collection of individual limits stacking prophylaxis upon prophylaxis."" ibid. mccutcheon and the rnc appealed directly to this court, as authorized by law. 28 u. s. c. §1253. in such a case, ""we ha  no discretion to refuse adjudication of the case on its merits,"" hicks v. miranda, 422 u. s. 332, 344 (1975), and accordingly we noted probable jurisdiction. 568 u. s. ___ (2013).  ii  a  buckley v. valeo, 424 u. s. 1, presented this court with its first opportunity to evaluate the constitutionality of the original contribution and expenditure limits set forth in feca. feca imposed a $1,000 per election base limit on contributions from an individual to a federal candidate. it also imposed a $25,000 per year aggregate limit on all contributions from an individual to candidates or political committees. 18 u. s. c. §§608(b)(1), 608(b)(3) (1970 ed., supp. iv). on the expenditures side, feca imposed limits on both independent expenditures and candidates' overall campaign expenditures. §§608(e)(1), 608(c).  buckley recognized that ""contribution and expenditure limitations operate in an area of the most fundamental first amendment activities."" 424 u. s., at 14. but it distinguished expenditure limits from contribution limits based on the degree to which each encroaches upon protected first amendment interests. expenditure limits, the court explained, ""necessarily reduce  the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached."" id., at 19. the court thus subjected expenditure limits to ""the exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations on core first amendment rights of political expression."" id., at 44-45. under exacting scrutiny, the government may regulate protected speech only if such regulation promotes a compelling interest and is the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest. see sable communications of cal., inc. v. fcc, 492 u. s. 115, 126 (1989).  by contrast, the court concluded that contribution limits impose a lesser restraint on political speech because they ""permit  the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but do  not in any way infringe the contributor's freedom to discuss candidates and issues."" buckley, 424 u. s., at 21. as a result, the court focused on the effect of the contribution limits on the freedom of political association and applied a lesser but still ""rigorous standard of review."" id., at 29. under that standard, "" ven a `""significant interference"" with protected rights of political association' may be sustained if the state demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgement of associational freedoms."" id., at 25 (quoting cousins v. wigoda, 419 u. s. 477, 488 (1975)).  the primary purpose of feca was to limit quid pro quo corruption and its appearance; that purpose satisfied the requirement of a ""sufficiently important"" governmental interest. 424 u. s., at 26-27. as for the ""closely drawn"" component, buckley concluded that the $1,000 base limit ""focuses precisely on the problem of large campaign contributions. . . while leaving persons free to engage in independent political expression, to associate actively through volunteering their services, and to assist to a limited but nonetheless substantial extent in supporting candidates and committees with financial resources."" id., at 28. the court therefore upheld the $1,000 base limit under the ""closely drawn"" test. id., at 29.  the court next separately considered an overbreadth challenge to the base limit. see id., at 29-30. the challengers argued that the base limit was fatally overbroad because most large donors do not seek improper influence over legislators' actions. although the court accepted that premise, it nevertheless rejected the overbreadth challenge for two reasons: first, it was too ""difficult to isolate suspect contributions"" based on a contributor's subjective intent. id., at 30. second, ""congress was justified in concluding that the interest in safeguarding against the appearance of impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent in the process of raising large monetary contributions be eliminated."" ibid.  finally, in one paragraph of its 139-page opinion, the court turned to the $25,000 aggregate limit under feca. as a preliminary matter, it noted that the constitutionality of the aggregate limit ""ha  not been separately addressed at length by the parties."" id., at 38. then, in three sentences, the court disposed of any constitutional objections to the aggregate limit that the challengers might have had:  ""the overall $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candidates and committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of financial support. but this quite modest restraint upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate, or huge contributions to the candidate's political party. the limited, additional restriction on associational freedom imposed by the overall ceiling is thus no more than a corollary of the basic individual contribution limitation that we have found to be constitutionally valid."" ibid. b  1  the parties and amici curiae spend significant energy debating whether the line that buckley drew between contributions and expenditures should remain the law. notwithstanding the robust debate, we see no need in this case to revisit buckley's distinction between contributions and expenditures and the corollary distinction in the applicable standards of review. buckley held that the government's interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance was ""sufficiently important,"" id., at 26-27; we have elsewhere stated that the same interest may properly be labeled ""compelling,"" see national conservative political action comm., 470 u. s., at 496-497, so that the interest would satisfy even strict scrutiny. moreover, regardless whether we apply strict scrutiny or buckley's ""closely drawn"" test, we must assess the fit between the stated governmental objective and the means selected to achieve that objective. see, e.g., national conservative political action comm., supra, at 496-501; randall v. sorrell, 548 u. s. 230, 253-262 (2006) (opinion of breyer, j.). or to put it another way, if a law that restricts political speech does not ""avoid unnecessary abridgement"" of first amendment rights, buckley, 424 u. s., at 25, it cannot survive ""rigorous"" review.  because we find a substantial mismatch between the government's stated objective and the means selected to achieve it, the aggregate limits fail even under the ""closely drawn"" test. we therefore need not parse the differences between the two standards in this case. 2  buckley treated the constitutionality of the $25,000 aggregate limit as contingent upon that limit's ability to prevent circumvention of the $1,000 base limit, describing the aggregate limit as ""no more than a corollary"" of the base limit. id., at 38. the court determined that circumvention could occur when an individual legally contributes ""massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions"" to entities that are themselves likely to contribute to the candidate. ibid. for that reason, the court upheld the $25,000 aggregate limit.  although buckley provides some guidance, we think that its ultimate conclusion about the constitutionality of the aggregate limit in place under feca does not control here. buckley spent a total of three sentences analyzing that limit; in fact, the opinion pointed out that the constitutionality of the aggregate limit ""ha  not been separately addressed at length by the parties."" ibid. we are now asked to address appellants' direct challenge to the aggregate limits in place under bcra. bcra is a different statutory regime, and the aggregate limits it imposes operate against a distinct legal backdrop.  most notably, statutory safeguards against circumvention have been considerably strengthened since buckley was decided, through both statutory additions and the introduction of a comprehensive regulatory scheme. with more targeted anticircumvention measures in place today, the indiscriminate aggregate limits under bcra appear particularly heavy-handed.  the 1976 feca amendments, for example, added another layer of base contribution limits. the 1974 version of feca had already capped contributions from political committees to candidates, but the 1976 version added limits on contributions to political committees. this change was enacted at least ""in part to prevent circumvention of the very limitations on contributions that this court upheld in buckley."" california medical assn. v. federal election comm'n, 453 u. s. 182, 197-198 (1981) (plurality opinion); see also id., at 203 (blackmun, j., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). because a donor's contributions to a political committee are now limited, a donor cannot flood the committee with ""huge"" amounts of money so that each contribution the committee makes is perceived as a contribution from him. buckley, supra, at 38. rather, the donor may contribute only $5,000 to the committee, which hardly raises the specter of abuse that concerned the court in buckley. limits on contributions to political committees consequently create an additional hurdle for a donor who seeks both to channel a large amount of money to a particular candidate and to ensure that he gets the credit for doing so.  the 1976 amendments also added an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees. see 2 u. s. c. §441a(a)(5); 11 cfr §100.5(g)(4). the government acknowledges that this antiproliferation rule ""forecloses what would otherwise be a particularly easy and effective means of circumventing the limits on contributions to any particular political committee."" brief for appellee 46. in effect, the rule eliminates a donor's ability to create and use his own political committees to direct funds in excess of the individual base limits. it thus blocks a straightforward method of achieving the circumvention that was the underlying concern in buckley.  the intricate regulatory scheme that the federal election commission has enacted since buckley further limits the opportunities for circumvention of the base limits via ""unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute"" to a particular candidate. 424 u. s., at 38. although the earmarking provision, 2 u. s. c. §441a(a)(8), was in place when buckley was decided, the fec has since added regulations that define earmarking broadly. for example, the regulations construe earmarking to include any designation, ""whether direct or indirect, express or implied, oral or written."" 11 cfr §110.6(b)(1). the regulations specify that an individual who has contributed to a particular candidate may not also contribute to a single-candidate committee for that candidate. §110.1(h)(1). nor may an individual who has contributed to a candidate also contribute to a political committee that has supported or anticipates supporting the same candidate, if the individual knows that ""a substantial portion   will be contributed to, or expended on behalf of,"" that candidate. §110.1(h)(2).  in addition to accounting for statutory and regulatory changes in the campaign finance arena, appellants' challenge raises distinct legal arguments that buckley did not consider. for example, presumably because of its cursory treatment of the $25,000 aggregate limit, buckley did not separately address an overbreadth challenge with respect to that provision. the court rejected such a challenge to the base limits because of the difficulty of isolating suspect contributions. the propriety of large contributions to individual candidates turned on the subjective intent of donors, and the court concluded that there was no way to tell which donors sought improper influence over legislators' actions. see 424 u. s., at 30. the aggregate limit, on the other hand, was upheld as an anticircumvention measure, without considering whether it was possible to discern which donations might be used to circumvent the base limits. see id., at 38. the court never addressed overbreadth in the specific context of aggregate limits, where such an argument has far more force.  given the foregoing, this case cannot be resolved merely by pointing to three sentences in buckley that were written without the benefit of full briefing or argument on the issue. see toucey v. new york life ins. co., 314 u. s. 118, 139-140 (1941) (departing from "" oose language and a sporadic, ill-considered decision"" when asked to resolve a question ""with our eyes wide open and in the light of full consideration""); hohn v. united states, 524 u. s. 236, 251 (1998) (departing from a prior decision where it ""was rendered without full briefing or argument""). we are confronted with a different statute and different legal arguments, at a different point in the development of campaign finance regulation. appellants' substantial first amendment challenge to the system of aggregate limits currently in place thus merits our plenary consideration.   iii  the first amendment ""is designed and intended to remove governmental restraints from the arena of public discussion, putting the decision as to what views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us, . . . in the belief that no other approach would comport with the premise of individual dignity and choice upon which our political system rests."" cohen v. california, 403 u. s. 15, 24 (1971). as relevant here, the first amendment safeguards an individual's right to participate in the public debate through political expression and political association. see buckley, 424 u. s., at 15. when an individual contributes money to a candidate, he exercises both of those rights: the contribution ""serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views"" and ""serves to affiliate a person with a candidate."" id., at 21-22.  those first amendment rights are important regardless whether the individual is, on the one hand, a ""lone pamphleteer  or street corner orator  in the tom paine mold,"" or is, on the other, someone who spends ""substantial amounts of money in order to communicate   political ideas through sophisticated"" means. national conservative political action comm., 470 u. s., at 493. either way, he is participating in an electoral debate that we have recognized is ""integral to the operation of the system of government established by our constitution."" buckley, supra, at 14.  buckley acknowledged that aggregate limits at least diminish an individual's right of political association. as the court explained, the ""overall $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candidates and committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of financial support."" 424 u. s., at 38. but the court characterized that restriction as a ""quite modest restraint upon protected political activity."" ibid. we cannot agree with that characterization. an aggregate limit on how many candidates and committees an individual may support through contributions is not a ""modest restraint"" at all. the government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.  to put it in the simplest terms, the aggregate limits prohibit an individual from fully contributing to the primary and general election campaigns of ten or more candidates, even if all contributions fall within the base limits congress views as adequate to protect against corruption. the individual may give up to $5,200 each to nine candidates, but the aggregate limits constitute an outright ban on further contributions to any other candidate (beyond the additional $1,800 that may be spent before reaching the $48,600 aggregate limit). at that point, the limits deny the individual all ability to exercise his expressive and associational rights by contributing to someone who will advocate for his policy preferences. a donor must limit the number of candidates he supports, and may have to choose which of several policy concerns he will advance—clear first amendment harms that the dissent never acknowledges.  it is no answer to say that the individual can simply contribute less money to more people. to require one person to contribute at lower levels than others because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to impose a special burden on broader participation in the democratic process. and as we have recently admonished, the government may not penalize an individual for ""robustly exercis "" his first amendment rights. davis v. federal election comm'n, 554 u. s. 724, 739 (2008).  the first amendment burden is especially great for individuals who do not have ready access to alternative avenues for supporting their preferred politicians and policies. in the context of base contribution limits, buckley observed that a supporter could vindicate his associational interests by personally volunteering his time and energy on behalf of a candidate. see 424 u. s., at 22, 28. such personal volunteering is not a realistic alternative for those who wish to support a wide variety of candidates or causes. other effective methods of supporting preferred candidates or causes without contributing money are reserved for a select few, such as entertainers capable of raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single evening. cf. davis, supra, at 742.   the dissent faults this focus on ""the individual's right to engage in political speech,"" saying that it fails to take into account ""the public's interest"" in ""collective speech."" post, at 6 (opinion of breyer, j). this ""collective"" interest is said to promote ""a government where laws reflect the very thoughts, views, ideas, and sentiments, the expression of which the first amendment protects."" post, at 7.  but there are compelling reasons not to define the boundaries of the first amendment by reference to such a generalized conception of the public good. first, the dissent's ""collective speech"" reflected in laws is of course the will of the majority, and plainly can include laws that restrict free speech. the whole point of the first amendment is to afford individuals protection against such infringements. the first amendment does not protect the government, even when the government purports to act through legislation reflecting ""collective speech."" cf. united states v. alvarez, 567 u. s. ___ (2012); wooley v. maynard, 430 u. s. 705 (1977); west virginia bd. of ed. v. barnette, 319 u. s. 624 (1943).  second, the degree to which speech is protected cannot turn on a legislative or judicial determination that particular speech is useful to the democratic process. the first amendment does not contemplate such ""ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits."" united states v. stevens, 559 u. s. 460, 470 (2010); see also united states v. playboy entertainment group, inc., 529 u. s. 803, 818 (2000) (""what the constitution says is that"" value judgments ""are for the individual to make, not for the government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority"").  third, our established first amendment analysis already takes account of any ""collective"" interest that may justify restrictions on individual speech. under that accepted analysis, such restrictions are measured against the asserted public interest (usually framed as an important or compelling governmental interest). as explained below, we do not doubt the compelling nature of the ""collective"" interest in preventing corruption in the electoral process. but we permit congress to pursue that interest only so long as it does not unnecessarily infringe an individual's right to freedom of speech; we do not truncate this tailoring test at the outset.  iv  a  with the significant first amendment costs for individual citizens in mind, we turn to the governmental interests asserted in this case. this court has identified only one legitimate governmental interest for restricting campaign finances: preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption. see davis, supra, at 741; national conservative political action comm., 470 u. s., at 496-497. we have consistently rejected attempts to suppress campaign speech based on other legislative objectives. no matter how desirable it may seem, it is not an acceptable governmental objective to ""level the playing field,"" or to ""level electoral opportunities,"" or to ""equaliz  the financial resources of candidates."" bennett, 564 u. s., at ___ (slip op., at 22-23); davis, supra, at 741-742; buckley, supra, at 56. the first amendment prohibits such legislative attempts to ""fine-tun "" the electoral process, no matter how well intentioned. bennett, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 21).  as we framed the relevant principle in buckley, ""the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment."" 424 u. s., at 48-49. the dissent's suggestion that buckley supports the opposite proposition, see post, at 6, simply ignores what buckley actually said on the matter. see also citizens against rent control/coalition for fair housing v. berkeley, 454 u. s. 290, 295 (1981) (""buckley. . . made clear that contributors cannot be protected from the possibility that others will make larger contributions"").  moreover, while preventing corruption or its appearance is a legitimate objective, congress may target only a specific type of corruption—""quid pro quo"" corruption. as buckley explained, congress may permissibly seek to rein in ""large contributions   are given to secure a political quid pro quo from current and potential office holders."" 424 u. s., at 26. in addition to ""actual quid pro quo arrangements,"" congress may permissibly limit ""the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions"" to particular candidates. id., at 27; see also citizens united, 558 u. s., at 359 (""when buckley identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited to quid pro quo corruption"").  spending large sums of money in connection with elections, but not in connection with an effort to control the exercise of an officeholder's official duties, does not give rise to such quid pro quo corruption. nor does the possibility that an individual who spends large sums may garner ""influence over or access to"" elected officials or political parties. id., at 359; see mcconnell v. federal election comm'n, 540 u. s. 93, 297 (2003) (kennedy, j., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). and because the government's interest in preventing the appearance of corruption is equally confined to the appearance of quid pro quo corruption, the government may not seek to limit the appearance of mere influence or access. see citizens united, 558 u. s., at 360.  the dissent advocates a broader conception of corruption, and would apply the label to any individual contributions above limits deemed necessary to protect ""collective speech."" thus, under the dissent's view, it is perfectly fine to contribute $5,200 to nine candidates but somehow corrupt to give the same amount to a tenth.  it is fair to say, as justice stevens has, ""that we have not always spoken about corruption in a clear or consistent voice."" id., at 447 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). the definition of corruption that we apply today, however, has firm roots in buckley itself. the court in that case upheld base contribution limits because they targeted ""the danger of actual quid pro quo arrangements"" and ""the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness"" of such a system of unchecked direct contributions. 424 u. s., at 27. buckley simultaneously rejected limits on spending that was less likely to ""be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate."" id., at 47. in any event, this case is not the first in which the debate over the proper breadth of the government's anticorruption interest has been engaged. compare citizens united, 558 u. s., at 356-361 (majority opinion), with id., at 447-460 (opinion of stevens, j.).  the line between quid pro quo corruption and general influence may seem vague at times, but the distinction must be respected in order to safeguard basic first amendment rights. in addition, "" n drawing that line, the first amendment requires us to err on the side of protecting political speech rather than suppressing it."" federal election comm'n v. wisconsin right to life, 551 u. s. 449, 457 (2007) (opinion of roberts, c. j.).  the dissent laments that our opinion leaves only remnants of feca and bcra that are inadequate to combat corruption. see post, at 2. such rhetoric ignores the fact that we leave the base limits undisturbed.  those base limits remain the primary means of regulating campaign contributions—the obvious explanation for why the aggregate limits received a scant few sentences of attention in buckley.   b  ""when the government restricts speech, the government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of its actions."" united states v. playboy entertainment group, inc., 529 u. s., at 816. here, the government seeks to carry that burden by arguing that the aggregate limits further the permissible objective of preventing quid pro quo corruption.  the difficulty is that once the aggregate limits kick in, they ban all contributions of any amount. but congress's selection of a $5,200 base limit indicates its belief that contributions of that amount or less do not create a cognizable risk of corruption. if there is no corruption concern in giving nine candidates up to $5,200 each, it is difficult to understand how a tenth candidate can be regarded as corruptible if given $1,801, and all others corruptible if given a dime. and if there is no risk that additional candidates will be corrupted by donations of up to $5,200, then the government must defend the aggregate limits by demonstrating that they prevent circumvention of the base limits.  the problem is that they do not serve that function in any meaningful way. in light of the various statutes and regulations currently in effect, buckley's fear that an individual might ""contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions"" to entities likely to support the candidate, 424 u. s., at 38, is far too speculative. and— importantly—we ""have never accepted mere conjecture as adequate to carry a first amendment burden."" nixon v. shrink missouri government pac, 528 u. s. 377, 392 (2000).  as an initial matter, there is not the same risk of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance when money flows through independent actors to a candidate, as when a donor contributes to a candidate directly. when an individual contributes to a candidate, a party committee, or a pac, the individual must by law cede control over the funds. see 2 u. s. c. §441a(a)(8); 11 cfr §110.6. the government admits that if the funds are subsequently rerouted to a particular candidate, such action occurs at the initial recipient's discretion—not the donor's. see brief for appellee 37. as a consequence, the chain of attribution grows longer, and any credit must be shared among the various actors along the way. for those reasons, the risk of quid pro quo corruption is generally applicable only to ""the narrow category of money gifts that are directed, in some manner, to a candidate or officeholder."" mcconnell, 540 u. s., at 310 (opinion of kennedy, j.).  buckley nonetheless focused on the possibility that ""unearmarked contributions"" could eventually find their way to a candidate's coffers. 424 u. s., at 38. even accepting the validity of buckley's circumvention theory, it is hard to see how a candidate today could receive a ""massive amount  of money"" that could be traced back to a particular contributor uninhibited by the aggregate limits. ibid. the government offers a series of scenarios in support of that possibility. but each is sufficiently implausible that the government has not carried its burden of demonstrating that the aggregate limits further its anticircumvention interest.  the primary example of circumvention, in one form or another, envisions an individual donor who contributes the maximum amount under the base limits to a particular candidate, say, representative smith. then the donor also channels ""massive amounts of money"" to smith through a series of contributions to pacs that have stated their intention to support smith. see, e.g., brief for appellee 35-37; tr. of oral arg. 4, 6.  various earmarking and antiproliferation rules disarm this example. importantly, the donor may not contribute to the most obvious pacs: those that support only smith. see 11 cfr §110.1(h)(1); see also §102.14(a). nor may the donor contribute to the slightly less obvious pacs that he knows will route ""a substantial portion"" of his contribution to smith. §110.1(h)(2).  the donor must instead turn to other pacs that are likely to give to smith. when he does so, however, he discovers that his contribution will be significantly diluted by all the contributions from others to the same pacs. after all, the donor cannot give more than $5,000 to a pac and so cannot dominate the pac's total receipts, as he could when buckley was decided. 2 u. s. c. §441a(a)(1)(c). he cannot retain control over his contribution, 11 cfr §110.1(h)(3), direct his money ""in any way"" to smith, 2 u. s. c. §441a(a)(8), or even imply that he would like his money to be recontributed to smith, 11 cfr §110.6(b)(1). his salience as a smith supporter has been diminished, and with it the potential for corruption.  it is not clear how many candidates a pac must support before our dedicated donor can avoid being tagged with the impermissible knowledge that ""a substantial portion"" of his contribution will go to smith. but imagine that the donor is one of ten equal donors to a pac that gives the highest possible contribution to smith.  the pac may give no more than $2,600 per election to smith. of that sum, just $260 will be attributable to the donor intent on circumventing the base limits. thus far he has hardly succeeded in funneling ""massive amounts of money"" to smith. buckley, supra, at 38.  but what if this donor does the same thing via, say, 100 different pacs? his $260 contribution will balloon to $26,000, ten times what he may contribute directly to smith in any given election.  this 100-pac scenario is highly implausible. in the first instance, it is not true that the individual donor will necessarily have access to a sufficient number of pacs to effectuate such a scheme. there are many pacs, but they are not limitless. for the 2012 election cycle, the fec reported about 2,700 nonconnected pacs (excluding pacs that finance independent expenditures only). and not every pac that supports smith will work in this scheme: for our donor's pro rata share of a pac's contribution to smith to remain meaningful, the pac must be funded by only a small handful of donors. the antiproliferation rules, which were not in effect when buckley was decided, prohibit our donor from creating 100 pro-smith pacs of his own, or collaborating with the nine other donors to do so. see 2 u. s. c. §441a(a)(5) (""all contributions made by political committees established or financed or maintained or controlled by . . . any other person, or by any group of such persons, shall be considered to have been made by a single political committee"").  moreover, if 100 pacs were to contribute to smith and few other candidates, and if specific individuals like our ardent smith supporter were to contribute to each, the fec could weigh those ""circumstantial factors"" to determine whether to deem the pacs affiliated. 11 cfr §100.5(g)(4)(ii). the fec's analysis could take account of a ""common or overlapping membership"" and ""similar patterns of contributions or contributors,"" among other considerations. §§100.5(g)(4)(ii)(d), (j). the fec has in the past initiated enforcement proceedings against contributors with such suspicious patterns of pac donations. see, e.g., conciliation agreement, in re riley, matters under review 4568, 4633, 4634, 4736 (fec, dec. 19, 2001).  on a more basic level, it is hard to believe that a rational actor would engage in such machinations. in the example described, a dedicated donor spent $500,000—donating the full $5,000 to 100 different pacs—to add just $26,000 to smith's campaign coffers. that same donor, meanwhile, could have spent unlimited funds on independent expenditures on behalf of smith. see buckley, 424 u. s., at 44-51. indeed, he could have spent his entire $500,000 advocating for smith, without the risk that his selected pacs would choose not to give to smith, or that he would have to share credit with other contributors to the pacs.  we have said in the context of independent expenditures that ""` he absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent . . . undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate.'"" citizens united, 558 u. s., at 357 (quoting buckley, supra, at 47). but probably not by 95 percent. and at least from the donor's point of view, it strikes us as far more likely that he will want to see his full $500,000 spent on behalf of his favored candidate—even if it must be spent independently—rather than see it diluted to a small fraction so that it can be contributed directly by someone else.   another circumvention example is the one that apparently motivated the district court. as the district court crafted the example, a donor gives a $500,000 check to a joint fundraising committee composed of a candidate, a national party committee, and ""most of the party's state party committees"" (actually, 47 of the 50). 893 f. supp. 2d, at 140. the committees divide up the money so that each one receives the maximum contribution permissible under the base limits, but then each transfers its allocated portion to the same single committee. that committee uses the money for coordinated expenditures on behalf of a particular candidate. if that scenario ""seem  unlikely,"" the district court thought so, too. ibid. but because the district court could ""imagine"" that chain of events, it held that the example substantiated the government's circumvention concerns. ibid.  one problem, however, is that the district court's speculation relies on illegal earmarking. lest there be any confusion, a joint fundraising committee is simply a mechanism for individual committees to raise funds collectively, not to circumvent base limits or earmarking rules. see 11 cfr §102.17(c)(5). under no circumstances may a contribution to a joint fundraising committee result in an allocation that exceeds the contribution limits applicable to its constituent parts; the committee is in fact required to return any excess funds to the contributor. see §102.17(c)(6)(i).  the district court assumed compliance with the specific allocation rules governing joint fundraising committees, but it expressly based its example on the premise that the donor would telegraph his desire to support one candidate and that ""many separate entities would willingly serve as conduits for a single contributor's interests."" 893 f. supp. 2d, at 140. regardless whether so many distinct entities would cooperate as a practical matter, the earmarking provision prohibits an individual from directing funds ""through an intermediary or conduit"" to a particular candidate. 2 u. s. c. §441a(8). even the ""implicit "" agreement imagined by the district court, 893 f. supp. 2d, at 140, would trigger the earmarking provision. see 11 cfr §110.6(b)(1). so this circumvention scenario could not succeed without assuming that nearly 50 separate party committees would engage in a transparent violation of the earmarking rules (and that they would not be caught if they did).  moreover, the district court failed to acknowledge that its $500,000 example cannot apply to most candidates. it crafted the example around a presidential candidate, for whom donations in the thousands of dollars may not seem remarkable—especially in comparison to the nearly $1.4 billion spent by the 2012 presidential candidates. the same example cannot, however, be extrapolated to most house and senate candidates. like contributions, coordinated expenditures are limited by statute, with different limits based on the state and the office. see 2 u. s. c. §441a(d)(3). the 2013 coordinated expenditure limit for most house races is $46,600, well below the $500,000 in coordinated expenditures envisioned by the district court. the limit for senate races varies significantly based on state population. see 78 fed. reg. 8531 (2013). a scheme of the magnitude imagined by the district court would be possible even in theory for no house candidates and the senate candidates from just the 12 most populous states. ibid.  further, to the extent that the law does not foreclose the scenario described by the district court, experience and common sense do. the government provides no reason to believe that many state parties would willingly participate in a scheme to funnel money to another state's candidates. a review of fec data of republican and democratic state party committees for the 2012 election cycle reveals just 12 total instances in which a state party committee contributed to a house or senate candidate in another state. no surprise there. the iowa democratic party, for example, has little reason to transfer money to the california democratic party, especially when the iowa democratic party would be barred for the remainder of the election cycle from receiving another contribution for its own activities from the particular donor.  these scenarios, along with others that have been suggested, are either illegal under current campaign finance laws or divorced from reality. the three examples posed by the dissent are no exception. the dissent does not explain how the large sums it postulates can be legally rerouted to a particular candidate, why most state committees would participate in a plan to redirect their donations to a candidate in another state, or how a donor or group of donors can avoid regulations prohibiting contributions to a committee ""with the knowledge that a substantial portion"" of the contribution will support a candidate to whom the donor has already contributed, 11 cfr §110.1(h)(2).  the dissent argues that such knowledge may be difficult to prove, pointing to eight fec cases that did not proceed because of insufficient evidence of a donor's incriminating knowledge. see post, at 24-25. it might be that such guilty knowledge could not be shown because the donors were not guilty—a possibility that the dissent does not entertain. in any event, the donors described in those eight cases were typically alleged to have exceeded the base limits by $5,000 or less. the fec's failure to find the requisite knowledge in those cases hardly means that the agency will be equally powerless to prevent a scheme in which a donor routes millions of dollars in excess of the base limits to a particular candidate, as in the dissent's ""example two."" and if an fec official cannot establish knowledge of circumvention (or establish affiliation) when the same ten donors contribute $10,000 each to 200 newly created pacs, and each pac writes a $10,000 check to the same ten candidates—the dissent's ""example three""— then that official has not a heart but a head of stone. see post, at 19-20, 25.  the dissent concludes by citing three briefs for the proposition that, even with the aggregate limits in place, individuals ""have transferred large sums of money to specific candidates"" in excess of the base limits. post, at 26. but the cited sources do not provide any real-world examples of circumvention of the base limits along the lines of the various hypotheticals. the dearth of fec prosecutions, according to the dissent, proves only that people are getting away with it. and the violations that surely must be out there elude detection ""because in the real world, the methods of achieving circumvention are more subtle and more complex"" than the hypothetical examples. ibid. this sort of speculation, however, cannot justify the substantial intrusion on first amendment rights at issue in this case.  buckley upheld aggregate limits only on the ground that they prevented channeling money to candidates beyond the base limits. the absence of such a prospect today belies the government's asserted objective of preventing corruption or its appearance. the improbability of circumvention indicates that the aggregate limits instead further the impermissible objective of simply limiting the amount of money in political campaigns.  c  quite apart from the foregoing, the aggregate limits violate the first amendment because they are not ""closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms."" buckley, 424 u. s., at 25. in the first amendment context, fit matters. even when the court is not applying strict scrutiny, we still require ""a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is `in proportion to the interest served,' . . . that employs not necessarily the least restrictive means but . . . a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective."" board of trustees of state univ. of n. y. v. fox, 492 u. s. 469, 480 (1989) (quoting in re r. m. j., 455 u. s. 191, 203 (1982)). here, because the statute is poorly tailored to the government's interest in preventing circumvention of the base limits, it impermissibly restricts participation in the political process.  1  the government argues that the aggregate limits are justified because they prevent an individual from giving to too many initial recipients who might subsequently recontribute a donation. after all, only recontributed funds can conceivably give rise to circumvention of the base limits. yet all indications are that many types of recipients have scant interest in regifting donations they receive.  some figures might be useful to put the risk of circumvention in perspective. we recognize that no data can be marshaled to capture perfectly the counterfactual world in which aggregate limits do not exist. but, as we have noted elsewhere, we can nonetheless ask ""whether experience under the present law confirms a serious threat of abuse."" federal election comm'n v. colorado republican federal campaign comm., 533 u. s. 431, 457 (2001). it does not. experience suggests that the vast majority of contributions made in excess of the aggregate limits are likely to be retained and spent by their recipients rather than rerouted to candidates.  in the 2012 election cycle, federal candidates, political parties, and pacs spent a total of $7 billion, according to the fec. in particular, each national political party's spending ran in the hundreds of millions of dollars. the national republican senatorial committee (nrsc), national republican congressional committee (nrcc), democratic senatorial campaign committee (dscc), and democratic congressional campaign committee (dccc), however, spent less than $1 million each on direct candidate contributions and less than $10 million each on coordinated expenditures. brief for nrsc et al. as amici curiae 23, 25 (nrsc brief). including both coordinated expenditures and direct candidate contributions, the nrsc and dscc spent just 7% of their total funds on contributions to candidates and the nrcc and dccc spent just 3%.  likewise, as explained previously, state parties rarely contribute to candidates in other states. in the 2012 election cycle, the republican and democratic state party committees in all 50 states (and the district of columbia) contributed a paltry $17,750 to house and senate candidates in other states. the state party committees spent over half a billion dollars over the same time period, of which the $17,750 in contributions to other states' candidates constituted just 0.003%.  as with national and state party committees, candidates contribute only a small fraction of their campaign funds to other candidates. authorized candidate committees may support other candidates up to a $2,000 base limit. 2 u. s. c. §432(e)(3)(b). in the 2012 election, house candidates spent a total of $1.1 billion. candidate-to-candidate contributions among house candidates totaled $3.65 million, making up just 0.3% of candidates' overall spending. nrsc brief 29. the most that any one individual candidate received from all other candidates was around $100,000. brief for appellee 39. the fact is that candidates who receive campaign contributions spend most of the money on themselves, rather than passing along donations to other candidates. in this arena at least, charity begins at home.   based on what we can discern from experience, the indiscriminate ban on all contributions above the aggregate limits is disproportionate to the government's interest in preventing circumvention. the government has not given us any reason to believe that parties or candidates would dramatically shift their priorities if the aggregate limits were lifted. absent such a showing, we cannot conclude that the sweeping aggregate limits are appropriately tailored to guard against any contributions that might implicate the government's anticircumvention interest.  a final point: it is worth keeping in mind that the base limits themselves are a prophylactic measure. as we have explained, ""restrictions on direct contributions are preventative, because few if any contributions to candidates will involve quid pro quo arrangements."" citizens united, 558 u. s., at 357. the aggregate limits are then layered on top, ostensibly to prevent circumvention of the base limits. this ""prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis approach"" requires that we be particularly diligent in scrutinizing the law's fit. wisconsin right to life, 551 u. s., at 479 (opinion of roberts, c. j.); see mcconnell, 540 u. s., at 268-269 (opinion of thomas, j.).  2  importantly, there are multiple alternatives available to congress that would serve the government's anticircumvention interest, while avoiding ""unnecessary abridgment"" of first amendment rights. buckley, 424 u. s., at 25.  the most obvious might involve targeted restrictions on transfers among candidates and political committees. there are currently no such limits on transfers among party committees and from candidates to party committees. see 2 u. s. c. §441a(a)(4); 11 cfr §113.2(c). perhaps for that reason, a central concern of the district court, the government, multiple amici curiae, and the dissent has been the ability of party committees to transfer money freely. if congress agrees that this is problematic, it might tighten its permissive transfer rules. doing so would impose a lesser burden on first amendment rights, as compared to aggregate limits that flatly ban contributions beyond certain levels. and while the government has not conceded that transfer restrictions would be a perfect substitute for the aggregate limits, it has recognized that they would mitigate the risk of circumvention. see tr. of oral arg. 29.  one possible option for restricting transfers would be to require contributions above the current aggregate limits to be deposited into segregated, nontransferable accounts and spent only by their recipients. such a solution would address the same circumvention possibilities as the current aggregate limits, while not completely barring contributions beyond the aggregate levels. in addition (or as an alternative), if congress believes that circumvention is especially likely to occur through creation of a joint fundraising committee, it could require that funds received through those committees be spent by their recipients (or perhaps it could simply limit the size of joint fundraising committees). such alternatives to the aggregate limits properly refocus the inquiry on the delinquent actor: the recipient of a contribution within the base limits, who then routes the money in a manner that undermines those limits. see citizens united, supra, at 360-361; cf. bartnicki v. vopper, 532 u. s. 514, 529-530 (2001).  indeed, congress has adopted transfer restrictions, and the court has upheld them, in the context of state party spending. see 2 u. s. c. §441i(b). so-called ""levin funds"" are donations permissible under state law that may be spent on certain federal election activity—namely, voter registration and identification, get-out-the-vote efforts, or generic campaign activities. levin funds are raised directly by the state or local party committee that ultimately spends them. §441i(b)(2)(b)(iv). that means that other party committees may not transfer levin funds, solicit levin funds on behalf of the particular state or local committee, or engage in joint fundraising of levin funds. see mcconnell, 540 u. s., at 171-173. mcconnell upheld those transfer restrictions as ""justifiable anticircumvention measures,"" though it acknowledged that they posed some associational burdens. id., at 171. here, a narrow transfer restriction on contributions that could otherwise be recontributed in excess of the base limits could rely on a similar justification.  other alternatives might focus on earmarking. many of the scenarios that the government and the dissent hypothesize involve at least implicit agreements to circumvent the base limits—agreements that are already prohibited by the earmarking rules. see 11 cfr §110.6. the fec might strengthen those rules further by, for example, defining how many candidates a pac must support in order to ensure that ""a substantial portion"" of a donor's contribution is not rerouted to a certain candidate. §110.1(h)(2). congress might also consider a modified version of the aggregate limits, such as one that prohibits donors who have contributed the current maximum sums from further contributing to political committees that have indicated they will support candidates to whom the donor has already contributed. to be sure, the existing earmarking provision does not define ""the outer limit of acceptable tailoring."" colorado republican federal campaign comm., 533 u. s., at 462. but tighter rules could have a significant effect, especially when adopted in concert with other measures.  we do not mean to opine on the validity of any particular proposal. the point is that there are numerous alternative approaches available to congress to prevent circumvention of the base limits.  d  finally, disclosure of contributions minimizes the potential for abuse of the campaign finance system. disclosure requirements are in part ""justified based on a governmental interest in `provid  the electorate with information' about the sources of election-related spending."" citizens united, 558 u. s., at 367 (quoting buckley, supra, at 66). they may also ""deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity."" id., at 67. disclosure requirements burden speech, but—unlike the aggregate limits—they do not impose a ceiling on speech. citizens united, supra, at 366; but see mcconnell, supra, at 275-277 (opinion of thomas, j.). for that reason, disclosure often represents a less restrictive alternative to flat bans on certain types or quantities of speech. see, e.g., federal election comm'n v. massachusetts citizens for life, inc., 479 u. s. 238, 262 (1986).  with modern technology, disclosure now offers a particularly effective means of arming the voting public with information. in 1976, the court observed that congress could regard disclosure as ""only a partial measure."" buckley, 424 u. s., at 28. that perception was understandable in a world in which information about campaign contributions was filed at fec offices and was therefore virtually inaccessible to the average member of the public. see brief for cause of action institute as amicus curiae 15-16. today, given the internet, disclosure offers much more robust protections against corruption. see citizens united, supra, at 370-371. reports and databases are available on the fec's web site almost immediately after they are filed, supplemented by private entities such as open-secrets.org and followthemoney.org. because massive quantities of information can be accessed at the click of a mouse, disclosure is effective to a degree not possible at the time buckley, or even mcconnell, was decided.  the existing aggregate limits may in fact encourage the movement of money away from entities subject to disclosure. because individuals' direct contributions are limited, would-be donors may turn to other avenues for political speech. see citizens united, supra, at 364. individuals can, for example, contribute unlimited amounts to 501(c) organizations, which are not required to publicly disclose their donors. see 26 u. s. c. §6104(d)(3). such organizations spent some $300 million on independent expenditures in the 2012 election cycle.  v  at oral argument, the government shifted its focus from buckley's anticircumvention rationale to an argument that the aggregate limits deter corruption regardless of their ability to prevent circumvention of the base limits. see tr. of oral arg. 29-30, 50-52. the government argued that there is an opportunity for corruption whenever a large check is given to a legislator, even if the check consists of contributions within the base limits to be appropriately divided among numerous candidates and committees. the aggregate limits, the argument goes, ensure that the check amount does not become too large. that new rationale for the aggregate limits—embraced by the dissent, see post, at 15-17—does not wash. it dangerously broadens the circumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articulated in our prior cases, and targets as corruption the general, broad-based support of a political party.  in analyzing the base limits, buckley made clear that the risk of corruption arises when an individual makes large contributions to the candidate or officeholder himself. see 424 u. s., at 26-27. buckley's analysis of the aggregate limit under feca was similarly confined. the court noted that the aggregate limit guarded against an individual's funneling—through circumvention—""massive amounts of money to a particular candidate."" id., at 38 (emphasis added). we have reiterated that understanding several times. see, e.g., national conservative political action comm., 470 u. s., at 497 (quid pro quo corruption occurs when "" lected officials are influenced to act contrary to their obligations of office by the prospect of financial gain to themselves or infusions of money into their campaigns"" (emphasis added)); citizens against rent control/coalition for fair housing v. berkeley, 454 u. s. 290, 297 (1981) (buckley's holding that contribution limits are permissible ""relates to the perception of undue influence of large contributors to a candidate""); mcconnell, 540 u. s., at 296 (opinion of kennedy, j.) (quid pro quo corruption in buckley involved ""contributions that flowed to a particular candidate's benefit"" (emphasis added)).  of course a candidate would be pleased with a donor who contributed not only to the candidate himself, but also to other candidates from the same party, to party committees, and to pacs supporting the party. but there is a clear, administrable line between money beyond the base limits funneled in an identifiable way to a candidate—for which the candidate feels obligated—and money within the base limits given widely to a candidate's party—for which the candidate, like all other members of the party, feels grateful.  when donors furnish widely distributed support within all applicable base limits, all members of the party or supporters of the cause may benefit, and the leaders of the party or cause may feel particular gratitude. that gratitude stems from the basic nature of the party system, in which party members join together to further common political beliefs, and citizens can choose to support a party because they share some, most, or all of those beliefs. see tashjian v. republican party of conn., 479 u. s. 208, 214-216 (1986). to recast such shared interest, standing alone, as an opportunity for quid pro quo corruption would dramatically expand government regulation of the political process. cf. california democratic party v. jones, 530 u. s. 567, 572-573 (2000) (recognizing the government's ""role to play in structuring and monitoring the election process,"" but rejecting ""the proposition that party affairs are public affairs, free of first amendment protections"").  the government suggests that it is the solicitation of large contributions that poses the danger of corruption, see tr. of oral arg. 29-30, 38-39, 50-51; see also post, at 15-16, 20, but the aggregate limits are not limited to any direct solicitation by an officeholder or candidate. cf. mcconnell, supra, at 298-299, 308 (opinion of kennedy, j.) (rejecting a ban on ""soft money"" contributions to national parties, but approving a ban on the solicitation of such contributions as ""a direct and necessary regulation of federal candidates' and officeholders' receipt of quids""). we have no occasion to consider a law that would specifically ban candidates from soliciting donations—within the base limits—that would go to many other candidates, and would add up to a large sum. for our purposes here, it is enough that the aggregate limits at issue are not directed specifically to candidate behavior.  * * *  for the past 40 years, our campaign finance jurisprudence has focused on the need to preserve authority for the government to combat corruption, without at the same time compromising the political responsiveness at the heart of the democratic process, or allowing the government to favor some participants in that process over others. as edmund burke explained in his famous speech to the electors of bristol, a representative owes constituents the exercise of his ""mature judgment,"" but judgment informed by ""the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents."" the speeches of the right hon. edmund burke 129-130 (j. burke ed. 1867). constituents have the right to support candidates who share their views and concerns. representatives are not to follow constituent orders, but can be expected to be cognizant of and responsive to those concerns. such responsiveness is key to the very concept of self-governance through elected officials.  the government has a strong interest, no less critical to our democratic system, in combatting corruption and its appearance. we have, however, held that this interest must be limited to a specific kind of corruption—quid pro quo corruption—in order to ensure that the government's efforts do not have the effect of restricting the first amendment right of citizens to choose who shall govern them. for the reasons set forth, we conclude that the aggregate limits on contributions do not further the only governmental interest this court accepted as legitimate in buckley. they instead intrude without justification on a citizen's ability to exercise ""the most fundamental first amendment activities."" buckley, 424 u. s., at 14.  the judgment of the district court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.  it is so ordered.  justice thomas, concurring in the judgment.  i adhere to the view that this court's decision in buckley v. valeo, 424 u. s. 1 (1976) (per curiam), denigrates core first amendment speech and should be overruled. see randall v. sorrell, 548 u. s. 230, 265-267 (2006) (thomas, j., concurring in judgment); federal election comm'n v. beaumont, 539 u. s. 146, 164-165 (2003) (thomas, j., dissenting); federal election comm'n v. colorado republican federal campaign comm., 533 u. s. 431, 465-466 (2001) (colorado ii) (thomas, j., dissenting); nixon v. shrink missouri government pac, 528 u. s. 377, 412-420 (2000) (thomas, j., dissenting); colorado republican federal campaign comm. v. federal election comm'n, 518 u. s. 604, 635-640 (1996) (colorado i) (thomas, j., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part).  political speech is ""`the primary object of first amendment protection'"" and ""the lifeblood of a self-governing people."" colorado ii, supra, at 465-466 (thomas, j., dissenting). contributions to political campaigns, no less than direct expenditures, ""generate essential political speech"" by fostering discussion of public issues and candidate qualifications. shrink missouri, supra, at 412 (thomas, j., dissenting); see also id., at 410-411. buckley itself recognized that both contribution and expenditure limits ""operate in an area of the most fundamental first amendment activities"" and ""implicate fundamental first amendment interests."" 424 u. s., at 14, 23. but instead of treating political giving and political spending alike, buckley distinguished the two, embracing a bifurcated standard of review under which contribution limits receive less rigorous scrutiny. id., at 25.  as i have explained before, "" he analytic foundation of buckley . . . was tenuous from the very beginning and has only continued to erode in the intervening years."" shrink missouri, supra, at 412 (thomas, j., dissenting). to justify a lesser standard of review for contribution limits, buckley relied on the premise that contributions are different in kind from direct expenditures. none of the court's bases for that premise withstands careful review. the linchpin of the court's analysis was its assertion that "" hile contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present views to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor."" 424 u. s., at 21. but that ""`speech by proxy'"" rationale quickly breaks down, given that "" ven in the case of a direct expenditure, there is usually some go-between that facilitates the dissemination of the spender's message—for instance, an advertising agency or a television station."" colorado i, supra, at 638-639 (opinion of thomas, j.). moreover, we have since rejected the ""`proxy speech'"" approach as affording insufficient first amendment protection to ""the voices of those of modest means as opposed to those sufficiently wealthy to be able to buy expensive media ads with their own resources."" federal election comm'n v. national conservative political action comm., 470 u. s. 480, 495 (1985); see shrink missouri, supra, at 413-414 (thomas, j., dissenting).  the remaining justifications buckley provided are also flawed. for example, buckley claimed that contribution limits entail only a ""marginal"" speech restriction because ""  contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support."" 424 u. s., at 20, 21. but this court has never required a speaker to explain the reasons for his position in order to obtain full first amendment protection. instead, we have consistently held that speech is protected even ""when the underlying basis for a position is not given."" shrink missouri, supra, at 415, n. 3 (thomas, j., dissenting); see, e.g., city of ladue v. gilleo, 512 u. s. 43, 46 (1994) (sign reading ""for peace in the gulf""); texas v. johnson, 491 u. s. 397, 415-416 (1989) (flag burning); tinker v. des moines independent community school dist., 393 u. s. 503, 510-511 (1969) (black armband signifying opposition to vietnam war); see also colorado i, supra, at 640 (opinion of thomas, j.) (""even a pure message of support, unadorned with reasons, is valuable to the democratic process"")  equally unpersuasive is buckley's suggestion that contribution limits warrant less stringent review because "" he quantity of communication by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of his contribution,"" and "" t most, the size of the contribution provides a very rough index of the intensity of the contributor's support for the candidate."" 424 u. s., at 21. contributions do increase the quantity of communication by ""amplifying the voice of the candidate"" and ""help  to ensure the dissemination of the messages that the contributor wishes to convey."" shrink missouri, supra, at 415 (thomas, j., dissenting). they also serve as a quantifiable metric of the intensity of a particular contributor's support, as demonstrated by the frequent practice of giving different amounts to different candidates. buckley simply failed to recognize that ""we have accorded full first amendment protection to expressions of intensity."" id., at 415, n. 3; see also cohen v. california, 403 u. s. 15, 25-26 (1971) (protecting the use of an obscenity for emphasis).  although today's decision represents a faithful application of our precedents, the plurality's discussion of buckley omits any reference to these discarded rationales. instead, the plurality alludes only to buckley's last remaining reason for devaluing political contributions relative to expenditures. see ante, at 8 (quoting buckley, 424 u. s., at 21). the relevant sentence from buckley reads as follows:  ""a limitation on the amount of money a person may give to a candidate or campaign organization thus involves little direct restraint on his political communication, for it permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor's freedom to discuss candidates and issues."" ibid. that proposition, read in full, cannot be squared with a key premise of today's decision.  among the government's justifications for the aggregate limits set forth in the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 (bcra) is that ""an individual can engage in the `symbolic act of contributing' to as many entities as he wishes."" brief for appellee 20. that is, the government contends that aggregate limits are constitutional as long as an individual can still contribute some token amount (a dime, for example) to each of his preferred candidates. the plurality, quite correctly, rejects that argument, noting that "" t is no answer to say that the individual can simply contribute less money to more people."" ante, at 16. that is so because "" o require one person to contribute at lower levels than others because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to impose a special burden on broader participation in the democratic process."" ibid.  what the plurality does not recognize is that the same logic also defeats the reasoning from buckley on which the plurality purports to rely. under the plurality's analysis, limiting the amount of money a person may give to a candidate does impose a direct restraint on his political communication; if it did not, the aggregate limits at issue here would not create ""a special burden on broader participation in the democratic process."" ibid. i am wholly in agreement with the plurality's conclusion on this point: "" he government may not penalize an individual for `robustly exercis ' his first amendment rights."" ibid. (quoting davis v. federal election comm'n, 554 u. s. 724, 739 (2008)). i regret only that the plurality does not acknowledge that today's decision, although purporting not to overrule buckley, continues to chip away at its footings.  in sum, what remains of buckley is a rule without a rationale. contributions and expenditures are simply ""two sides of the same first amendment coin,"" and our efforts to distinguish the two have produced mere ""word games"" rather than any cognizable principle of constitutional law. buckley, supra, at 241, 244 (burger, c. j., concurring in part and dissenting in part). for that reason, i would overrule buckley and subject the aggregate limits in bcra to strict scrutiny, which they would surely fail. see colorado i, 518 u. s., at 640-641 (opinion of thomas, j.) (""i am convinced that under traditional strict scrutiny, broad prophylactic caps on both spending and giving in the political process . . . are unconstitutional"").  this case represents yet another missed opportunity to right the course of our campaign finance jurisprudence by restoring a standard that is faithful to the first amendment. until we undertake that reexamination, we remain in a ""halfway house"" of our own design. shrink missouri, 528 u. s., at 410 (kennedy, j., dissenting). for these reasons, i concur only in the judgment.  justice breyer, with whom justice ginsburg, justice sotomayor, and justice kagan join, dissenting.  nearly 40 years ago in buckley v. valeo, 424 u. s. 1 (1976) (per curiam), this court considered the constitutionality of laws that imposed limits upon the overall amount a single person can contribute to all federal candidates, political parties, and committees taken together. the court held that those limits did not violate the constitution. id., at 38; accord, mcconnell v. federal election comm'n, 540 u. s. 93, 138, n. 40, 152-153, n. 48 (2003) (citing with approval buckley's aggregate limits holding).  the buckley court focused upon the same problem that concerns the court today, and it wrote:  ""the overall $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candidates and committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of financial support. but this quite modest restraint upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate, or huge contributions to the candidate's political party. the limited, additional restriction on associational freedom imposed by the overall ceiling is thus no more than a corollary of the basic individual contribution limitation that we have found to be constitutionally valid."" 424 u. s., at 38. today a majority of the court overrules this holding. it is wrong to do so. its conclusion rests upon its own, not a record-based, view of the facts. its legal analysis is faulty: it misconstrues the nature of the competing constitutional interests at stake. it understates the importance of protecting the political integrity of our governmental institutions. it creates a loophole that will allow a single individual to contribute millions of dollars to a political party or to a candidate's campaign. taken together with citizens united v. federal election comm'n, 558 u. s. 310 (2010), today's decision eviscerates our nation's campaign finance laws, leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were intended to resolve.  i  the plurality concludes that the aggregate contribution limits ""`unnecessar  abridg '"" first amendment rights. ante, at 8, 30 (quoting buckley, supra, at 25). it notes that some individuals will wish to ""spen  `substantial amounts of money in order to communicate   political ideas through sophisticated' means."" ante, at 14-15 (quoting federal election comm'n v. national conservative political action comm., 470 u. s. 480, 493 (1985) (ncpac)). aggregate contribution ceilings limit an individual's ability to engage in such ""broader participation in the democratic process,"" while insufficiently advancing any legitimate governmental objective. ante, at 16, 21-29. hence, the plurality finds, they violate the constitution.  the plurality's conclusion rests upon three separate but related claims. each is fatally flawed. first, the plurality says that given the base limits on contributions to candidates and political committees, aggregate limits do not further any independent governmental objective worthy of protection. and that is because, given the base limits, "" pending large sums of money in connection with elections"" does not ""give rise to . . . corruption."" ante, at 19. in making this argument, the plurality relies heavily upon a narrow definition of ""corruption"" that excludes efforts to obtain ""`influence over or access to' elected officials or political parties."" ibid. (quoting citizens united, supra, at 359); accord, ante, at 18-20, 22-29.  second, the plurality assesses the instrumental objective of the aggregate limits, namely, safeguarding the base limits. it finds that they ""do not serve that function in any meaningful way."" ante, at 22. that is because, even without the aggregate limits, the possibilities for circumventing the base limits are ""implausible"" and ""divorced from reality."" ante, at 23, 24, 28.  third, the plurality says the aggregate limits are not a ""`reasonable'"" policy tool. rather, they are ""poorly tailored to the government's interest in preventing circumvention of the base limits."" ante, at 30 (quoting board of trustees of state univ. of n. y. v. fox, 492 u. s. 469, 480 (1989)). the plurality imagines several alternative regulations that it says might just as effectively thwart circumvention. accordingly, it finds, the aggregate caps are out of ""`proportion to the   interest served.'"" ante, at 30 (quoting fox, supra, at 480).  ii  the plurality's first claim—that large aggregate contributions do not ""give rise"" to ""corruption""—is plausible only because the plurality defines ""corruption"" too narrowly. the plurality describes the constitutionally permissible objective of campaign finance regulation as follows: ""congress may target only a specific type of corruption—`quid pro quo' corruption."" ante, at 19. it then defines quid pro quo corruption to mean no more than ""a direct exchange of an official act for money""—an act akin to bribery. ante, at 2-3. it adds specifically that corruption does not include efforts to ""garner `influence over or access to' elected officials or political parties."" ante, at 19 (quoting citizens united, supra, at 359). moreover, the government's efforts to prevent the ""appearance of corruption"" are ""equally confined to the appearance of quid pro quo corruption,"" as narrowly defined. ante, at 19. in the plurality's view, a federal statute could not prevent an individual from writing a million dollar check to a political party (by donating to its various committees), because the rationale for any limit would ""dangerously broade  the circumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articulated in our prior cases."" ante, at 37.  this critically important definition of ""corruption"" is inconsistent with the court's prior case law (with the possible exception of citizens united, as i will explain below). it is virtually impossible to reconcile with this court's decision in mcconnell, upholding the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 (bcra). and it misunderstands the constitutional importance of the interests at stake. in fact, constitutional interests—indeed, first amendment interests—lie on both sides of the legal equation.  a  in reality, as the history of campaign finance reform shows and as our earlier cases on the subject have recognized, the anticorruption interest that drives congress to regulate campaign contributions is a far broader, more important interest than the plurality acknowledges. it is an interest in maintaining the integrity of our public governmental institutions. and it is an interest rooted in the constitution and in the first amendment itself.  consider at least one reason why the first amendment protects political speech. speech does not exist in a vacuum. rather, political communication seeks to secure government action. a politically oriented ""marketplace of ideas"" seeks to form a public opinion that can and will influence elected representatives.  this is not a new idea. eighty-seven years ago, justice brandeis wrote that the first amendment's protection of speech was ""essential to effective democracy."" whitney v. california, 274 u. s. 357, 377 (1927) (concurring opinion). chief justice hughes reiterated the same idea shortly thereafter: ""a fundamental principle of our constitutional system"" is the ""maintenance of the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people."" stromberg v. california, 283 u. s. 359, 369 (1931) (emphasis added). in citizens united, the court stated that "" peech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people."" 558 u. s., at 339 (emphasis added).  the framers had good reason to emphasize this same connection between political speech and governmental action. an influential 18th-century continental philosopher had argued that in a representative democracy, the people lose control of their representatives between elections, during which interim periods they were ""in chains."" j. rousseau, an inquiry into the nature of the social contract 265-266 (transl. 1791).  the framers responded to this criticism both by requiring frequent elections to federal office, and by enacting a first amendment that would facilitate a ""chain of communication between the people, and those, to whom they have committed the exercise of the powers of government."" j. wilson, commentaries on the constitution of the united states of america 30-31 (1792). this ""chain"" would establish the necessary ""communion of interests and sympathy of sentiments"" between the people and their representatives, so that public opinion could be channeled into effective governmental action. the federalist no. 57, p. 386 (j. cooke ed. 1961) (j. madison); accord, t. benton, 1 abridgement of the debates of congress, from 1789 to 1856, p. 141 (1857) (explaining that the first amendment will strengthen american democracy by giving ""`the people'"" a right to ""`publicly address their representatives,'"" ""`privately advise them,'"" or ""`declare their sentiments by petition to the whole body'"" (quoting james madison)). accordingly, the first amendment advances not only the individual's right to engage in political speech, but also the public's interest in preserving a democratic order in which collective speech matters.  what has this to do with corruption? it has everything to do with corruption. corruption breaks the constitutionally necessary ""chain of communication"" between the people and their representatives. it derails the essential speech-to-government-action tie. where enough money calls the tune, the general public will not be heard. insofar as corruption cuts the link between political thought and political action, a free marketplace of political ideas loses its point. that is one reason why the court has stressed the constitutional importance of congress' concern that a few large donations not drown out the voices of the many. see, e.g., buckley, 424 u. s., at 26-27.  that is also why the court has used the phrase ""subversion of the political process"" to describe circumstances in which "" lected officials are influenced to act contrary to their obligations of office by the prospect of financial gain to themselves or infusions of money into their campaigns."" ncpac, 470 u. s., at 497. see also federal election comm'n v. national right to work comm., 459 u. s. 197, 208 (1982) (the government's interests in preventing corruption ""directly implicate the integrity of our electoral process"" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). see generally r. post, citizens divided: campaign finance reform and the constitution 7-16, 80-94 (forthcoming 2014) (arguing that the efficacy of american democracy depends on ""electoral integrity"" and the responsiveness of public officials to public opinion).  the ""appearance of corruption"" can make matters worse. it can lead the public to believe that its efforts to communicate with its representatives or to help sway public opinion have little purpose. and a cynical public can lose interest in political participation altogether. see nixon v. shrink missouri government pac, 528 u. s. 377, 390 (2000) ("" he cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance""). democracy, the court has often said, cannot work unless ""the people have faith in those who govern."" united states v. mississippi valley generating co., 364 u. s. 520, 562 (1961).  the upshot is that the interests the court has long described as preventing ""corruption"" or the ""appearance of corruption"" are more than ordinary factors to be weighed against the constitutional right to political speech. rather, they are interests rooted in the first amendment itself. they are rooted in the constitutional effort to create a democracy responsive to the people—a government where laws reflect the very thoughts, views, ideas, and sentiments, the expression of which the first amendment protects. given that end, we can and should understand campaign finance laws as resting upon a broader and more significant constitutional rationale than the plurality's limited definition of ""corruption"" suggests. we should see these laws as seeking in significant part to strengthen, rather than weaken, the first amendment. to say this is not to deny the potential for conflict between (1) the need to permit contributions that pay for the diffusion of ideas, and (2) the need to limit payments in order to help maintain the integrity of the electoral process. but that conflict takes place within, not outside, the first amendment's boundaries.  b  since the kinds of corruption that can destroy the link between public opinion and governmental action extend well beyond those the plurality describes, the plurality's notion of corruption is flatly inconsistent with the basic constitutional rationale i have just described. thus, it should surprise no one that this court's case law (citizens united excepted) insists upon a considerably broader definition.  in buckley, for instance, the court said explicitly that aggregate limits were constitutional because they helped ""prevent evasion . . .   huge contributions to the candidate's political party,"" 424 u. s., at 26 (the contrary to what the plurality today seems to believe, see ante, at 36-39). moreover, buckley upheld the base limits in significant part because they helped thwart ""the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions."" 424 u. s., at 27 (emphasis added). and it said that congress could reasonably conclude that criminal laws forbidding ""the giving and taking of bribes"" did not adequately ""deal with the reality or appearance of corruption."" id., at 28. bribery laws, the court recognized, address ""only the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action."" ibid. the concern with corruption extends further.  other cases put the matter yet more strongly. in beaumont, for example, the court found constitutional a ban on direct contributions by corporations because of the need to prevent corruption, properly ""understood not only as quid pro quo agreements, but also as undue influence on an officeholder's judgment."" federal election comm'n v. beaumont, 539 u. s. 146, 155-156 (2003). in federal election comm'n v. colorado republican federal campaign comm., 533 u. s. 431, 441, 457-460 (2001) (colorado ii), the court upheld limits imposed upon coordinated expenditures among parties and candidates because it found they thwarted corruption and its appearance, again understood as including ""undue influence"" by wealthy donors. in shrink missouri, the court upheld limitations imposed by the missouri legislature upon contributions to state political candidates, not only because of the need to prevent bribery, but also because of ""the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors."" 528 u. s., at 389.  c  most important, in mcconnell, this court considered the constitutionality of the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002, an act that set new limits on ""soft money"" contributions to political parties. ""soft money"" referred to funds that, prior to bcra, were freely donated to parties for activities other than directly helping elect a federal candidate—activities such as voter registration, ""get out the vote"" drives, and advertising that did not expressly advocate a federal candidate's election or defeat. 540 u. s., at 122-124. bcra imposed a new ban on soft money contributions to national party committees, and greatly curtailed them in respect to state and local parties. id., at 133-134, 161-164.  the court in mcconnell upheld these new contribution restrictions under the first amendment for the very reason the plurality today discounts or ignores. namely, the court found they thwarted a significant risk of corruption—understood not as quid pro quo bribery, but as privileged access to and pernicious influence upon elected representatives.  in reaching its conclusion in mcconnell, the court relied upon a vast record compiled in the district court. that record consisted of over 100,000 pages of material and included testimony from more than 200 witnesses. see 251 f. supp. 2d 176, 209 (dc 2003) (per curiam). what it showed, in detail, was the web of relationships and understandings among parties, candidates, and large donors that underlies privileged access and influence. see mcconnell, 540 u. s., at 146-152, 154-157, 167-171, 182-184. the district judges in mcconnell made clear that the record did ""not contain any evidence of bribery or vote buying in exchange for donations of nonfederal money."" 251 f. supp. 2d, at 481 (opinion of kollar-kotelly, j.) (emphasis added). indeed, no one had identified a ""single discrete instance of quid pro quo corruption"" due to soft money. id., at 395 (opinion of henderson, j.). but what the record did demonstrate was that enormous soft money contributions, ranging between $1 million and $5 million among the largest donors, enabled wealthy contributors to gain disproportionate ""access to federal lawmakers"" and the ability to ""influenc  legislation."" id., at 481 (opinion of kollar-kotelly, j.). there was an indisputable link between generous political donations and opportunity after opportunity to make one's case directly to a member of congress.  testimony by elected officials supported this conclusion. see, e.g., ibid. (""`large donors of both hard and soft money receive special treatment'"" (sen. simpson)); id., at 482 (""`donations, including soft money donations to political parties, do affect how congress operates. it's only natural, and happens all too often, that a busy senator with 10 minutes to spare will spend those minutes returning the call of a large soft money donor'"" (sen. boren)); id., at 496 (""`at a minimum, large soft money donations purchase an opportunity for the donors to make their case to elected officials . . .'"" (sen. mccain)). furthermore, testimony from party operatives showed that national political parties had created ""major donor programs,"" through which they openly ""offer  greater access to federal office holders as the donations gr w larger."" id., at 502. i have placed in appendix a more examples of the kind of evidence that filled the district court record in mcconnell.  this court upheld bcra's limitations on soft money contributions by relying on just the kind of evidence i have described. we wrote:  ""the evidence in the record shows that candidates and donors alike have in fact exploited the soft-money loophole, the former to increase their prospects of election and the latter to create debt on the part of office-holders. . . . plaintiffs argue that without concrete evidence of an instance in which a federal officeholder has actually switched a vote   . . ., congress has not shown that there exists real or apparent corruption. . . .  laintiffs conceive of corruption too narrowly. our cases have firmly established that congress' legitimate interest extends beyond preventing simple cash-for-votes corruption to curbing `undue influence on an officeholder's judgment, and the appearance of such influence.'"" 540 u. s., at 146, 149-150 (quoting colorado ii, 533 u. s., at 441; emphasis added; paragraphs and paragraph breaks omitted). we specifically rejected efforts to define ""corruption"" in ways similar to those the plurality today accepts. we added:  ""just as troubling to a functioning democracy as classic quid pro quo corruption is the danger that officeholders will decide issues not on the merits or the desires of their constituencies, but according to the wishes of those who have made large financial contributions valued by the officeholder."" 540 u. s., at 153. insofar as today's decision sets forth a significantly narrower definition of ""corruption,"" and hence of the public's interest in political integrity, it is flatly inconsistent with mcconnell.  d  one case, however, contains language that offers the plurality support. that case is citizens united. there, as the plurality points out, ante, at 19, the court said that "" hen buckley identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited to quid pro quo corruption."" 558 u. s., at 359. further, the court said that quid pro quo corruption does not include ""influence over or access to elected officials,"" because ""`generic favoritism or influence theory . . . is at odds with standard first amendment analyses.'"" ibid. (quoting mcconnell, supra, at 296 (kennedy, j., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part)).  how should we treat these statements from citizens united now? they are not essential to the court's holding in the case—at least insofar as it can be read to require federal law to treat corporations and trade unions like individuals when they independently pay for, e.g., television advertising during the last 60 days of a federal election. citizens united, supra, at 365. taken literally, the statements cited simply refer to and characterize stillearlier court cases. they do not require the more absolute reading that the plurality here gives them.  more than that. read as the plurality reads them today, the statements from citizens united about the proper contours of the corruption rationale conflict not just with language in the mcconnell opinion, but with mcconnell's very holding. see supra, at 9-11. did the court in citizens united intend to overrule mcconnell? i doubt it, for if it did, the court or certainly the dissent would have said something about it. the total silence of all opinions in citizens united with respect to this matter argues strongly in favor of treating the language quoted above as dictum, as an overstatement, or as limited to the context in which it appears. citizens united itself contains language that supports the last mentioned reading, for it says that ""  did not extend this rationale   to independent expenditures, and the court does not do so here."" 558 u. s., at 357 (emphasis added). and it adds that, while "" he bcra record establishes that certain donations to political parties, called `soft money,' were made to gain access to elected officials,"" "" his case, however, is about independent expenditures, not soft money."" id., at 360-361 (emphasis added).  the plurality's use of citizens united's narrow definition of corruption here, however, is a different matter. that use does not come accompanied with a limiting context (independent expenditures by corporations and unions) or limiting language. it applies to the whole of campaign finance regulation. and, as i have pointed out, it is flatly inconsistent with the broader definition of corruption upon which mcconnell's holding depends.  so: does the court intend today to overrule mcconnell? or does it intend to leave mcconnell and bcra in place? the plurality says the latter. ante, at 20-21, n. 6 (""our holding about the constitutionality of the aggregate limits clearly does not overrule mcconnell's holding about `soft money'""). but how does the plurality explain its rejection of the broader definition of corruption, upon which mcconnell's holding depends? compare ante, at 18-21, with mcconnell, 540 u. s., at 146, 149-153.  iii  the plurality invalidates the aggregate contribution limits for a second reason. it believes they are no longer needed to prevent contributors from circumventing federal limits on direct contributions to individuals, political parties, and political action committees. ante, at 22-29. cf. buckley, 424 u. s., at 38 (aggregate limits ""prevent evasion"" of base contribution limits). other ""campaign finance laws,"" combined with ""experience"" and ""common sense,"" foreclose the various circumvention scenarios that the government hypothesizes. ante, at 28. accordingly, the plurality concludes, the aggregate limits provide no added benefit.  the plurality is wrong. here, as in buckley, in the absence of limits on aggregate political contributions, donors can and likely will find ways to channel millions of dollars to parties and to individual candidates, producing precisely the kind of ""corruption"" or ""appearance of corruption"" that previously led the court to hold aggregate limits constitutional. those opportunities for circumvention will also produce the type of corruption that concerns the plurality today. the methods for using today's opinion to evade the law's individual contribution limits are complex, but they are well known, or will become well known, to party fundraisers. i shall describe three.  a  example one: gifts for the benefit of the party. campaign finance law permits each individual to give $64,800 over two years to a national party committee. 2 u. s. c. §441a(a)(1)(b); 78 fed. reg. 8532 (2013). the two major political parties each have three national committees. ante, at 4, n. 1. federal law also entitles an individual to give $20,000 to a state party committee over two years. §441a(a)(1)(d). each major political party has 50 such committees. those individual limits mean that, in the absence of any aggregate limit, an individual could legally give to the republican party or to the democratic party about $1.2 million over two years. see appendix b, table 1, infra, at 39. to make it easier for contributors to give gifts of this size, each party could create a ""joint party committee,"" comprising all of its national and state party committees. the titular heads could be the speaker of the house of representatives and the minority leader of the house. a contributor could then write a single check to the joint party committee—and its staff would divide the funds so that each constituent unit receives no more than it could obtain from the contributor directly ($64,800 for a national committee over two years, $20,000 for a state committee over the same). before today's decision, the total size of rich donor's check to the joint party committee was capped at $74,600—the aggregate limit for donations to political parties over a 2-year election cycle. see §441a(a)(3)(b); 78 fed. reg. 8532. after today's decision, rich donor can write a single check to the joint party committee in an amount of about $1.2 million.  will political parties seek these large checks? why not? the recipient national and state committees can spend the money to buy generic party advertisements, say television commercials or bumper stickers saying ""support republicans,"" ""support democrats,"" or the like. they also can transfer the money to party committees in battleground states to increase the chances of winning hotly contested seats. see §441a(a)(4) (permitting national or state political committees to make unlimited ""transfers"" to other committees ""of the same political party"").  will party officials and candidates solicit these large contributions from wealthy donors? absolutely. such contributions will help increase the party's power, as well as the candidate's standing among his colleagues.  will elected officials be particularly grateful to the large donor, feeling obliged to provide him special access and influence, and perhaps even a quid pro quo legislative favor? that is what we have previously believed. see mcconnell, 540 u. s., at 182 (""large soft-money donations at a candidate's or officeholder's behest give rise to all of the same corruption concerns posed by contributions made directly to the candidate or officeholder""); id., at 308 (opinion of kennedy, j.) (""the making of a solicited gift is a quid both to the recipient of the money and to the one who solicits the payment""); colorado ii, 533 u. s., at 460, n. 23 (explaining how a candidate can ""become a player   beyond his own race"" by ""directing donations to the party and making sure that the party knows who raised the money,"" and that ""the donor's influence is multiplied"" in such instances). and, as the statements collected in appendix a, infra, make clear, we have believed this with good reason.  example two: donations to individual candidates (the $3.6 million check). the first example significantly understates the problem. that is because federal election law also allows a single contributor to give $5,200 to each party candidate over a 2-year election cycle (assuming the candidate is running in both a primary and a general election). §441a(a)(1)(a); 78 fed. reg. 8532. there are 435 party candidates for house seats and 33 party candidates for senate seats in any given election year. that makes an additional $2.4 million in allowable contributions. thus, without an aggregate limit, the law will permit a wealthy individual to write a check, over a 2-year election cycle, for $3.6 million—all to benefit his political party and its candidates. see appendix b, table 2(a), infra, at 39.  to make it easier for a wealthy donor to make a contribution of this size, the parties can simply enlarge the composition of the joint party committee described in example one, so that it now includes party candidates. and a party can proliferate such joint entities, perhaps calling the first the ""smith victory committee,"" the second the ""jones victory committee,"" and the like. see 11 cfr §102.17(c)(5) (2012). (i say ""perhaps"" because too transparent a name might call into play certain earmarking rules. but the federal election commission's (fec) database of joint fundraising committees in 2012 shows similarly named entities, e.g., ""landrieu wyden victory fund,"" etc.).  as i have just said, without any aggregate limit, the law will allow rich donor to write a single check to, say, the smith victory committee, for up to $3.6 million. this check represents ""the total amount that the contributor could contribute to all of the participants"" in the committee over a 2-year cycle. §102.17(c)(5). the committee would operate under an agreement that provides a ""formula for the allocation of fundraising proceeds"" among its constituent units. §102.17(c)(1). and that ""formula"" would divide the proceeds so that no committee or candidate receives more than it could have received from rich donor directly—$64,800, $20,000, or $5,200. see §102.17(c)(6).  so what is wrong with that? the check is considerably larger than example one's check. but is there anything else wrong? the answer is yes, absolutely. the law will also permit a party and its candidates to shift most of rich donor's contributions to a single candidate, say smith. here is how:  the law permits each candidate and each party committee in the smith victory committee to write candidate smith a check directly. for his primary and general elections combined, they can write checks of up to $4,000 (from each candidate's authorized campaign committee) and $10,000 (from each state and national committee). 2 u. s. c. §§432(e)(3)(b), 441a(a)(2)(a); 11 cfr §110.3(b). this yields a potential $1,872,000 (from candidates) plus $530,000 (from party committees). thus, the law permits the candidates and party entities to redirect $2.37 million of rich donor's $3.6 million check to candidate smith. it also permits state and national committees to contribute to smith's general election campaign through making coordinated expenditures—in amounts that range from $46,600 to $2.68 million for a general election (depending upon the size of smith's state and whether he is running for a house or senate seat). 78 fed. reg. 8530-8532. see appendix b, table 2(b), infra, at 40.  the upshot is that candidate smith can receive at least $2.37 million and possibly the full $3.6 million contributed by rich donor to the smith victory committee, even though the funds must first be divided up among the constituent units before they can be rerouted to smith. nothing requires the smith victory committee to explain in advance to rich donor all of the various transfers that will take place, and nothing prevents the entities in the committee from informing the donor and the receiving candidate after the fact what has transpired. accordingly, the money can be donated and rerouted to candidate smith without the donor having violated the base limits or any other fec regulation. and the evidence in the mcconnell record reprinted in appendix a, infra—with respect to soft money contributions—makes clear that candidate smith will almost certainly come to learn from whom he has received this money.  the parties can apply the same procedure to other large donations, channeling money from rich donor two to candidate jones. if 10 or 20 candidates face particularly tight races, party committees and party candidates may work together to channel rich donor one's multimillion dollar contribution to the most embattled candidate (e.g., candidate smith), rich donor two's multimillion dollar contribution to the second most embattled candidate (e.g., candidate jones), and so on down the line. if this does not count as evasion of the base limits, what does? present aggregate limits confine the size of any individual gift to $123,200. today's opinion creates a loophole measured in the millions.  example three: proliferating political action committees (pacs). campaign finance law prohibits an individual from contributing (1) more than $5,200 to any candidate in a federal election cycle, and (2) more than $5,000 to a pac in a calendar year. 2 u. s. c. §§441a(a)(1)(a), (c); 78 fed. reg. 8532. it also prohibits (3) any pac from contributing more than $10,000 to any candidate in an election cycle. §441(a)(2)(a). but the law does not prohibit an individual from contributing (within the current $123,200 biannual aggregate limit) $5,000 to each of an unlimited total number of pacs. and there, so to speak, lies the rub.  here is how, without any aggregate limits, a party will be able to channel $2 million from each of ten rich donors to each of ten embattled candidates. groups of party supporters—individuals, corporations, or trade unions— create 200 pacs. each pac claims it will use the funds it raises to support several candidates from the party, though it will favor those who are most endangered. (each pac qualifies for ""multicandidate"" status because it has received contributions from more than 50 persons and has made contributions to five federal candidates at some point previously. §441a(a)(4); 11 cfr §100.5(e)(3)). over a 2-year election cycle, rich donor one gives $10,000 to each pac ($5,000 per year)—yielding $2 million total. rich donor 2 does the same. so, too, do the other eight rich donors. this brings their total donations to $20 million, disbursed among the 200 pacs. each pac will have collected $100,000, and each can use its money to write ten checks of $10,000—to each of the ten most embattled candidates in the party (over two years). see appendix b, table 3, infra, at 41. every embattled candidate, receiving a $10,000 check from 200 pacs, will have collected $2 million.  the upshot is that ten rich donors will have contributed $2 million each, and ten embattled candidates will have collected $2 million each. in this example, unlike example two, the recipient candidates may not know which of the ten rich donors is personally responsible for the $2 million he or she receives. but the recipient candidate is highly likely to know who the ten rich donors are, and to feel appropriately grateful. moreover, the ability of a small group of donors to contribute this kind of money to threatened candidates is not insignificant. in the example above—with ten rich donors giving $2 million each, and ten embattled candidates receiving $2 million each—the contributions would have been enough to finance a considerable portion of, and perhaps all of, the candidates' races in the 2012 elections. see appendix c, table 1, infra, at 42 (showing that in 2012, the average winning house candidate spent $1.6 million and the average winning senate candidate spent $11.5 million).  b  the plurality believes that the three scenarios i have just depicted either pose no threat, or cannot or will not take place. it does not believe the scenario depicted in example one is any cause for concern, because it involves only ""general, broad-based support of a political party."" ante, at 37. not so. a candidate who solicits a multimillion dollar check for his party will be deeply grateful to the checkwriter, and surely could reward him with a quid pro quo favor. the plurality discounts the scenarios depicted in example two and example three because it finds such circumvention tactics ""illegal under current campaign finance laws,"" ""implausible,"" or ""divorced from reality."" ante, at 23, 24, 28. but they are not.  the plurality's view depends in large part upon its claim that since this court decided buckley in 1976, changes in either statutory law or in applicable regulations have come to make it difficult, if not impossible, for these circumvention scenarios to arise. hence, it concludes, there is no longer a need for aggregate contribution limits. see ante, at 11-13, 22-29. but a closer examination of the five legal changes to which the plurality points makes clear that those changes cannot effectively stop the abuses that i have depicted.  first, the plurality points out that in 1976 (a few months after this court decided buckley) congress ""added limits on contributions to political committees,"" i.e., to pacs. ante, at 11; accord, 90 stat. 487 (codified at 2 u. s. c. §441a(a)(1)(c)). but example three, the hererelevant example, takes account of those limits, namely, $5,000 to a pac in any given year. and it shows that the per-pac limit does not matter much when it comes to the potential for circumvention, as long as party supporters can create dozens or hundreds of pacs. federal law places no upper limit on the number of pacs supporting a party or a group of party candidates that can be established. and creating a pac is primarily a matter of paperwork, a knowledgeable staff person, and a little time.  second, the plurality points out that in 1976, congress ""also added an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees."" ante, at 12. the rule provides that ""all contributions made by political committees established or financed or maintained or controlled"" by the same corporation, labor organization, person, or group of persons, ""shall be considered to have been made by a single political committee."" §441a(a)(5). but different supporters can create different pacs. indeed, there were roughly 2,700 ""nonconnected"" pacs (i.e., pacs not connected to a specific corporation or labor union) operating during the 2012 elections. ante, at 24. in a future without aggregate contribution limits, far more nonconnected pacs will likely appear. the plurality also notes that the fec can examine certain ""`circumstantial factors,'"" such as ""`common or overlapping membership'"" or ""`similar patterns of contributions,'"" to determine whether a group of pacs are affiliated. ante, at 25 (quoting 11 cfr §100.5(g)(4)(ii)). but the ultimate question in the affiliation inquiry is whether ""one committee or organization   been established, financed, maintain or controlled by another committee or sponsoring organization."" ibid. just because a group of multicandidate pacs all support the same party and all decide to donate funds to a group of endangered candidates in that party does not mean they will qualify as ""affiliated"" under the relevant definition. this rule appears inadequate to stop the sort of circumvention depicted in example three.  third, the plurality says that a post-buckley regulation has strengthened the statute's earmarking provision. ante, at 12. namely, the plurality points to a rule promulgated by the fec in 1976, specifying that earmarking includes any ""designation `whether direct or indirect, express or implied, oral or written.'"" ibid. (quoting 11 cfr §110.6(b)); accord, 41 fed. reg. 35950 (1976). this means that if rich donor were to give $5,000 to a pac while ""designat "" (in any way) that the money go to candidate smith, those funds must count towards rich donor's total allowable contributions to smith—$5,200 per election cycle. but the virtually identical earmarking provision in effect when this court decided buckley would have required the same thing. that provision also counted, when applying the base contribution limits, ""all contributions made by a person, either directly or indirectly, on behalf of a particular candidate, including contributions which are in any way earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary or conduit to a candidate."" 88 stat. 1264; accord, 2 u. s. c. §441a(a)(8) (same). what is the difference?  fourth, the plurality points out that the fec's regulations ""specify that an individual who has contributed to a particular candidate committee may not also contribute to a single-candidate committee for that candidate."" ante, at 12-13 (citing 11 cfr §110.1(h)(1); emphasis added). the regulations, however, do not prevent a person who has contributed to a candidate from also contributing to multi-candidate committees that support the candidate. indeed, the rules specifically authorize such contributions. see §110.1(h) (""a person may contribute to a candidate . . . and also contribute to a political committee which has supported, or anticipates supporting, the same candidate in the same election,"" as long as the political committee is ""not the candidate's principal campaign committee"" or a ""single candidate committee"" (emphasis added)). example three illustrates the latter kind of contribution. and briefs before us make clear that the possibility for circumventing the base limits through making such contributions is a realistic, not an illusory, one. see brief for appellee 36 (demonstrating that many pacs today explain in their public materials just what fairly small group of candidates they intend to support); brief for americans for campaign reform as amicus curiae 14-15 (similar).  fifth, the plurality points to another fec regulation (also added in 1976), which says that ""an individual who has contributed to a candidate"" may not ""also contribute to a political committee that has supported or anticipates supporting the same candidate if the individual knows that `a substantial portion   will be contributed to, or expended on behalf of,' that candidate."" ante, at 13 (quoting 11 cfr §110.1(h)(2); brackets in original); accord, 41 fed. reg. 35948. this regulation is important, for in principle, the fec might use it to prevent the circumstances that examples two and three set forth from arising. and it is not surprising that the plurality relies upon the existence of this rule when it describes those circumstances as ""implausible,"" ""illegal,"" or ""divorced from reality."" ante, at 23, 24, 28.  in fact, however, this regulation is not the strong anti-circumvention weapon that the plurality imagines. despite the plurality's assurances, it does not ""disarm"" the possibilities for circumvention. ante, at 23. that is because the regulation requires a showing that donors have ""knowledge that a substantial portion"" of their contributions will be used by a pac to support a candidate to whom they have already contributed. §110.1(h)(2) (emphasis added). and ""knowledge"" is hard to prove.  i have found nine fec cases decided since the year 2000 that refer to this regulation. in all but one, the fec failed to find the requisite ""knowledge""—despite the presence of example two or example three circumstances. see factual and legal analysis, in re: transfund pac, matter under review (mur) 6221, p. 11 (fec, june 7, 2010) (although the donor ""might reasonably infer that some portion of his contribution"" to a candidate's leadership pac would be used to support the candidate, ""such an inference alone does not suggest that   had `actual knowledge'"" of such); factual and legal analysis, in re: john shadegg's friends, mur 5968, pp. 3, 6-7 (fec, nov. 10, 2008) ("" here is no basis on which to conclude that   knew that the funds they contributed to lead pac would be used to support the shadegg committee"" even though congressman shadegg solicited the donations and lead pac was congressman shadegg's leadership pac); factual and legal analysis, in re: walberg for congress, mur 5881, pp. 6, 9-11 (fec, aug. 15, 2007) (finding seven contributors, who gave to a candidate and to a pac that provided 86% of the candidate's financing, had not shown ""knowledge""); factual and legal analysis, in re: matt brown for senate, mur 5732, p. 11 (fec, apr. 4, 2007) (""though it may be reasonable to infer that the individual donors solicited by brown gave to the state parties under the assumption that some portion of their contribution might then be donated to the brown committee, such an inference alone is insufficient to find reason to believe 11 cfr §110.1(h) has been violated""); first general counsel's report, in re: liffrig for senate, mur 5678, pp. 8-9 (fec, nov. 27, 2006) (similar); first general counsel's report, in re: nesbitt, mur 5445, pp. 11-12 (fec, feb. 2, 2005) (similar); first general counsel's report, in re: keystone corp., mur 5019, pp. 23-29 (fec, feb. 5, 2001) (similar); general counsel's report #2, in re: boston capital corp., mur 4538, pp. 17-18 (fec, mar. 10, 2000) (recommending the fec take no action with respect to the §110.1(h) issue). given this record of fec (in)activity, my reaction to the plurality's reliance upon agency enforcement of this rule (as an adequate substitute for congress' aggregate limits) is like oscar wilde's after reading dickens' account of the death of little nell: ""one must have a heart of stone,"" said wilde, ""to read   without laughing."" oxford dictionary of humorous quotations 86 (n. sherrin 2d ed. 2001).  i have found one contrary example—the single example to which the plurality refers. ante, at 25 (citing conciliation agreement, in re riley, murs 4568, 4633, 4634, 4736 (fec, dec. 19, 2001)). in that case, the fec found probable cause to believe that three individual contributors to several pacs had the requisite ""knowledge"" that the pacs would use a ""substantial portion"" of their contributions to support a candidate to whom they had already contributed— sam brownback, a candidate for the senate (for two of the contributors), and robert riley, a candidate for the house (for the third). the individuals had made donations to several pacs operating as a network, under the direction of a single political consulting firm. the two contributors to sam brownback were his parents-in-law, and the fec believed they might be using the pac network to channel extra support to him. the contributor to robert riley was his son, and the fec believed he might be doing the same. the facts in this case are unusual, for individual contributors are not typically relatives of the candidates they are seeking to support, and ordinary pacs do not tend to work in coordination under the direction of a consulting firm. in any event, this single swallow cannot make the plurality's summer.  thus, it is not surprising that throughout the many years this fec regulation has been in effect, political parties and candidates have established ever more joint fundraising committees (numbering over 500 in the last federal elections); candidates have established ever more ""leadership pacs"" (numbering over 450 in the last elections); and party supporters have established ever more multicandidate pacs (numbering over 3,000 in the last elections). see appendix c, tables 2-3, infra, at 42-43; fec, 2014 committee summary (reporting the number of ""qualified"" (or multicandidate) pacs in 2012), online at http://www.fec.gov/data/committeesummary.do (all internet materials as visited mar. 28, 2014, and available in clerk of court's case file).  using these entities, candidates, parties, and party supporters can transfer and, we are told, have transferred large sums of money to specific candidates, thereby avoiding the base contribution limits in ways that examples two and three help demonstrate. see brief for appellee 38-39, 53-54; brief for campaign legal center, et al. as amici curiae 12-15; brief of democratic members of the united states house of representatives as amici curiae 28-29. they have done so without drawing fec prosecution—at least not according to my (and apparently the plurality's) search of publicly available records. that is likely because in the real world, the methods of achieving circumvention are more subtle and more complex than our stylized examples two and three depict. and persons have used these entities to channel money to candidates without any individual breaching the current aggregate $123,200 limit. the plurality now removes that limit, thereby permitting wealthy donors to make aggregate contributions not of $123,200, but of several millions of dollars. if the fec regulation has failed to plug a small hole, how can it possibly plug a large one?  iv  the plurality concludes that even if circumvention were a threat, the aggregate limits are ""poorly tailored"" to address it. ante, at 30. the first amendment requires ""`a fit that is . . . reasonable,'"" and there is no such ""fit"" here because there are several alternative ways congress could prevent evasion of the base limits. ibid. (quoting fox, 492 u. s., at 480). for instance, the plurality posits, congress (or the fec) could ""tighten . . . transfer rules""; it could require ""contributions above the current aggregate limits to be deposited into segregated, nontransferable accounts and spent only by their recipients""; it could define ""how many candidates a pac must support in order to ensure that `a substantial portion' of a donor's contribution is not rerouted to a certain candidate""; or it could prohibit ""donors who have contributed the current maximum sums from further contributing to political committees that have indicated they will support candidates to whom the donor has already contributed."" ante, at 33-35 (quoting 11 cfr §110.1(h)(2)).  the plurality, however, does not show, or try to show, that these hypothetical alternatives could effectively replace aggregate contribution limits. indeed, it does not even ""opine on the validity of any particular proposal,"" ante, at 35—presumably because these proposals themselves could be subject to constitutional challenges. for the most part, the alternatives the plurality mentions were similarly available at the time of buckley. their hypothetical presence did not prevent the court from upholding aggregate limits in 1976. how can their continued hypothetical presence lead the plurality now to conclude that aggregate limits are ""poorly tailored?"" see ante, at 30. how can their continued hypothetical presence lead the court to overrule buckley now?  in sum, the explanation of why aggregate limits are needed is complicated, as is the explanation of why other methods will not work. but the conclusion is simple: there is no ""substantial mismatch"" between congress' legitimate objective and the ""means selected to achieve it."" ante, at 10. the court, as in buckley, should hold that aggregate contribution limits are constitutional.  v  the district court in this case, holding that buckley foreclosed mccutcheon's constitutional challenge to the aggregate limits, granted the government's motion to dismiss the complaint prior to a full evidentiary hearing. see 893 f. supp. 2d 133, 140-141 (dc 2012). if the plurality now believes the district court was wrong, then why does it not return the case for the further evidentiary development which has not yet taken place?  in the past, when evaluating the constitutionality of campaign finance restrictions, we have typically relied upon an evidentiary record amassed below to determine whether the law served a compelling governmental objective. and, typically, that record contained testimony from members of congress (or state legislators) explaining why congress (or the legislature) acted as it did. see, e.g., mcconnell, 540 u. s., at 147-154 (upholding federal restrictions on soft money by drawing on an extensive district court record that contained declarations from current and former members of congress); colorado ii, 533 u. s., at 457-465 (upholding federal limits on coordinated expenditures between parties and candidates on the basis of a summary judgment record that contained declarations from party operatives, fundraisers, and members of congress); shrink missouri, 528 u. s., at 393 (upholding missouri's contribution limits on the basis of the lower court record, which contained similar declarations). if we are to overturn an act of congress here, we should do so on the basis of a similar record.  for one thing, an evidentiary record can help us determine whether or the extent to which we should defer to congress' own judgments, particularly those reflecting a balance of the countervailing first amendment interests i have described. determining whether anticorruption objectives justify a particular set of contribution limits requires answering empirically based questions, and applying significant discretion and judgment. to what extent will unrestricted giving lead to corruption or its appearance? what forms will any such corruption take? to what extent will a lack of regulation undermine public confidence in the democratic system? to what extent can regulation restore it?  these kinds of questions, while not easily answered, are questions that congress is far better suited to resolve than are judges. thus, while court review of contribution limits has been and should be ""rigorous,"" buckley, 424 u. s., at 29, we have also recognized that ""deference to legislative choice is warranted."" beaumont, 539 u. s., at 155. and that deference has taken account of facts and circumstances set forth in an evidentiary record.  for another thing, a comparison of the plurality's opinion with this dissent reveals important differences of opinion on fact-related matters. we disagree, for example, on the possibilities for circumvention of the base limits in the absence of aggregate limits. we disagree about how effectively the plurality's ""alternatives"" could prevent evasion. an evidentiary proceeding would permit the parties to explore these matters, and it would permit the courts to reach a more accurate judgment. the plurality rationalizes its haste to forgo an evidentiary record by noting that ""the parties have treated the question as a purely legal one."" ante, at 14, n. 4. but without a doubt, the legal question—whether the aggregate limits are closely drawn to further a compelling governmental interest—turns on factual questions about whether corruption, in the absence of such limits, is a realistic threat to our democracy. the plurality itself spends pages citing figures about campaign spending to defend its ""legal"" conclusion. ante, at 24-26, 27-28, 30-32. the problem with such reasoning is that this court's expertise does not lie in marshaling facts in the primary instance. that is why in the past, when answering similar questions about the constitutionality of restrictions on campaign contributions, we have relied on an extensive evidentiary record produced below to inform our decision.  without further development of the record, however, i fail to see how the plurality can now find grounds for overturning buckley. the justification for aggregate contribution restrictions is strongly rooted in the need to assure political integrity and ultimately in the first amendment itself. part ii, supra. the threat to that integrity posed by the risk of special access and influence remains real. part iii, supra. even taking the plurality on its own terms and considering solely the threat of quid pro quo corruption (i.e., money-for-votes exchanges), the aggregate limits are a necessary tool to stop circumvention. ibid. and there is no basis for finding a lack of ""fit"" between the threat and the means used to combat it, namely the aggregate limits. part iv, supra.  the plurality reaches the opposite conclusion. the result, as i said at the outset, is a decision that substitutes judges' understandings of how the political process works for the understanding of congress; that fails to recognize the difference between influence resting upon public opinion and influence bought by money alone; that overturns key precedent; that creates huge loopholes in the law; and that undermines, perhaps devastates, what remains of campaign finance reform.  with respect, i dissent.  appendixes  a  existence of large donations  expert report: ""during the 1996 election cycle, the top 50 nonfederal money donors made contributions ranging from $530,000 to $3,287,175. . . . soft money financing of party campaigning exploded in the 2000 election cycle. soft money spending by the national parties reached $498 million, now 42% of their total spending. raising a half billion dollars in soft money   took a major effort by the national parties and elected officials, but they had the advantage of focusing their efforts on large donors. . . . the top 50 soft money donors . . . each contributed between $955,695 and $5,949,000."" 251 f. supp. 2d, at 440 (opinion of kollar-kotelly, j.)

republican national committee, the democratic national committee, the national republican senatorial committee, the democratic senatorial campaign committee, the national republican congressional committee, and the democratic congressional campaign committee. see 2 u. s. c. §431(14).    a pac is a business, labor, or interest group that raises or spends money in connection with a federal election, in some cases by contributing to candidates. a so-called ""super pac"" is a pac that makes only independent expenditures and cannot contribute to candidates. the base and aggregate limits govern contributions to traditional pacs, but not to independent expenditure pacs. see speechnow.org v. federal election comm'n, 599 f. 3d 686, 695-696 (cadc 2010) (en banc).    a multicandidate pac is a pac with more than 50 contributors that has been registered for at least six months and has made contributions to five or more candidates for federal office. 11 cfr §100.5(e)(3) (2012). pacs that do not qualify as multicandidate pacs must abide by the base limit applicable to individual contributions.    the dissent contends that we should remand for development of an evidentiary record before answering the question with which we were presented. see post, at 28-30 (opinion of breyer, j). but the parties have treated the question as a purely legal one, and the government has insisted that the aggregate limits can be upheld under the existing record alone. see tr. of oral arg. 43, 55-56. we take the case as it comes to us.    see, e.g., felsenthal, obama attends fundraiser hosted by jay-z, beyonce, reuters, sept. 18, 2012; coleman, kid rock supports paul ryan at campaign fundraiser, rolling stone, aug. 25, 2012; mason, robert duvall to host romney fundraiser, l. a. times, july 25, 2012; piazza, hillary lands 2.5m with rocket man, n. y. daily news, apr. 10, 2008, p. 2.    the fact that this opinion does not address the base limits also belies the dissent's concern that we have silently overruled the court's holding in mcconnell v. federal election comm'n, 540 u. s. 93 (2003). see post, at 12-13. at issue in mcconnell was bcra's extension of the base limits to so-called ""soft money""—previously unregulated contributions to national party committees. see 540 u. s., at 142; see also post, at 31-38 (appendix a to opinion of breyer, j.) (excerpts from mcconnell record discussing unregulated ""soft money""). our holding about the constitutionality of the aggregate limits clearly does not overrule mcconnell's holding about ""soft money.""    it would be especially odd to regard aggregate limits as essential to enforce base limits when state campaign finance schemes typically include base limits but not aggregate limits. just eight of the 38 states that have imposed base limits on contributions from individuals to candidates have also imposed aggregate limits (excluding restrictions on a specific subset of donors). see conn. gen. stat. §9-611(c) (2013); me. rev. stat. ann., tit. 21-a, §1015(3) (supp. 2013); md. elec. law code ann. §13-226(b) (lexis supp. 2013); mass. gen. laws, ch. 55, §7a(a)(5) (west 2012); n. y. elec. law ann. §14-114(8) (west supp. 2013); r. i. gen. laws §17-25-10.1(a)(1) (lexis 2013); wis. stat. §11.26(4) (2007-2008); wyo. stat. ann. §22-25-102(c)(ii) (2013). the government presents no evidence concerning the circumvention of base limits from the 30 states with base limits but no aggregate limits.    even those premises are generous because they assume that the donor contributes to non-multicandidate pacs, which are relatively rare. multicandidate pacs, by contrast, must have more than 50 contributors. 11 cfr §100.5(e)(3). the more contributors, of course, the more the donor's share in any eventual contribution to smith is diluted.    the justice department agrees. as acting assistant attorney general mythili raman recently testified before congress: ""we anticipate seeing fewer cases of conduit contributions directly to campaign committees or parties, because individuals or corporations who wish to influence elections or officials will no longer need to attempt to do so through conduit contribution schemes that can be criminally prosecuted. instead, they are likely to simply make unlimited contributions to super pacs or 501(c)s."" hearing on current issues in campaign finance law enforcement before the subcommittee on crime and terrorism of the senate committee on the judiciary, 113th cong., 1st sess., 3 (2013).    in addition, the percentage of contributions above the aggregate limits that even could be used for circumvention is limited by the fact that many of the modes of potential circumvention can be used only once each election. for example, if one donor gives $2,600 to 100 candidates with safe house seats in the hopes that each candidate will reroute $2,000 to representative smith, a candidate in a contested district, no other donor can do the same, because the candidates in the safe seats will have exhausted their permissible contributions to smith. so there is no risk that the circumvention scheme will repeat itself with multiple other would-be donors to smith.
