one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nOooo-aaaah, oooo-aaaah\nOoooh, ooooh, oh wah\n\n[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]\nAnd you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking\nRacing around to come up behind you again\nThe sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older\nShorter of breath and one day closer to death\nEvery year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time (Oooo-aaaah, aaa-haaa)\nPlans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines (Oooo-aaaah, oh woa-ho)\nHanging on in quiet desperation is the English way (Ooooh)\nThe time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say (Oooo-aaaah)\n\n[Outro/Breathe (Reprise): David Gilmour, with Richard Wright]\nHome, home again\nI like to be here when I can\nAnd when I come home cold and tired\nIt's good to warm my bones beside the fire\nFar away across the field\nThe tolling of the iron bell\nCalls the faithful to their knees\nTo

read about his widowed bride\nBut something touched me deep inside\nThe day the music died\n[Chorus]\nSo bye-bye, Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nAnd them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nSingin', \"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nDid you write the book of love\nAnd do you have faith in God above\nIf the Bible tells you so?\nNow do you believe in rock 'n' roll\nCan music save your mortal soul\nAnd can you teach me how to dance real slow?\nWell, I know that you're in love with him\n'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym\nYou both kicked off your shoes\nMan, I dig those rhythm and blues\nI was a lonely teenage broncin' buck\nWith a pink carnation and a pickup truck\nBut I knew I was out of luck\nThe day the music died\n\n[Chorus]\nI started singin', \"Bye-bye, Miss American Pie\"\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nAnd singin', \"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\"This'll be the day that I die\"\nSee Don McLean LiveGet tickets as low as $100You might also like[Verse 2]\nNow, for ten years we've been on our own\nAnd moss grows fat on a rollin' stone\nBut that's not how it used to be\nWhen the jester sang for the king and queen\nIn a coat he borrowed from James Dean\nAnd a voice that came from you and me\nOh, and while the king was looking down\nThe jester stole his thorny crown\nThe courtroom was adjourned\nNo verdict was returned\nAnd while Lennon read a book on Marx\nThe quartet practiced in the park\nAnd we sang dirges in the dark\nThe day the music died\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were singin', \"Bye-bye, Miss American Pie\"\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nAnd singin', \"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nHelter skelter in a summer swelter\nThe birds flew off with a fallout shelter\nEight miles high and fallin' fast\nIt landed foul on the grass\nThe players tried for a forward pass\nWith the jester on the sidelines in a cast\nNow, the half-time air was sweet perfume\nWhile the sergeants played a marching tune\nWe all got up to dance\nOh, but we never got the chance\n'Cause the players tried to take the field\nThe marching band refused to yield\nDo you recall what was revealed\nThe day the music died?\n[Chorus]\nWe started singin', \"Bye-bye, Miss American Pie\"\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nAnd singin', \"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\n[Verse 4]\nOh, and there we were, all in one place\nA generation lost in space\nWith no time left to start again\nSo come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick\nJack Flash sat on a candlestick\n'Cause fire is the devil's only friend\nOh, and as I watched him on the stage\nMy hands were clenched in fists of rage\nNo angel born in hell\nCould break that Satan's spell\nAnd as the flames climbed high into the night\nTo light the sacrificial rite\nI saw Satan laughing with delight\nThe day the music died\n\n[Chorus]\nHe was singin', \"Bye-bye Miss American Pie\"\nDrove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry\nThem good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nAnd singin', \"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\"This'll be the day that I die...\"\n\n[Breakdown]\nI met a girl who sang the blues\nAnd I asked her for some happy news\nBut she just smiled and turned away\nI went down to the sacred store\nWhere I'd heard the music years before\nBut the man there said the music wouldn't play\nAnd in the streets, the children screamed\nThe lovers cried and the poets dreamed\nBut not a word was spoken\nThe church bells all were broken\nAnd the three men I admire most\nThe Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost\nThey caught the last train for the coast\nThe day the music died\n[Deleted Verse]\nAnd there I stood alone and afraid\nI dropped to my knees and there I prayed\nAnd I promised Him everything I could give\nIf only He would make the music live\nAnd He promised it would live once more\nBut this time one would equal four\nAnd in five years four had come to mourn\nAnd the music was reborn\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd they were singin', \"Bye-bye Miss American Pie\"\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\nAnd them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nSingin', \"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\"This'll be the day that I die\"\n\n[Outro]\nThey were singin', \"Bye-bye Miss American Pie\"\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\nThem good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye\nSingin', \"This'll be the day that I die...\"125Embed"}, {"name": "Hells Bells",

Etienne Rambert looked at his watch and found, as he had anticipated, that he had a good quarter of an hour before the train that he intended to take was due to start. He called a porter, and gave him the heavy valise and the bundle of rugs that formed the whole of his hand baggage.\n\n\"Where is the office for forwarding luggage, my man?\" he enquired.\n\nThe porter led him through the famous panelled hall of the Gare d'Orsay, and M. Etienne Rambert satisfied himself that his trunks had been properly registered for Verri\u00e8res, the station at which he had to alight for the ch\u00e2teau of Beaulieu.\n\nStill attended by the porter, who had conceived a respectful admiration for him in consequence of the authoritative tone in which he demanded information from the various railway servants, and who scented a probable munificent tip, M. Etienne Rambert proceeded to the booking-office and took a first-class ticket. He spent a few minutes more at the book-stall where he selected an imposing collection of illustrated papers, and then, his final preparations completed, he turned once more to the porter.\n\n\"The Luchon train,\" he said; \"where is it?\" and as the man only made a vague gesture and growled something wholly indistinct, he added: \"Lead the way, and I will follow.\"\n\nIt was now just half-past eight, and the station showed all the animation inseparable from the departure of main-line trains. M. Etienne Rambert hurried onwards, and reaching the platform from which all the lines begin, was stayed by the porter who was laden with his baggage.\n\"You want the express, sir?\"\n\n\"No, the slow train, my man.\"\n\nThe porter showed some surprise, but made no remark.\n\n\"Do you like the front or the back of the train?\"\n\n\"The back by choice.\"\n\n\"First-class, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, first-class.\"\n\nThe porter, who had stopped a moment, picked up the heavy valise again.\n\n\"Then there isn't any choice. There are only two first-class carriages on the slow train, and they are both in the middle.\"\n\n\"They are corridor carriages, I suppose?\" said Etienne Rambert.\n\n\"Yes, sir; there are hardly any others on the main-line trains, especially first-class.\"\n\nIn the ever-increasing crowd Etienne Rambert had some difficulty in following the porter. The Gare d'Orsay has little or none of the attractiveness of the other stations, which cannot fail to have a certain fascination for any imaginative person, who thinks of the mystery attaching to all those iron rails reaching out into the distance of countries unknown to him. It is less noisy than the others also, for between Austerlitz and Orsay the traction is entirely electric. And further, there is no clearly defined separation between the main and the suburban lines.\n\nOn the right of the platform was the train which was to take Etienne Rambert beyond Brives to Verri\u00e8res, the slow train to Luchon; and on the left of the same platform was another train for Juvisy and all the small stations in the suburbs of Paris.\nVery few people were making for the train to Luchon; but a large crowd was pressing into the suburban train.\n\nThe porter who was piloting M. Etienne Rambert, set the baggage he was carrying down on the footboard of a first-class carriage.\n\n\"There is no one for the slow train yet, sir; if you like to get in first you can choose your own compartment.\"\n\nM. Etienne Rambert acted on the suggestion, but he had hardly set foot in the corridor before the guard, also scenting a generous tip, came to offer his services.\n\n\"It really is the 8.50 you want, sir?\" was his first enquiry. \"You are sure you are not making a mistake?\"\n\n\"No,\" Etienne Rambert replied. \"Why?\"\n\n\"A great many first-class passengers do make a mistake,\" the man explained, \"and confuse the 8.50 with the 8.45 express.\"\n\nAs he spoke the guard took the baggage from the porter who had remained on the platform, and the porter, after being generously remunerated for his trouble by M. Rambert, hurried away to look for other travellers.\n\n\"The 8.45 is the express, isn't it?\" M. Rambert enquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" the guard answered; \"it runs right through without stopping at all the small stations as this train does. It goes in front of this one and gets to Luchon three hours earlier. There it is on the side there,\" and he pointed through the window in the door on the far side to another train on the next rails, in which a number of travellers were already taking their seats. \"If you prefer to go by that one, sir,\" he went on, \"there is still time for you to change; you are entitled to take your choice since you have a first-class ticket.\"\n\nBut Etienne Rambert, after a moment's consideration, declined the suggestion.\n\n\"No: I would rather go by the slow train. If I take the express I should have to get out at Brives, and then I should be twelve or thirteen miles from Saint-Jaury, which is my destination; whereas the slow train stops at Verri\u00e8res, where, by the way, I have already telegraphed to say I shall arrive to-morrow morning.\"\n\nHe walked a little way along the corridor, assuring himself that the various compartments were still quite empty, and then turned to the guard.\n\"Look here, my man,\" he said, \"I am awfully tired, and I mean to get some sleep to-night; consequently I should like to be alone. Now where shall I be most quiet and undisturbed?\"\n\nThe man understood. M. Etienne Rambert's enquiry about the place where he would be most quiet, was an implicit promise of a handsome tip if nobody did disturb him.\n\n\"If you like to settle yourself here, sir,\" the man answered, \"you can draw down the blinds at once, and I dare say I shall be able to find room for any other passengers somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said M. Rambert, moving towards the compartment indicated. \"I will smoke a cigar until the train starts, and immediately afterwards I will settle down to sleep. By the way, my man, since you seem so obliging, I wish you would undertake to call me to-morrow morning in time for me to get out at Verri\u00e8res. I am desperately sleepy and I am quite capable of not waking up.\"\n\nThe guard touched his cap.\n\n\"You can be perfectly easy, sir, and sleep without the least anxiety. I won't fail.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nWhen his baggage had been stowed away, and his rugs spread out to make the seat more comfortable still, M. Etienne Rambert repeated his appeal, for he was an old traveller and knew that it does not do to rely too much upon the promises of chance attendants.\n\n\"I can rely upon you, can't I? I may sleep as sound as I like, and you will wake me at Verri\u00e8res?\" And the more to assure himself that the guard would execute his orders he slipped a franc into his hand.\n\nWhen he was left alone, M. Rambert continued his preparations for the night. He carefully drew down the blinds over the door and over the windows of the compartment that gave on to the corridor, and also lowered the shade over the electric light, and then, in order to enjoy the last puffs at his cigar in peace, he opened the window over the other door and leant his elbows on it, watching the final preparations being made by the travellers by the express on the other line.\n\nThe departure of a train is always a picturesque sight, and M. Rambert leant forward inquisitively to note how the passengers had installed themselves in the two compartments which he could see from his coign of vantage.\n\nThere were not many people in the train. As a matter of fact the Brives and Luchon line is not much used at this time of year. If the number of passengers in the express were any criterion Etienne Rambert might reasonably expect that he would be the only one in the slow train. But there was not much time for observations and reflections of this kind. On the platform for the express, which he got a glimpse of through the compartments, people were hurrying up their farewells. The passengers had got into their carriages, and the friends who had come to see them off were standing alone upon the platform. There was the sound of safety locks being fastened by porters, and the noise of trollies being wheeled along bearing articles for sale.\n\n\"Pillows! Rugs! Sweets! Papers!\"\n\nThen came the whistle of the guard, the shriller scream from the electric engine, and then, slowly at first but steadily, more rapidly as the engine got up speed, the express moved along the platform and plunged into the tunnel on the way to Austerlitz.\n\nMeanwhile the guard of the slow train was doing wonders. Shamelessly resolved to assure perfect quiet to \"his\" passenger, he managed, without unduly compromising himself but yet without leaving any doubt about it in any mind, to insinuate discreetly that M. Rambert's carriage was reserved, so that that gentleman might count upon an entirely undisturbed night.\n\nA few minutes after the express had gone, the slow train drew out in its turn, and disappeared into the darkness of the underground tunnel.\n\nAt the ch\u00e2teau of Beaulieu young Charles Rambert was just finishing dressing when a gentle tap sounded on the door of his room.\n\n\"It is a quarter to five, Charles. Get up at once!\"\n\n\"I am awake already, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se,\" Charles Rambert answered with some pride. \"I shall be ready in two minutes.\"\n\n\"What? up already?\" the girl exclaimed from the other side of the door. \"Marvelous! I congratulate you. I'm ready too; I will wait for you in the dining-room. Come down as soon as you are dressed.\"\n\n\"All right!\" the young man answered.\n\nHe wasted no time over his toilette, the more so because it was none too warm in his room, for at this early hour it was still quite dark; and then taking his light in one hand he opened his door carefully so as to make no noise, tip-toed along the landing, and went down the staircase to join Th\u00e9r\u00e8se in the dining-room. The girl was an accomplished housekeeper already, and while waiting for the young fellow she had got a scratch meal together.\n\n\"Let us have breakfast quickly,\" she suggested; \"it isn't snowing this morning, and if you like we might walk to the station. We have plenty of time, and it will do us good to have a walk.\"\n\n\"It will warm us up anyhow,\" Charles Rambert replied; he was only half-awake, but he sat beside Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and did justice to the preparations she had made.\n\n\"Do you know that it is very wonderful of you to get up so punctually?\" Mme. de Langrune's granddaughter remarked. \"How did you manage it? Last night you were afraid you would sleep on as usual.\"\n\n\"It was not much trouble for me to wake up,\" Charles Rambert answered. \"I hardly closed an eye all night.\"\n\n\"But I promised to come and knock at your door myself, so you might have slept without any anxiety.\"\n\n\"That's so, but to tell you the truth, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, I was regularly upset and excited by the thought of papa arriving this morning.\"\n\nThey had both finished breakfast, and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se got up.\n\n\"Shall we start?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se opened the hall door, and the two young people went down the flight of steps leading to the garden. The girl had thrown a big cloak over her shoulders, and she inhaled the pure morning air with keen delight.\n\n\"I love going out in the early morning,\" she declared.\n\n\"Well, I don't like it at all,\" Charles Rambert confessed with characteristic candour. \"Good Lord, how cold it is! And it is still pitch dark!\"\n\n\"Surely you are not going to be frightened?\" said Th\u00e9r\u00e8se teasingly.\n\nCharles Rambert made an irritable movement of vexation and surprise.\n\n\"Frightened? What do you take me for, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se? If I don't like going out in the early morning it's really only because it is cold.\"\n\nShe laughed at him while they were crossing the lawn towards the out-buildings, through which she meant to get out on to the high road. As they passed the stables they came across a groom who was leisurely getting an old brougham out of the coach-house.\n\n\"Don't hurry, Jean,\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se called out as she greeted him. \"We are going to walk to the station, and the only important thing is that you should be there to bring us back.\"\n\nThe man touched his cap and the two young people passed through the park gate and found themselves upon the high road.\n\nIt was still very dark, with just a wan reflection in the distance of the sky vaguely outlining some cloud-shapes to the eastward to give some promise of the day. There was no sound to break the silence of the fields, and as they walked briskly along Charles and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se could hear their footsteps ringing on the hard surface of the frozen ground.\n\n\"It must please you awfully to be going to meet your father,\" said Mme. de Langrune's granddaughter half questioningly. \"It is a long time since you have seen him, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Three years,\" Charles Rambert answered, \"and then just for a few minutes. He is coming home from America now, and before that he travelled in Spain for a long time.\"\n\n\"He was travelling the whole time you were a child, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, always: either in Colombia, looking after his rubber plantations there, or in Spain, where he has a good deal of property too. When he was in Paris he used to come to the school and ask for me, and I saw him in the parlour\u2014for a quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"And your mother?\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma was different. You know, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, I spent all  the childhood that I can remember at the school. I liked the masters and had good chums, and was very happy there, and if the truth must be told I looked forward with anything but pleasure to the holidays, when I had to go to my parents' house. I always felt a stranger with them; my real home was the school-room, where I had my desk and all my own interests. And then, you know, when one is little one doesn't understand things much; I didn't feel having hardly any family, very much.\"\n\n\"But you loved your mother very much?\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se asked the question quite anxiously, and it was patent that she would have thought it dreadful if her companion had not had a real affection for his mother.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I loved her,\" Charles Rambert answered; \"but I hardly knew her either.\" And as Th\u00e9r\u00e8se showed her surprise he went on, telling her something of the secret of his lonely childhood. \"You see, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, now that I am a man I guess lots of things that I could not have had even a suspicion of then. My father and mother did not get on well together. They were what you call an ill-assorted couple. They were both very good, but their characters did not harmonise. When I was little I always saw mamma silent and sad, and papa active and on the go, and bright and talking at the top of his voice. I half believe he frightened mamma! And then my father was constantly away, whereas mamma hardly ever went out. When a servant took me to the house on Thursdays, I was taken up to say good morning to her, and I invariably found her lying on a sofa in her room, with the blinds down and almost dark. She just touched me with her lips and asked me one or two questions, and then I was taken away again because I tired her.\"\n\n\"Was she ill, then?\"\n\n\"Mamma always has been ill. I suppose you know, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, that three months ago\u2014stay, it was just when I had taken my degree and went to Germany\u2014she was sent to an asylum? I believe my father had wanted her to agree to undergo careful treatment of the kind long before, but she would not.\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se was silent for a few minutes.\n\n\"You have not been very happy,\" she said presently.\n\n\"Oh, it was only after I grew up that I felt unhappy. When I was a little chap I never thought of how sad it is to have no real father or mother. The last four or five years it has hurt me, but when he came to see me once at school, papa told me he would take me with him as soon as I had taken my degree and grown up. Last October, after my examination, he wrote and told me to be patient a little longer, and that he was hurrying on with the winding up of his business and coming back to France. That gave me a hope which has brightened these last few months, and will also make you understand why I am so pleased this morning at my fathers coming. It seems to me that a new life is going to begin.\"\n\nDay was breaking now: a dirty December day, with the light filtering through heavy grey clouds that drifted along the ground, hid the horizon, clung to the low hills, and then suddenly dispersed in long wisps driven by a keen breeze, that got up in gusts, and drove clouds of dust along the hard frozen ground.\n\n\"I have not been very happy either,\" said Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, \"for I lost my father when I was tiny: I don't even remember him; and mamma must be dead as well.\"\n\nThe ambiguous turning of the child's phrase caught Charles Rambert's interested attention.\n\n\"What does that mean, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se? Don't you know if your mother is dead?\"\n\n\"Yes, oh yes; grandmamma says so. But whenever I ask for particulars grandmamma always changes the subject. I will echo what you said just now: when you are little you don't know anything and are not surprised at anything. For a long time I took no notice of her sudden reticence, but now I sometimes wonder if something is not being kept back from me\u2014whether it is really true that mamma is no more in this world.\"\n\nTalking like this Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Charles had walked at a good pace, and now they came to the few houses built around Verri\u00e8res station. One by one, bedroom windows and doors were being opened; peasants were making their way to the sheds to lead their cattle to the pastures.\n\n\"We are very early,\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se remarked, pointing to the station clock in the distance. \"Your father's train is due at 6.55, and it is only 6.40 now; we still have a quarter of an hour to wait, and more, if the train is not punctual!\"\n\nThey went into the little station and Charles Rambert, thankful for some shelter from the cold, stamped his feet, making a sudden uproar in the empty waiting-room. A porter appeared.\n\n\"Who the deuce is kicking up all this row?\" he began angrily, and then seeing Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, broke off short. \"Ah, Mademoiselle Th\u00e9r\u00e8se,\" he said with the familiar yet perfectly respectful cordiality that marks country folk, \"up already? Have you come to meet somebody, or are you going away?\"\n\nAs he spoke, the porter turned a curious eye upon Charles Rambert, whose arrival had caused quite a sensation two days before in this little spot, where with but few exceptions none but people belonging to the neighbourhood ever came by train.\n\n\"No, I am not going away,\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied. \"I have accompanied M. Rambert, who has come to meet his father.\"\n\n\"Ah-ha, to meet your papa, sir: is he coming from far?\"\n\n\"From Paris,\" Charles Rambert answered. \"Is the train signalled yet?\"\n\nThe man drew out a watch like a turnip, and looked at the time.\n\n\"It won't be here for quite another twenty minutes. The work on the tunnel makes it necessary to be careful, and it's always late now. But you will hear when the bell rings: that will be when the train is coming over the level-crossing; it will run into the station three minutes after that. Well, Mademoiselle, I must get on with my work,\" and the man left them.\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se turned to Charles Rambert.\n\n\"Shall we go on to the platform? Then we shall see the train come in.\"\n\nSo they left the waiting-room and began to walk up and down the whole length of the platform. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se watched the jerky movements of the hands of the clock, and smiled at her companion.\n\n\"Five minutes more, and your father will be here! Four minutes more! Ah! There it is!\" and she pointed to a slope in the distance where a slight trail of smoke rose white against the blue of the sky, now clear of cloud. \"Can't you see it? That is the steam from the engine coming out of the tunnel.\"\n\nEre she finished speaking the quivering whir of the bell echoed through the empty station.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Charles Rambert: \"at last!\"\n\nThe two porters who, with the stationmaster, constituted the entire railway staff at Verri\u00e8res, came bustling along the platform, and while the bell continued its monotonous whirring ring, pulled forward trucks in readiness for any possible luggage. Puffing portentously, the engine slackened speed, and the heavy train slowed down and finally stopped, bringing a noisy atmosphere of life into the station of Verri\u00e8res that but a moment ago was so still.\n\nThe first-class carriages had stopped immediately in front of Charles and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and on the footboard Etienne Rambert stood, a tall, elderly man of distinguished appearance, proud bearing and energetic attitude, with extraordinarily keen eyes and an unusually high and intelligent forehead. Seeing Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Charles he seized his baggage and in a twinkling had sprung on to the platform. He dropped his valise, tossed his bundle of rugs on to a seat, and gripped Charles by the two shoulders.\n\n\"My boy!\" he exclaimed; \"my dear boy!\"\n\nAlthough he had hitherto shown so little affection for his child, it was obvious that the man was making a great effort to restrain his emotion, and was really moved when he now saw him again as a grown young man.\n\nNor, on his part, did Charles Rambert remain unmoved. As if the sudden grip of this almost stranger, who yet was his father, had awakened a world of memories within him, he turned very pale and his voice faltered as he replied:\n\n\"Papa! Dear papa! I am so glad to see you!\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se had drawn tactfully aside. M. Rambert still held his son by the shoulders and stepped back a pace, the better to consider him.\n\n\"Why, you are a man! How you have altered, my boy! You are just what I hoped you would be: tall and strong! Ah, you are my son all right! And you are quite well, hey? Yet you look tired.\"\n\n\"I did not sleep well,\" Charles explained with a smile. \"I was afraid I should not wake up.\"\n\nTurning his head, M. Rambert saw Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and held out his hand.\n\n\"How do you do, my little Th\u00e9r\u00e8se?\" he exclaimed. \"You have altered too since I saw you last. I left a little chit of a child, and now I behold a grown-up young lady. Well! I must be off at once to pay my respects to my dear old friend, your grandmother. All well at the ch\u00e2teau, eh?\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se shook hands warmly with M. Rambert and thanked him prettily.\n\n\"Grandmamma is very well; she told me to tell you to excuse her if she did not come to meet you, but her doctor says she must not get up very early.\"\n\n\"Of course your grandmamma is excused, my dear. Besides, I have to thank her for her kindness to Charles, and for the hospitality she is going to extend to me for a few days.\"\n\nMeanwhile the train had gone on again, and now a porter came up to M. Rambert.\n\n\"Will you take your luggage with you, sir?\"\n\nRecalled to material things, Etienne Rambert contemplated his trunk which the porters had taken out of the luggage van.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he began, but Th\u00e9r\u00e8se interrupted him.\n\n\"Grandmamma said she would send for your heavy luggage during the morning, and that you could take your valise and any small parcels with us in the brougham.\"\n\n\"What's that? Your grandmamma has taken the trouble to send her carriage?\"\n\n\"It's a long way to Beaulieu, you know,\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied. \"Ask Charles if it isn't. We came on foot and the walk would be too tiring for you after a whole night in the train.\"\n\nThe three had reached the station yard, and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se stopped in surprise.\n\n\"Why, how's that?\" she exclaimed; \"the carriage is not here.  And yet Jean was beginning to get it ready when we left the ch\u00e2teau.\"\n\nM. Etienne Rambert was resting one hand on his son's shoulder, and contemplating him with an affectionate, all-embracing survey every now and then. He smiled at Th\u00e9r\u00e8se.\n\n\"He may have been delayed, dear. I tell you what we will do. Since your grandmamma is going to send for my luggage there is no need for me to take my valise; we can leave everything in the cloak-room and start for the ch\u00e2teau on foot; if my memory serves me right\u2014and it is a very good memory\u2014there is only one road, so we shall meet Jean and can get into the carriage on the way.\"\n\nA few minutes later all three set out on the road to Beaulieu. M. Rambert walked between the two young people; he had gallantly offered his arm to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, who was not a little proud of the attention, which proved to her mind that she was now regarded as a grown-up young lady. On the other side of his father Charles made answer to the incessant questions put to him.\n\nM. Etienne Rambert enjoyed the walk in the quiet morning through the peaceful country-side. With a tender half-melancholy he recognised every turn in the road, every bit of scenery.\n\n\"Just fancy my coming back here at sixty years of age, with a great son of eighteen!\" he said with a laugh. \"And I remember as if it were yesterday the good times I have had at the ch\u00e2teau of Beaulieu. Mme. de Langrune and I will have plenty of memories to talk over. Gad! it must be quite forty years since I came this way, and yet I remember every bit of it. Say, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, isn't it the fact that we shall see the front of the ch\u00e2teau directly we have passed this little copse?\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" the girl answered with a laugh. \"You know the country very well, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Etienne Rambert; \"when one gets to my age, little Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, one always does remember the happy days of one's youth; one remembers recent events much less distinctly. Most likely that means, my dear, that the human heart declines to grow old and refuses to preserve any but pictures of childhood.\"\n\nFor a few minutes M. Rambert remained silent, as if absorbed in somewhat melancholy reflections. But he soon recovered himself and shook off the tender sadness evoked in his mind by memories of the past.\n\n\"Why, the park enclosure has been altered,\" he exclaimed. \"Here is a wall which used not to be here: there was only a hedge.\"\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se laughed.\n\n\"I never knew the hedge,\" she said. \"I have always seen the wall.\"\n\n\"Must we go on to the main gate?\" M. Rambert asked, \"or has your grandmamma had another gate made?\"\n\n\"We are going in by the out-buildings,\" the girl answered; \"then we shall hear why Jean did not come to meet us.\" She opened a little door half-hidden among the moss and ivy that clothed the wall surrounding the park, and making M. Rambert and Charles pass in before her, cried: \"But Jean has gone with the brougham, for the horses are not in the stable. How was it we did not meet him?\" Then she laughed. \"Poor Jean! He is so muddle-headed! I would not mind betting he went to meet us at Saint-Jaury, as he does every morning to bring me home from church.\"\n\nThe little company, Etienne Rambert, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Charles, were now approaching the ch\u00e2teau. Passing beneath Mme. de Langrune's windows Th\u00e9r\u00e8se called merrily up to them.\n\n\"Here we are, grandmamma!\"\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nBut at the window of an adjoining room appeared the figure of the steward, Dollon, making a gesture, as if asking for silence.\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se, in advance of her guests, had proceeded but a few yards when Mme. de Langrune's old servant rushed down the stone flight of steps in front of the ch\u00e2teau, towards M. Rambert.\n\nDollon seemed distraught. Usually so respectful and so deferential in manner, he now seized M. Rambert by the arm, and imperiously waving Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Charles away, drew him aside.\n\n\"It is awful, sir,\" he exclaimed: \"horrible: a fearful thing has happened. We have just found Mme. la Marquise dead\u2014murdered\u2014in her room!\"Embed"}, {"name": "Believer", "artist": "Imagine Dragons", "lyrics": "Translations\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439MagyarT\u00fcrk\u00e7eEspa\u00f1olBeliever Lyrics[Verse 1]\nFirst things first\nI'ma say all the words inside my head\nI'm fired up and tired of\nThe way that things have been, oh-ooh\nThe way that things have been, oh-ooh\n\n[Verse 2]\nSecond things second\nDon't you tell me what you think that I could be\nI'm the one at the sail\nI'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh\nThe master of my sea, oh-ooh\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI was broken from a young age\nTaking my sulkin' to the masses\nWriting my poems for the few\nThat look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me\nSinging from heartache from the pain\nTaking my message from the veins\nSpeaking my lesson from the brain\nSeeing the beauty through the...\n\n[Chorus]\nPain!

six million?\nBut let me get back, to reflectin' and building on all that it happened\nSince I left the field like I was Dr. Manhattan\nI was living off of my rapping\n'till I tied the knot, then I got into a tighter spot\nThen I had to find a job\nBut\nWait, sorry fuck\nSo Diz', a job is a place where you go to make money\nLike an office or store\nYou ever seen The Office before?\nIt's like that, but less funny\nAnd then you get a check\nYou can spend it on your food and ya rent\nFuck, I'm doing it again\nSo Diz', rent...\nI'll take it slow\nSee rent is this thing where you know find a place, and you pay money to stay monthly\nSee, I ain't know if you're aware of it, because you ain't left your parents till your fuckin' late 20s\nSo according to you, right, on Twitter you called me a \"manchild\"\nThe audacity!\nThat you, mister level headed adult\nYOU called me a \"manchild\" that is damn wild\nYou were living with your mom and dad while\nI was in my own crib, diggin' up dirt on QP for that damn file\nBack to that Iron battle, you know I gotta say\nThe angle about Jews not going to work on 9/11, kinda clever\nExcept you didn't go to work on 9-- ever\nSee down the line I went through shit\nMy crew split\nAs too did my creative drive, my will to stay alive took a huge dip\nAnd my momma got too sick\nDown to a toothpick\nAnd I stopped makin' music\nSee the sad thing is Diz, you said I tried and I flopped\nNah, it was going fine, then I stopped\nIt was painful, truly\nSee, I know it sounds sad, but Soul is still a Joker though\nI ain't talking about the Gotham kind\nTalking like Persona 5\nThat is what I was personified\nCause I lost track of all the kind of monsters I had caught inside\nEspecially the one whisperin' to me that I oughta die\nSo bottom line, there is nothing you can say to me\nThat is more evil than the shit I used to tell myself all the time\nI got out that coma I been frozen lately\nI gotta thanks all the homies that could motivate me\nEven though the road was shaky\nLike the way Dizaster's parents thought it was okay to hold a baby\nSo now y'all here to see my return to the format\nYou here to be my personal doormat\nHold up\nBefore we go all that\nDo battle rappers still say dumb shit like \"you catch a shell, then you sleep like Squirtle and Snorlax\"?\nNo, good\nWell ignore that, fantastic\nYou know, I respect you Diz, because you're willing to give someone the shirt off your back\nEven when they didn't need it, or were asking you for that\nHe takes his shirt off all the time\nAnd I know you like to make fun of the way I make apologies\nLot of liberals are faker than astrology\nI'm not a liberal, I'm a leftist, and the difference is tremendous\nAnd there's one thing I have to say, it's gotta be legit\nI am sorry, for every bomb that Israel has ever launched at Lebanon\nThey always got a reason and each of them is fucking extra wrong\nThe IDF level houses, you know, bring fiery death on thousands\nMaybe someone you knew\nNah I ain't pushing no button, but, Israeli government always said they do it in the name of the Jews\nThis ain't a angle or a gimmick, fuck the haters and the cynics\nBut I refuse to accept that any Jew is protected by doing something so fuckin' hateful to you\nOn top of all that\nAnd all the while, the West Bank has gotten terrorized\nEvery day in Gaza's genocide\nAnd America could end it by threatening to ends its ties\nBut they just always defend it\nAnd the Palestinians get left to die\nAt this point, Diz probably thinkin'\nThis ain't therapy\nDiz, that ain't fair to me\nBecause I gotta grapple in my disgrace\nAnd my old battles are like your face, they've aged terribly\nAnd to everybody, to all you who suggested; \"No SJW stuff\"\nI've reviewed your request, and, shut the fuck up!\nI know they hate it when I do this, but sorry, I'm accountable\nSo, I am sorry if I have hurt anyone who was marginalized with the words that I'd use\nEspecially cause it doesn't reflect my personal views\nI fucked up so much\nAnd that's being accountable\nBeing a fuckin' shithead is not a fuckin' alpha move\nAnd it's like fuckin', and I'm not talkin' about like some light politeness like not talking when ya mouth is full\n[Dizaster] I'm the only one reacting\n\n[Soul Khan]\nAnd that's why it's the best line\nSee what you refer to as political correctness is just giving some respect for a minute or a second, it's forethought\nAnd if you dismiss and reject it\nCause you think it's makes you different or you're edgy\nYou're not\nSo, what to do?\nDiz, what are your preferred gender pronouns?\nUsually say like he, him, his, whatever\nSo mine are he, him, his\nLook at how easy that it is\nIt only takes fuckin' two seconds\nBut all these anti PC motherfuckers will complain for hours about it\nAnd how PC it is\nSo let me make the math\nThere are more than two genders, your eyebrows look like two sweaters\nDisgustingly huge pairs, fuck tweezers, use Nair\nI bet the effort it takes to groom is tremendous\nIf you have one square up there, you'd win at Tetris\nI mean this in the kindest way\nSo what happened?\nEverything that happened after Math, I have to ask\nShould I be scared of you?\nOr do you only attack me if I dare you to?\nDiz, Diz, c'mon man, are you, wait a second\nAm I getting this right\nWill you do anything to anybody dares you to?\nAre you sure?\nChallenge accepted\nToo bad\nConsent negative, my bad\nAlright so, JK, you can't be that, don't do that, always say that\nAnyway so, challenge accepted\nDiz...I dare you to kiss me\nI mean my man\nI ain't pausin' shit, I ain't pausin' shit\nIn 2019, we past pausin'\nHold up, hold up\nCan anyone else do this shit\nIt ain't scary or risky\nGo back to the hotel, share some whisky\nMy girl's okay with it\nC'mon tough guy, you gon' kiss me or not?\nC'mon!

wanna use Sega\nYour coif is a mess dawg\nOut there looking like Islamic the Hedgehog\nWait a second though, I'm sensitive to this shit\nIs that offensive to y'all, or the, you watching at home\nCause I felt it was like borderline\nSorta like when Madness called me Jew-Pac Shalom\nWhich is funny-\nDiz, my friend is\nIs it offensive to you Diz?\nMight be a reason to pretend that it is\nWe both know a secret\nYou oughta know\nLet me take you back\nI recently remembered\nWhen you and I were at Club Excess\nIn a pit like this\nDoin' shit like this\nAnd\nDiz was saying, this and that, I wasn't listening\nYou know what Diz is like?\nIt's a thing\nThing, the moment that burned in my memory\nIs when he turned and he said to me\nYo bro, it's funny, I ain't exactly Muslim shit\nAnd I was like, what? good lord!\nDiz, are you telling us?\nThat through your entire battling career, and you've been battling for years, a third of your life, earning your stripes\nYou led us to believe that you're Muslim, and this whole motherfucking time\nYou never actually said one\nYou not exactly, I never was gonna say that\nSee he says, I never said I was a Muslim\nBut you say it in the battles, not the interviews\nBut every time the interviewer calls you Muslim, you never correct or interrupt him\nThat's disgusting\nDon't play, I ain't a bit amused\nCause--\n[Dizaster]\nI'm an offshoot of Islam, that's why\n\n[Soul Khan]\nNhhh, yeah that's debatable\nBut relatable\nSo\nWell no I'm talking in your relation on what you do\nYou misrepresent yourself to your fans and to your opponents\nI want them to take themselves back to the moments\nAnd the raps that you told em\nUsing cultural standings that ain't actually holding\nAre you of the mind that just because racist thinks all Arabs are in terror groups\nThat that makes it fair for you\nTo uphold the stereotypes of terror too?\nWhat about Muslims who aren't Arab, dude?\nYou don't know think South Asians and African Muslims get hassled at customs?\nOr that their women in hijabs and burkas are afraid of getting shot and murdered\nDue to the rise in fucking Islamic, anti-Islamic fervor?\nSo he has a rebuttal\nI'm sure that shit is subtle\nYou know a lot of the old Jewish lines I had were fucking foolish\nBut the difference between that and you is\nI'm actually fucking Jewish\nLike, this here, was his decision\nAnd now we in this position\nYou hate the cultures vultures, what are you, a religion pigeon?\nI mean obviously\nYou're Arab, so you know the language and the basic protocol\nBut you faking overall\nI guess Dizaster is just Arabic for Rachel Dolezal\nEither way, you lied so these people have no reason to even slightly believe you\nOr\nI have just freed you\nTo finally be you\nDiz, do you hear this\nDo you recognize the scheme\nSee where I'm trying to lead you\nIt's Soul Khan, from the last tribe of the Hebrews\nListen Diz, you can admit it\nHonestly, you don't wanna do it out loud\nAnd that's just too much to ask though\nThat's fine\nIf you're not Muslim, just stand here, looking like the world's stupidest asshole\nOh damnit, I'm so proud of you\nThat probably took a lot of you\nRight?\nHonestly\nI don't wanna do anything more on this verse\nBut if this contest of a honor, pride and our worth\nIt's just a motherfucking homicide in the first\nBut, if that ain't enough\nYou just get to serve me\nI don't give a fuck\nCause in 2021, your president is Bernie\n(Diz: you done?)\nI could be, hold on\nI like you just wobbling back and forth\n(Diz: c'mon pull

battle, this a race to see which one of us gon' be the first to get this guy killed\nMe, or his white guilt\nFucking Soul Khan\nI'm not the person to step to\nYeah, we gon' start off with this because honestly, I'm not here to psychologically test you\nI'm here to open up a door, for everybody to get through\nJust like a West Hollywood rest room\nIf I get mad today, I'mma just say \"F

I'm no longer racist and you gon' let me get away with it.\"\nYou a fuckin' hypocrite, contradict yourself in every statement you make\nYou just too fake to admit it\nCause you're really a closet fuckin' racist and that's why you got so many regrets\nAnd the difference between me and you is I had a clean conscious when I said it\nYou understand me?\nThis guy got nothin' but basic linguistics, he's way too simplistic\nHe gave up and quit\nJeffrey Epstein, it's clear he was never able to hang to begin with\nAw shit, this shit is painful\nHe gon' get a face full of stitches\nPaid In Full shit\nYeah, I'ma get creative with this\nYou think I hate you cause of your race?\nY'all are the chosen ones, man\nAn old generation that's bathing in riches\nI'm just mad at you cause you're the only Jew that hasn't created a business\nHow scary is this?\nMy race angles are very vicious\nI can put an end to a conversation with a Jew with two words; \"Merry Christmas\"\n\n[Round 3: Soul Khan]\nI fear like there's gotta be an explanation of the actual definition of hypocrisy\nSo, a hypocrite is someone who says one thing and does different shit\nWhereas I changed my entire life so your criticism doesn't apply\nAnd here's another thing that you should regard quick\nI didn't flop like I said, I quit music for a while\nYou're a terribly listener, no wonder your music is garbage\nYou think I'm a bigger geek than you\nMy friend, you're an anime obsessed fucking weeaboo\nI heard that got married, congratulations\nDo you call her your waifu?\nLike the awkwardest white dude\nDid you propose to her with cherry blossoms and haiku's\nIf it weren't for the fact that she probably wipes you\nI'd say, she probably feels like she got a 9th grader\nWhen she asks you to clean the bathroom, and you're like, \"you mean the Hyperbolic Time Chamber?\"\nWhat about the sex?\nIs it hotter when you roleplay\nAs Inuyasha and Kagome\nNow, do you think Diz is ever domestically violent?\nHeck no\nI'd say he never try it\nAnd every time him and his wife get into a fight, she finds a way to let go\nWhile you go in your basement and write her name in the Death Note\nDiz talks about the streets, he isn't from there\nHe's from our neighborhood, where the hot topic is that Hot Topic was replaced by Pacific Sunwear\nAnd the fact that you share a zip code with [?] just goes to show\nYou ain't naturally large, you just actually scarred\nAnd have low impulse control\nAre you okay man? you're doing okay, you'll get through with it\nAnd that's why your parents are afraid you'll share the fate of Sharon Tate\nSo every black friend of Dizaster is a professional actor that his parents paid to scare him straight\nIt's not working I think\nI have a question\nThey probably bail you out of all sorts of stupid shit that you do\nSo\nIt is, I'mma have to ask you, are you actually cool with?\nThe fact that you supported Trump and therefore backed a political movement that doesn't actually consider black people a human?\nYou okay man? you look so upset\nSo I'll say this\nLeupold good snooze, he's falling asleep, falling asleep, okay cool\nI heard your guns are lethal, popping with them tools\nCorrection, all your guns are legal, officer approved\n'cause ain't nothing more gangster than following the rules\nSomething that I noticed, when you first [?] around, you didn't spit gun bars a lot when you came into the circuit\nHow was it?\nCrafting them, waiting till they were perfect\nDid you wanna hone them even more, wait till you deserved it\nI got it now, you ain't spit gun bars cause you were waiting for a permit\nVery responsible of you\nYou always like to say that Americans have rights\nCorrection, America always has Arabs in its sights\nAmerica has rights, no America has kids in cages terrorized by ICE\nI'm telling you and asking you, man to man\nGo talk about American rights to the tombstone of Sandra Bland\nYou're a new husband, some day a prospective father\nTalk about American rights to the grandkids and kids of Eric Garner\nDiz, I agree that in many ways, Clinton would've been a evil killer\nBut the communities I work with, are truly getting hurt Diz\nAnd a lot of it is because that motherfucker Stephen Miller\nWho is it?\nOh golly shit man, Stephen Miller, the opponent by the guy you voted for\nAnd I know you changed your mind, but you can't change your time\nIt's kinda weird right now, it fucks me up a little bit\nI know this ain't your typical wordplay, work day\nBut it's a little disturbing you ain't know who Stephen Miller is, but you probably know like Piccolo's birthday\nSee, I have changed, Diz\nIt's proof, you don't agree cause you don't believe in evolution\nNo, like you don't actually believe in evolution\nLike the theory of Charles Darwin\nThe theory of evolution\nYou don't believe in evolution, it's the reason that we're human\nBut I do remember you have a thing for Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\nWell the man Schr\u00f6dinger that, conceived it and concluded it that even he fucking believed in evolution\nYou know what rhymes with Schr\u00f6dinger too?\nHe was inspired by Einstein, socialist Jew\nDiz, what you gonna do if battle rap vanishes\nAlright, what you gonna do\nWhere would you shift in your life\nI mean Real Deal is a educator\nOoops was a legislator\nFuck, what are you?\n\n{Dizaster whispers: \"a detonator\"}\n\nA son of privilege riding on a golden escalator with the social skills of a 2nd grader?\nMy man, you need to find something, to shift your life\nI still got music, just started again, [?]\nLet me give you some advice\nFind a mission that might not pay a lot but make you feel like you got skin in the fight\nHell, keep talkin' about Socialism, maybe you could join our organization DSA\nCome with us on this journey\nCause in 2021, I know you [?] about this, the president is Bernie\n\n[Round 3: Dizaster]\nAlright man that was cool...Jesus Christ\nI don't mean no offense by that by the way\nSee cracking jokes and laughing is fine\nBut let's get back to the stats and the actual signs\nYour total impact on battle rap is 12,000,000 views you have racked up online\nIn comparison I have 13,000,000 on one battle so technically one match up of mine\nHas more views on it than all your battles combined\nYeah, you have the battle in mind, but it's the cancerous kind\nThe type that thinks, \"Hmm. All these battlers are doin' is just passin' their time\nBut if they can't use this to boost their music then that can't get no shine.\"\n'Til someone shows him a picture of Tsu Surf and he takes off his glasses, \"Hmmm. I can't really see that. I'm actually blind.\"\nAnd this is how he was actin' when he was back in his prime\nI want you guys to try to imagine what he would've acted like if he actually got signed\n\"I'm Soul Khan and all you MC's are peasants!\"\nLet that sink in for a second\nAnd tell me this dude here is on my level\nWhen he hasn't even shown y'all enough love or wrote enough history\nAnd I still say this to little bro respectfully\nA two year stretch is like Bill Bellemy, that's a joke of a legacy\nSo whether he, do or don't have any respect for me\nIn the end, I'm still considered the legend on every top ten you see\nIf you even say the word \"battle rap\" my resume alone will force you to mention me\nI'm memorable because of my work ethic, of course they remember me\nThe respect we have for you is only present because we as a culture selfishly kept you alive in our collective memories\nBecause besides that you haven't done anything\nYou're prevalent cause we make your relevant and that's a closed case and a no brainer like JF Kennedy\nI'll bet you a dead president half of these people forgot your name\nBut for our sake, for our sake\n\n{Soul Khan starts laughing}\n\nOh don't laugh, cause yeah, it's okay\nThey probably forgot your name\nBut we still gotta give you a little star on battle rap's Walk Of Fame\nJust not on Hollywood Boulevard, yours would be laid down on Memory Lane\nAnd that's the realest shit anybody's ever wrote about you\nCause you wanna be this voice for the people but your body of work don't add up to what you socially amount to\nI got my crown jewels cause I show and prove strictly off ground moves\nWhile you got a status quo that exists merely cause the people around you\nSubjectively gave it it's value\nDon't you get it? Without us, you don't have you\nAnd without me, they don't have views\nSo without this battle the fans lose\nAnd if you ever question who I am to this scene, I'm everything bitch, THAT'S WHO!\nAnd you the little jokey jokey kid, who only poses a risk (wrist) when he poses like this\nUh oh, I think he's forming a flip\nHe's about to channel the inner Charron from his dick\nHe makes jokes about himself cause that's his only defense\nBut what kind of lack of testosterone is this?\nHe's gon' become some kind of leftist Hollywood director\nI can see it now, workin' on his own little script\nRelaunching new episodes: Soul Khan Presents: Zena The Warrior Prince\nThis guy went from a full blown chauvinist to an emotional bitch\nLook I understand that you regret being so homophobic but you need to get over it quick\nDon't be like Jussie Smollett now and beat yourself up over this shit\nBecause of course you're not homophobic bro, we know that\nCause you're really gay in secret\nLast time you passed out at a frat house they drew a dick on your forehead while you were sleepin'\nAnd the first thing you said when you woke up and peeped it\nWas...\"I'ma keep it.\"\nSo that's all you had? The little homophobic kiss me angle you was gonna come back with?\n\n[Soul Khan] The offer still stands\n\n[Dizaster]\nTo cover up the fact that you were consistently callin' people \"homo\" as one of your habits\nYou wanna know something bro? You know what's really gay?\nWhen they asked you if you had love for battle rap still and you answered back with, \"I don't know if I've ever had it.\"\nSoul Khan in our world, that's the definition of a {beep}\nOf course he gets no passes\nIf he recycles he should be judged like all the MC's\nHe said, \"Oh, I don't know if I can catch up on these battles to know if I'm reusing a bar or a scheme.\"\nBut that's the point dummy, it's pretty much a logical thing\nYou wouldn't have to watch 1,000,000 battles in a row if you actively cared enough to still be a part of the scene\nBut, you wouldn't have to catch up if you were here\nThat's what makes you a foreigner but what does all of this mean?\nIt means you failed as a battle rapper and you failed to go mainstream\nSo now you this lost underground backpacker that's caught in-between\nWanting to make bars or do a song where you sing\nSo Soul Khan you'll always be a man of many Willy Wonka hats but you'll never be the boss of one thing\nSo tell me, what you planning to do with all this you self deprecating Jew apologist?\nI know you're reformed now but to me you're every \"isist\" and \"ologist\" there probably is\nYou made a living off of calling people \"fruit balls\"\nYou're basically a RuPaul-ogist\nAll these things make it all too obvious\nKhan is a true Communist\nBut this is Americana, and what Khan insists on don't make no kinda sense\nWe on some reconnaissance\nYou know who my gang is Khan, don't make me Genghis Khan your shit\nDeath by a thousand cuts, I'll leave him with all kinds of body slits\nWhen the Katina leaves cuts in him deep as the Mariana Trench\nI'm fast as Mayweather, you may die now quick\nPull up on him, Maradona kick\nI'll dangle you from a cedar tree like a pinata then bat you with a fuckin' hockey stick\nAnd keep beatin' your body with it until the candy (w)rapper that's inside of you eventually falls out of it\nI fucking {beep beep beep} take a fuckin' time bomb and shove it down your esophagus\nHave you coughing up blobs of phosphorus\nSince you're a narcissist you shouldn't have a problem when someone makes you swallow your own confidence\nI'll curb stomp this Erin Brockovitch lookin' nerd\nOff of his high horse then drag him by force from his nerdy ass little work offices\nI'll put him in a dirt plot, put the Earth on top of it\nI could put him in a box or a bag but this what he gon' earn (urn) off of this\nA fermented body in a reserved spot in a fully furbished German Sarcophagus\nThis is the most violent Socialist inside your metropolis\nHe wants to strike over politics\nReady to riot outside the White House in Washington\nGetting into a dildo fight with Milo Yiannopoulos\nHe said if it wasn't for the music he might've destroyed all of us\nPssst, well let's look at the ergonomics and purpose of this worthless comment\nYour verses has always been full of meaningless words\nSo no one gives a fuck about your new learning process\nWe never got to see the work in progress\nI'm a murderous terminologist\nA wordsmith and a workaholic\nYou a dirty Socialist that never earned shit but feel like you deserve a profit\nCapital One, tell me what's in your wallet\nYou said you can't focus on battle rap cause music is your obligation\nWell let's contemplate on Khan's template\nLet's spend a moment in a world of Khan's creations\nHis ancestors used to get fucked up in Concentration Camps\nBut he stays with a camp that fucks up his concentration\nIf you ask me, I think Khan is in his own constellation\nHis concept is so convoluted and drawn far outta context\nThat for me it's confirmation, if they ever held a nomination, who had the best content\nThat Khan verse (converse) wouldn't even be in the conversation\nWho does name flips like that?\nHow many concerts has Khan conducted?\nHow many projects has he conjured up or Khan constructed?\nI'll tell y'all...nothing!\nSo of course he gonna talk about my accomplishments\nI fucked up a lot of times, those were the hands I was dealt\nBut you aspire to battle people like Aspire\nSo naturally you'll never understand how battling someone like Canibus or Cassidy felt\nBecause you packed up and left, only to return like Kim Kardashian and make an ass out yourself\nCause what you say? \"I'm done. There's no battlers left.\"\nBut a real battle rapper doesn't beg for no hand outs or never asks for no help\nI'm the man because I became a man that can stand by himself\nAnd you here cause you battling Dizaster, that's it, you don't have nothing else\nI'm on a different level, I single handedly branded myself\nI shouldn't even have to meddle (metal) with these little pussies like a chastity belt\nI'm glad I came down to Oakland to give him this ass whippin'\nHe just panders to the crowd, acts like he cares about black culture\nHe just usin' black culture to push him, he drops one line about civil rights and the whole crowd overlooks him\nBut if you really believe the whites were gentrifying your city you would've moved yourself the fuck outta Brooklyn\nYou are literally an invader on a black man's turf\nAnd you're Jewish which makes it that much worse\nLiterally, you're the problem you're trying to take out\nAnd it's the same way back in the day, the GrindTime situation played out\nYou say, \"R.I.P. PH\", but when he alive you did him like a two faced snake\nLucky for you back then the little dirt never came out\nBut I got the info and then some\nHow he was helping you get some battles back when you couldn't even get your shit done\nHe was giving you views, helping you build them back up when you couldn't get none\nHe even gave you Cortez, that was your biggest name back then\nHe matched you against him\nAnd then as soon as the opportunity to battle on URL comes\nYou left him hanging on his next event, you bailed out and you ditched him\nA straight sucker from the Maze Runner, I wanna see you climb your way outta this one\nMan, ain't no safe house or escape routes, I'm pulling out the big guns, the big ones\nThe type to make Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff run\nAK's with the twin drums\nI call 'em \"Soul Crushers\" [?] scope on top\nYour dome gettin' popped\nI put Soul in a box like Ghostbusters\nY'all remember Ghostbusters?\nDan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, when they trapped Slimmer in that little box in the beginnin'?\nHe's like, \"No. I prefer the Ghostbusters version where they casted the women.\"\nOf course Soul Khan\nAnd I like women, I love women a lot\nBut what type of women are you talking about?\nThe ones that take photos for King Of The Dot?\nWhoa, it looks like we're going straight to the source\nOh well, I guess Soul Khan is only here now because he's going through a really rough divorce\nAnd it's funny because, he come in here like he has this master plan\nOh, but y'all don't understand this fam'\nThat no matter how you slice it, we lookin' at a queenless person, this is half a man\nHe's a- half of the king he used to be, he has half of his throne\nHalf of his belongings and only half of what he owns\nSo you can talk about my marriage, I'm happily married, I don't have a problem letting that shit be known\nI'd rather be that than this fuckin' depressed little fuckin' bachelor that doesn't have a home\nBehind this fuckin' feminist curtain there's a man that's sad and alone\nHe wanted to make all the women in the world happy but he couldn't even make his own woman happy at home\nAnd she gone now\nAin't no tellin' what ya ex-bitch might do\nHe said he wants to be a black man for the activist\nHe just mad his white ass found out his wife does too\nBut hold on to hope Soul Khan your dreams might come true\nIf she really your Soul mate\nThen wait nine years and maybe she'll make a comeback just like you\nAnd he thought I was gonna have 6,000,000 Jew jokes like I was gonna talk about Hitler\nWhen he's wasted ten years of his life with a photographer chick and he still doesn't get the picture\nOr maybe he does, and the rest is just numb\nCause the relationship dipped into a dark room and eventually developed into a negative one\nRumor is, after you got married, you stopped battling cause she didn't let you\nWhich is ironic cause your timing of coming back is soon as she left you\nYou need to face the music, she left you naked and made you look stupid\nBut hey, in a way she was perfect for you cause she ended up walking away from the ring the same way that you did\nThat shit is oh so cold\nShe walked in and she told you go\nI don't know man, it sounds like she signed a record deal or something cause that chick really sold her Soul\nMaybe it's because you're always going on about Trump\nTrump this, Trump that\nTrump he did this\nRepublican that\nGovernment that, government this\nAlways up in somebody's mix\nTo the point he left no attention to the special someone he's with\nWhat part of this doesn't he get?\nYour wife left you because of this shit\nProbably had enough of you running your lip\nThen she's probably out there right now aggressively suckin' some Republican's dick\nAnd that's just the hypothetical, here's where we cause the most damage\nI'm really sorry about this ammo cause this shit gon' get volcanic\nCause it's ahh kinda ahh, I kinda heard before she wanted to be with you she wanted to be with Organik\nOh man, and that's the bro Travis\nWhen he asked you for this battle, he was like, \"Bro have it.\"\nSame way he answered you when you asked about her\nHe was like, \"Bro have it.\"\nOh man, oh fuckin' dammit\nI don't even like getting this personal, these are your tactics\nYou the one that brought up QP's baby mama\nHis son, his child support and his taxes\nYou the fuckin' one that brought up Sandusky versus Rone cause you felt like it would be so savage\nYou the one that brought up Real Deal's son in not one, but multiple matches\nSo spare me this victim bullshit, cause your karma here is solely from the role that you practice\nNow onto our parents\nYou know how mad I get when people talk about my parents\nOh man\nOh man\nNow, what about our parents bro?\nHuh? What about our parents?\nMy mom....is a math teacher\nAnd your mom is a librarian\n\n[Soul Khan] Clerk\n\n[Dizaster]\nLibrarian clerk\nBut why are we comparing them?\nBecause women teachers? They queens, they deserve all the praise\nMinimum wage they deserve all the raise\nThey the most underappreciated in a way\nThen comes your mom\nSitting behind a desk, stamping books, twiddling her thumbs all day\nA library clerk, that's why her son came out into books like a nerd\nThat's where the mother/son similarities occur\nCause my mother is a math teacher...and I came out to be a Math teacher just like her\nNow hold on\nLet me talk about my dad since everybody wants to talk about him\nMy father's dad passed away when my dad was only 19\nAlright? His name was Bachir just like me\nHe had three younger brothers, and a little sister\nSo now forced to raise them on his own, he had no chance but to look for a bigger picture\nIn 1976, my pops saved up and bought his first car\nHad it on top of the hill, just parked on it, and that's when the civil war got started\nA dude named Michel Aoun and the Christian Armed Forces dropped a bomb on it\nNow when I say \"Christian\", y'all assume that I'm Muslim, right?\nBut I'm Druze, I'm not Muslim\nBut I loved them, they my brothers\nBut back then, we was in a holy land grab over religion\nA world driven by sectarianism\nYou wouldn't the meaning of a fucked up system\nThe people where I'm from will die to live where you live in\nTo eat the food that you eat to sip the water you drink\nAnd that's the reason you saw me protesting\nBut since you a spoiled little American brat\nI'ma explain America to you through my eyes to teach you this lesson\nNow let's go back to the 70's where I left you in that last scene\nWhere Michel Aoun blew up my father's car in front of our house in Baakleen\nNow this is where he knew he had to leave if he was to expand the family tree\nBut life there was lookin' hopeless\nSo the only place that could've gave us this life was the Land Of The Free\nThis is why I love America\nBecause my dad came here to build a path just for me\nAnd after that, he went bankrupt and we moved permanently\nThose next eight years would make me everything that I am\nIn the street, playing soccer, bare feet, kickin' the can\nIn the fuckin' mud 'til the sun came down, shit that really turned a kid to a man\nBut that was when you were in Woodland Hills with this little Gameboy in ya hand\nSo you wouldn't really understand would you?\nYeah, cause all we had was to be able to go out and play\nBut as Lebanese kids we were taught to be appreciative that in a way\nEven though all we had was cold showers most of the time and four hours of electricity during the day\nI lived through this shit\nAnd through the rest of my settlement, my country would be going through this development\nNow listen, you remember how I said the dude that blew up my dad's car in the first segment?\nOkay, this is why the whole thing is relevant\nThis is the reason I said the shit\nCause that same person, 30 years later has now been elected as our president\nWe're talking about somebody who's a political war criminal who executed thousands by his hand\nHe's killed everything I love and that's the reason I wave this flag\nYou hate the president of America because I understand\nHis policies make you mad\nHe's a goof, I know, the Tweets make you sad\nBut guess what\nI hate my president because he fuckin' broke up half my nation and damn near took away my dad\nAnd listen, this is real shit\nThey wanna start a holy war with Muslims, Druze and Christians\nBut I will never go back to the ways that are old tradition\nI would rather go over there and die with them then fight with them\nThose are my brothers those are my sisters\nI look at them like they my children\nNow listen, I understand there's inequality here towards blacks in this system\nThat has nothing to do with him\nI don't care how he sees the views if they've never been used against him\nSo for what it's worth, you right, I'm not Muslim\nI am Druze, alright?\nDo you know what that means?\nThat means we are under Walid Jumblatt, we are Socialist by birth\nThat means, I can tell you firsthand that we're supposed to be the most peaceful people on Earth\nI mean, we're supposed to be peaceful at birth\nBut if you push us we can be some of the most fuckin' violent people on Earth\nAnd the point being, is that you're a fuckin' wanna-be Socialist\nYou don't know what you're screwing with\nSocialism is in my fucking bloodline and I want nothing to do with it\nBecause I know first hand bro\nTrust me, I've lived under this Socialist government shit\nI'll tell you first hand that nothing gets fixed\nThe garbage doesn't even get picked up, no one gives a fuck about shit\nBut you wouldn't understand because you an inexperienced, uncultured son of a bitch\nThis ain't about the joke you living or the votes you gettin' in the real world people carry guns then die over Socialism\nYou want us to live in this global prison\nWhere we take orders from these fuckin' old tradition senior citizens\nThat are four times older than him\nSo the main point, you ain't never been through nothing like this\nAnd go back to what we were saying on our parents\nAlright? This is what it means to be a Lebanese-American\nIt's the journey it's where we came from and where our parents been\nSo since you think you gon' talk about my parents I'ma use my own parents to embarrass him\nBack to when we was talkin' about your mom being a librarian\nBut let's go to your dad now\nYou heard my dad's story, oh you ready\nYou heard my pop's story, his struggle was hard\nHe came here and turned an emotional scar and made himself to a star\nAnd I'm following in his footsteps\nWhich proves your pops is always a reflection of who you are\nBut what about your dad?\n\n[Soul Khan] He was a piece of shit\n\n[Dizaster]\nWell he was a lawyer, and that could be respected\nBut then what happened? He lost his bar\nAnd became an unemployed fucking loser taking business calls from his car\nWait a minute, that's not all\nHe was a musician like you, he wanted to top the charts\nHe thought it'd go far\nHibbity har har har\nAnd just like you, I doubt you'll make a career out of this ever\nSince you're admitting he's a shitty role model, then let me spend the rest of this to teach you how to do better\nYour pops at 19 got a deal with Capitol Records\nCompared to what happened to my dad at 19 that's substantially better\nLike way better\nBut then what happened?\nHe got dropped before he could put out any records\nAnd he was being managed by Phil Spector!\nLike- that's The Beatles manager, like how fuckin' bad can you be\nLike this is where your fuckin' personalities connect accurately\nBecause you both went to New York to become the man you could be\nI guess it's true what they say, the Big Apple doesn't fall far from the family tree\nAw man, everything about you is what makes you such a lame ass loser\nI'm too advanced\nThis like a cave man with his tools to a space man with a computer\nA space man with a computer-\nWait a minute\nFuck it, you wanna know what the fuckin' joke was about?\nSo who guessed the riddle I was putting out?\nLucy, a drug dealer with a hangover\nCoco, you plus me equals...human\nCousins, Caesar\nWhat are these names of?\nEvolution, primates\nSo to clear up the confusion\nThis about to be rebuttaled to everything he just said about the evolution\nNow, first of all, on the evolutionary chart\nOur most common oldest ancestor on Earth would be Lucy\nNow Lucy, is our oldest ancestor\nTechnically, like a human fused with an animal\nBy battle rap standards, that would be the beginning for us; Juice vs. Supernatural\nNow most of our class, evolved from that\nThose are the ancestors that both connect us\nAnd then there's you on the evolutionary chart\nOutta nowhere with the gay jokes\nYou would be...you would be homoerectus\nNow the anatomy of homoerectus...anatomy wise they were flat and small\nThey were loud, they had tiny hands, they were small\nThey had no balls and that was all\nThey thrived during the GrindTime Era, pay attention\nThis is gonna get crazy\nThey thrived during the GrindTime Era\nAlong with the emergence of a new group of hominids\nThose were called the Neanderthals\nThe GrindTime white guys\nPredominantly white, they felt like they had it all\nThey came into the game as giants which allowed them to stand up tall\nBut eventually their lack of culture will allow them to succumb to a massive fall\nWhich predicated the rise of the Cro Magnon man\nWe're movin' along the chart\nThe Cro Magnon man, in our standards that would be the URL rapper, the Chrome Magnum Man\nNow ironically enough, this the first man to use the tools\nAnd everything was cool\nBut eventually they couldn't come up with anything new\nAnd they hit the ceiling limit of their genetic pool\nThen comes the final transformation into today's modern homosapiens\nMe\nLux, Mook, Pat, Illmac, The Saurus, ICE, Goodz, Shine\nPeople that been here for generations\nAnd most of them branched way out through these changes\nIncluding me, I went through every single one of these evolutionary changes\nHold wait, that's why I got it down to a mathematic perfection\nCause now I'm giving you a timeline which is an accurate projection of where we had this connection\nAnd where we last left off at the last intersection\nCause you had no battles left, so it threw a monkey wrench in what was then your rapid progression\nWhich then lead you to get wiped out by natural selection\nDo I know about evolution? Maybe\nNow, this is where you learn something new here\nCause evolution ain't the only thing that I can do\nWe almost done, I need you to focus with me we're waaay past half way here, we're almost at the end\nWe at the end, we way past half way here\nI'm gonna need some crowd participation, are you guys awake here?\n{Crowd cheers}\nAlright, pull out your phones right now\nAnd trust me, I got all day, I could stay here\nGoogle \"Infinite Monkey\"\nTell me what that say here\n\n[Guy in the crowd]\n\"A monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for infinite about of time will surely complete works of William Shakespeare\n\n[Dizaster]\nWilliam Shakespeare\nOoh, that's another picture I put out, the sixth clue\nThey say if a infinite amount of monkeys type on an infinite amount of typewriters in an infinite amount of universes\nThey should be able to replicate the work of Shakespeare\nBut later on this theory would disprove itself\nAnd actually say that, for that to be possible the probability of it is the closest number to zero\nAnd this is why me and  you will never be equal\nThis is what separates us from monkeys as people\nBecause you see, even if you took a million, trillion infinite Soul Khans in a trillion trillion universes\nYou will never be able to truly replicate the truest purpose of this human's verses\nAnd that's why I made this\nTo let you know that you
