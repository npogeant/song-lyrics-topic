"a tragic dawn lyricsas his cab turned by the end of the pont royal towards the gare d'orsay, m. etienne rambert looked at his watch and found, as he had anticipated, that he had a good quarter of an hour before the train that he intended to take was due to start. he called a porter, and gave him the heavy valise and the bundle of rugs that formed the whole of his hand baggage.  ""where is the office for forwarding luggage, my man?"" he enquired.  the porter led him through the famous panelled hall of the gare d'orsay, and m. etienne rambert satisfied himself that his trunks had been properly registered for verrières, the station at which he had to alight for the château of beaulieu.  still attended by the porter, who had conceived a respectful admiration for him in consequence of the authoritative tone in which he demanded information from the various railway servants, and who scented a probable munificent tip, m. etienne rambert proceeded to the booking-office and took a first-class ticket. he spent a few minutes more at the book-stall where he selected an imposing collection of illustrated papers, and then, his final preparations completed, he turned once more to the porter.  ""the luchon train,"" he said; ""where is it?"" and as the man only made a vague gesture and growled something wholly indistinct, he added: ""lead the way, and i will follow.""  it was now just half-past eight, and the station showed all the animation inseparable from the departure of main-line trains. m. etienne rambert hurried onwards, and reaching the platform from which all the lines begin, was stayed by the porter who was laden with his baggage. ""you want the express, sir?""  ""no, the slow train, my man.""  the porter showed some surprise, but made no remark.  ""do you like the front or the back of the train?""  ""the back by choice.""  ""first-class, isn't it?""  ""yes, first-class.""  the porter, who had stopped a moment, picked up the heavy valise again.  ""then there isn't any choice. there are only two first-class carriages on the slow train, and they are both in the middle.""  ""they are corridor carriages, i suppose?"" said etienne rambert.  ""yes, sir; there are hardly any others on the main-line trains, especially first-class.""  in the ever-increasing crowd etienne rambert had some difficulty in following the porter. the gare d'orsay has little or none of the attractiveness of the other stations, which cannot fail to have a certain fascination for any imaginative person, who thinks of the mystery attaching to all those iron rails reaching out into the distance of countries unknown to him. it is less noisy than the others also, for between austerlitz and orsay the traction is entirely electric. and further, there is no clearly defined separation between the main and the suburban lines.  on the right of the platform was the train which was to take etienne rambert beyond brives to verrières, the slow train to luchon; and on the left of the same platform was another train for juvisy and all the small stations in the suburbs of paris. very few people were making for the train to luchon; but a large crowd was pressing into the suburban train.  the porter who was piloting m. etienne rambert, set the baggage he was carrying down on the footboard of a first-class carriage.  ""there is no one for the slow train yet, sir; if you like to get in first you can choose your own compartment.""  m. etienne rambert acted on the suggestion, but he had hardly set foot in the corridor before the guard, also scenting a generous tip, came to offer his services.  ""it really is the 8.50 you want, sir?"" was his first enquiry. ""you are sure you are not making a mistake?""  ""no,"" etienne rambert replied. ""why?""  ""a great many first-class passengers do make a mistake,"" the man explained, ""and confuse the 8.50 with the 8.45 express.""  as he spoke the guard took the baggage from the porter who had remained on the platform, and the porter, after being generously remunerated for his trouble by m. rambert, hurried away to look for other travellers.  ""the 8.45 is the express, isn't it?"" m. rambert enquired.  ""yes,"" the guard answered; ""it runs right through without stopping at all the small stations as this train does. it goes in front of this one and gets to luchon three hours earlier. there it is on the side there,"" and he pointed through the window in the door on the far side to another train on the next rails, in which a number of travellers were already taking their seats. ""if you prefer to go by that one, sir,"" he went on, ""there is still time for you to change; you are entitled to take your choice since you have a first-class ticket.""  but etienne rambert, after a moment's consideration, declined the suggestion.  ""no: i would rather go by the slow train. if i take the express i should have to get out at brives, and then i should be twelve or thirteen miles from saint-jaury, which is my destination; whereas the slow train stops at verrières, where, by the way, i have already telegraphed to say i shall arrive to-morrow morning.""  he walked a little way along the corridor, assuring himself that the various compartments were still quite empty, and then turned to the guard. ""look here, my man,"" he said, ""i am awfully tired, and i mean to get some sleep to-night; consequently i should like to be alone. now where shall i be most quiet and undisturbed?""  the man understood. m. etienne rambert's enquiry about the place where he would be most quiet, was an implicit promise of a handsome tip if nobody did disturb him.  ""if you like to settle yourself here, sir,"" the man answered, ""you can draw down the blinds at once, and i dare say i shall be able to find room for any other passengers somewhere else.""  ""good,"" said m. rambert, moving towards the compartment indicated. ""i will smoke a cigar until the train starts, and immediately afterwards i will settle down to sleep. by the way, my man, since you seem so obliging, i wish you would undertake to call me to-morrow morning in time for me to get out at verrières. i am desperately sleepy and i am quite capable of not waking up.""  the guard touched his cap.  ""you can be perfectly easy, sir, and sleep without the least anxiety. i won't fail.""  ""very well.""  when his baggage had been stowed away, and his rugs spread out to make the seat more comfortable still, m. etienne rambert repeated his appeal, for he was an old traveller and knew that it does not do to rely too much upon the promises of chance attendants.  ""i can rely upon you, can't i? i may sleep as sound as i like, and you will wake me at verrières?"" and the more to assure himself that the guard would execute his orders he slipped a franc into his hand.  when he was left alone, m. rambert continued his preparations for the night. he carefully drew down the blinds over the door and over the windows of the compartment that gave on to the corridor, and also lowered the shade over the electric light, and then, in order to enjoy the last puffs at his cigar in peace, he opened the window over the other door and leant his elbows on it, watching the final preparations being made by the travellers by the express on the other line.  the departure of a train is always a picturesque sight, and m. rambert leant forward inquisitively to note how the passengers had installed themselves in the two compartments which he could see from his coign of vantage.  there were not many people in the train. as a matter of fact the brives and luchon line is not much used at this time of year. if the number of passengers in the express were any criterion etienne rambert might reasonably expect that he would be the only one in the slow train. but there was not much time for observations and reflections of this kind. on the platform for the express, which he got a glimpse of through the compartments, people were hurrying up their farewells. the passengers had got into their carriages, and the friends who had come to see them off were standing alone upon the platform. there was the sound of safety locks being fastened by porters, and the noise of trollies being wheeled along bearing articles for sale.  ""pillows! rugs! sweets! papers!""  then came the whistle of the guard, the shriller scream from the electric engine, and then, slowly at first but steadily, more rapidly as the engine got up speed, the express moved along the platform and plunged into the tunnel on the way to austerlitz.  meanwhile the guard of the slow train was doing wonders. shamelessly resolved to assure perfect quiet to ""his"" passenger, he managed, without unduly compromising himself but yet without leaving any doubt about it in any mind, to insinuate discreetly that m. rambert's carriage was reserved, so that that gentleman might count upon an entirely undisturbed night.  a few minutes after the express had gone, the slow train drew out in its turn, and disappeared into the darkness of the underground tunnel.  at the château of beaulieu young charles rambert was just finishing dressing when a gentle tap sounded on the door of his room.  ""it is a quarter to five, charles. get up at once!""  ""i am awake already, thérèse,"" charles rambert answered with some pride. ""i shall be ready in two minutes.""  ""what? up already?"" the girl exclaimed from the other side of the door. ""marvelous! i congratulate you. i'm ready too; i will wait for you in the dining-room. come down as soon as you are dressed.""  ""all right!"" the young man answered.  he wasted no time over his toilette, the more so because it was none too warm in his room, for at this early hour it was still quite dark; and then taking his light in one hand he opened his door carefully so as to make no noise, tip-toed along the landing, and went down the staircase to join thérèse in the dining-room. the girl was an accomplished housekeeper already, and while waiting for the young fellow she had got a scratch meal together.  ""let us have breakfast quickly,"" she suggested; ""it isn't snowing this morning, and if you like we might walk to the station. we have plenty of time, and it will do us good to have a walk.""  ""it will warm us up anyhow,"" charles rambert replied; he was only half-awake, but he sat beside thérèse, and did justice to the preparations she had made.  ""do you know that it is very wonderful of you to get up so punctually?"" mme. de langrune's granddaughter remarked. ""how did you manage it? last night you were afraid you would sleep on as usual.""  ""it was not much trouble for me to wake up,"" charles rambert answered. ""i hardly closed an eye all night.""  ""but i promised to come and knock at your door myself, so you might have slept without any anxiety.""  ""that's so, but to tell you the truth, thérèse, i was regularly upset and excited by the thought of papa arriving this morning.""  they had both finished breakfast, and thérèse got up.  ""shall we start?"" she asked.  ""yes.""  thérèse opened the hall door, and the two young people went down the flight of steps leading to the garden. the girl had thrown a big cloak over her shoulders, and she inhaled the pure morning air with keen delight.  ""i love going out in the early morning,"" she declared.  ""well, i don't like it at all,"" charles rambert confessed with characteristic candour. ""good lord, how cold it is! and it is still pitch dark!""  ""surely you are not going to be frightened?"" said thérèse teasingly.  charles rambert made an irritable movement of vexation and surprise.  ""frightened? what do you take me for, thérèse? if i don't like going out in the early morning it's really only because it is cold.""  she laughed at him while they were crossing the lawn towards the out-buildings, through which she meant to get out on to the high road. as they passed the stables they came across a groom who was leisurely getting an old brougham out of the coach-house.  ""don't hurry, jean,"" thérèse called out as she greeted him. ""we are going to walk to the station, and the only important thing is that you should be there to bring us back.""  the man touched his cap and the two young people passed through the park gate and found themselves upon the high road.  it was still very dark, with just a wan reflection in the distance of the sky vaguely outlining some cloud-shapes to the eastward to give some promise of the day. there was no sound to break the silence of the fields, and as they walked briskly along charles and thérèse could hear their footsteps ringing on the hard surface of the frozen ground.  ""it must please you awfully to be going to meet your father,"" said mme. de langrune's granddaughter half questioningly. ""it is a long time since you have seen him, isn't it?""  ""three years,"" charles rambert answered, ""and then just for a few minutes. he is coming home from america now, and before that he travelled in spain for a long time.""  ""he was travelling the whole time you were a child, wasn't he?""  ""yes, always: either in colombia, looking after his rubber plantations there, or in spain, where he has a good deal of property too. when he was in paris he used to come to the school and ask for me, and i saw him in the parlour—for a quarter of an hour.""  ""and your mother?""  ""oh, mamma was different. you know, thérèse, i spent all  the childhood that i can remember at the school. i liked the masters and had good chums, and was very happy there, and if the truth must be told i looked forward with anything but pleasure to the holidays, when i had to go to my parents' house. i always felt a stranger with them; my real home was the school-room, where i had my desk and all my own interests. and then, you know, when one is little one doesn't understand things much; i didn't feel having hardly any family, very much.""  ""but you loved your mother very much?""  thérèse asked the question quite anxiously, and it was patent that she would have thought it dreadful if her companion had not had a real affection for his mother.  ""oh, yes, i loved her,"" charles rambert answered; ""but i hardly knew her either."" and as thérèse showed her surprise he went on, telling her something of the secret of his lonely childhood. ""you see, thérèse, now that i am a man i guess lots of things that i could not have had even a suspicion of then. my father and mother did not get on well together. they were what you call an ill-assorted couple. they were both very good, but their characters did not harmonise. when i was little i always saw mamma silent and sad, and papa active and on the go, and bright and talking at the top of his voice. i half believe he frightened mamma! and then my father was constantly away, whereas mamma hardly ever went out. when a servant took me to the house on thursdays, i was taken up to say good morning to her, and i invariably found her lying on a sofa in her room, with the blinds down and almost dark. she just touched me with her lips and asked me one or two questions, and then i was taken away again because i tired her.""  ""was she ill, then?""  ""mamma always has been ill. i suppose you know, thérèse, that three months ago—stay, it was just when i had taken my degree and went to germany—she was sent to an asylum? i believe my father had wanted her to agree to undergo careful treatment of the kind long before, but she would not.""  thérèse was silent for a few minutes.  ""you have not been very happy,"" she said presently.  ""oh, it was only after i grew up that i felt unhappy. when i was a little chap i never thought of how sad it is to have no real father or mother. the last four or five years it has hurt me, but when he came to see me once at school, papa told me he would take me with him as soon as i had taken my degree and grown up. last october, after my examination, he wrote and told me to be patient a little longer, and that he was hurrying on with the winding up of his business and coming back to france. that gave me a hope which has brightened these last few months, and will also make you understand why i am so pleased this morning at my fathers coming. it seems to me that a new life is going to begin.""  day was breaking now: a dirty december day, with the light filtering through heavy grey clouds that drifted along the ground, hid the horizon, clung to the low hills, and then suddenly dispersed in long wisps driven by a keen breeze, that got up in gusts, and drove clouds of dust along the hard frozen ground.  ""i have not been very happy either,"" said thérèse, ""for i lost my father when i was tiny: i don't even remember him; and mamma must be dead as well.""  the ambiguous turning of the child's phrase caught charles rambert's interested attention.  ""what does that mean, thérèse? don't you know if your mother is dead?""  ""yes, oh yes; grandmamma says so. but whenever i ask for particulars grandmamma always changes the subject. i will echo what you said just now: when you are little you don't know anything and are not surprised at anything. for a long time i took no notice of her sudden reticence, but now i sometimes wonder if something is not being kept back from me—whether it is really true that mamma is no more in this world.""  talking like this thérèse and charles had walked at a good pace, and now they came to the few houses built around verrières station. one by one, bedroom windows and doors were being opened; peasants were making their way to the sheds to lead their cattle to the pastures.  ""we are very early,"" thérèse remarked, pointing to the station clock in the distance. ""your father's train is due at 6.55, and it is only 6.40 now; we still have a quarter of an hour to wait, and more, if the train is not punctual!""  they went into the little station and charles rambert, thankful for some shelter from the cold, stamped his feet, making a sudden uproar in the empty waiting-room. a porter appeared.  ""who the deuce is kicking up all this row?"" he began angrily, and then seeing thérèse, broke off short. ""ah, mademoiselle thérèse,"" he said with the familiar yet perfectly respectful cordiality that marks country folk, ""up already? have you come to meet somebody, or are you going away?""  as he spoke, the porter turned a curious eye upon charles rambert, whose arrival had caused quite a sensation two days before in this little spot, where with but few exceptions none but people belonging to the neighbourhood ever came by train.  ""no, i am not going away,"" thérèse replied. ""i have accompanied m. rambert, who has come to meet his father.""  ""ah-ha, to meet your papa, sir: is he coming from far?""  ""from paris,"" charles rambert answered. ""is the train signalled yet?""  the man drew out a watch like a turnip, and looked at the time.  ""it won't be here for quite another twenty minutes. the work on the tunnel makes it necessary to be careful, and it's always late now. but you will hear when the bell rings: that will be when the train is coming over the level-crossing; it will run into the station three minutes after that. well, mademoiselle, i must get on with my work,"" and the man left them.  thérèse turned to charles rambert.  ""shall we go on to the platform? then we shall see the train come in.""  so they left the waiting-room and began to walk up and down the whole length of the platform. thérèse watched the jerky movements of the hands of the clock, and smiled at her companion.  ""five minutes more, and your father will be here! four minutes more! ah! there it is!"" and she pointed to a slope in the distance where a slight trail of smoke rose white against the blue of the sky, now clear of cloud. ""can't you see it? that is the steam from the engine coming out of the tunnel.""  ere she finished speaking the quivering whir of the bell echoed through the empty station.  ""ah!"" said charles rambert: ""at last!""  the two porters who, with the stationmaster, constituted the entire railway staff at verrières, came bustling along the platform, and while the bell continued its monotonous whirring ring, pulled forward trucks in readiness for any possible luggage. puffing portentously, the engine slackened speed, and the heavy train slowed down and finally stopped, bringing a noisy atmosphere of life into the station of verrières that but a moment ago was so still.  the first-class carriages had stopped immediately in front of charles and thérèse, and on the footboard etienne rambert stood, a tall, elderly man of distinguished appearance, proud bearing and energetic attitude, with extraordinarily keen eyes and an unusually high and intelligent forehead. seeing thérèse and charles he seized his baggage and in a twinkling had sprung on to the platform. he dropped his valise, tossed his bundle of rugs on to a seat, and gripped charles by the two shoulders.  ""my boy!"" he exclaimed; ""my dear boy!""  although he had hitherto shown so little affection for his child, it was obvious that the man was making a great effort to restrain his emotion, and was really moved when he now saw him again as a grown young man.  nor, on his part, did charles rambert remain unmoved. as if the sudden grip of this almost stranger, who yet was his father, had awakened a world of memories within him, he turned very pale and his voice faltered as he replied:  ""papa! dear papa! i am so glad to see you!""  thérèse had drawn tactfully aside. m. rambert still held his son by the shoulders and stepped back a pace, the better to consider him.  ""why, you are a man! how you have altered, my boy! you are just what i hoped you would be: tall and strong! ah, you are my son all right! and you are quite well, hey? yet you look tired.""  ""i did not sleep well,"" charles explained with a smile. ""i was afraid i should not wake up.""  turning his head, m. rambert saw thérèse and held out his hand.  ""how do you do, my little thérèse?"" he exclaimed. ""you have altered too since i saw you last. i left a little chit of a child, and now i behold a grown-up young lady. well! i must be off at once to pay my respects to my dear old friend, your grandmother. all well at the château, eh?""  thérèse shook hands warmly with m. rambert and thanked him prettily.  ""grandmamma is very well; she told me to tell you to excuse her if she did not come to meet you, but her doctor says she must not get up very early.""  ""of course your grandmamma is excused, my dear. besides, i have to thank her for her kindness to charles, and for the hospitality she is going to extend to me for a few days.""  meanwhile the train had gone on again, and now a porter came up to m. rambert.  ""will you take your luggage with you, sir?""  recalled to material things, etienne rambert contemplated his trunk which the porters had taken out of the luggage van.  ""good lord!"" he began, but thérèse interrupted him.  ""grandmamma said she would send for your heavy luggage during the morning, and that you could take your valise and any small parcels with us in the brougham.""  ""what's that? your grandmamma has taken the trouble to send her carriage?""  ""it's a long way to beaulieu, you know,"" thérèse replied. ""ask charles if it isn't. we came on foot and the walk would be too tiring for you after a whole night in the train.""  the three had reached the station yard, and thérèse stopped in surprise.  ""why, how's that?"" she exclaimed; ""the carriage is not here.  and yet jean was beginning to get it ready when we left the château.""  m. etienne rambert was resting one hand on his son's shoulder, and contemplating him with an affectionate, all-embracing survey every now and then. he smiled at thérèse.  ""he may have been delayed, dear. i tell you what we will do. since your grandmamma is going to send for my luggage there is no need for me to take my valise; we can leave everything in the cloak-room and start for the château on foot; if my memory serves me right—and it is a very good memory—there is only one road, so we shall meet jean and can get into the carriage on the way.""  a few minutes later all three set out on the road to beaulieu. m. rambert walked between the two young people; he had gallantly offered his arm to thérèse, who was not a little proud of the attention, which proved to her mind that she was now regarded as a grown-up young lady. on the other side of his father charles made answer to the incessant questions put to him.  m. etienne rambert enjoyed the walk in the quiet morning through the peaceful country-side. with a tender half-melancholy he recognised every turn in the road, every bit of scenery.  ""just fancy my coming back here at sixty years of age, with a great son of eighteen!"" he said with a laugh. ""and i remember as if it were yesterday the good times i have had at the château of beaulieu. mme. de langrune and i will have plenty of memories to talk over. gad! it must be quite forty years since i came this way, and yet i remember every bit of it. say, thérèse, isn't it the fact that we shall see the front of the château directly we have passed this little copse?""  ""quite true,"" the girl answered with a laugh. ""you know the country very well, sir.""  ""yes,"" said etienne rambert; ""when one gets to my age, little thérèse, one always does remember the happy days of one's youth; one remembers recent events much less distinctly. most likely that means, my dear, that the human heart declines to grow old and refuses to preserve any but pictures of childhood.""  for a few minutes m. rambert remained silent, as if absorbed in somewhat melancholy reflections. but he soon recovered himself and shook off the tender sadness evoked in his mind by memories of the past.  ""why, the park enclosure has been altered,"" he exclaimed. ""here is a wall which used not to be here: there was only a hedge.""  thérèse laughed.  ""i never knew the hedge,"" she said. ""i have always seen the wall.""  ""must we go on to the main gate?"" m. rambert asked, ""or has your grandmamma had another gate made?""  ""we are going in by the out-buildings,"" the girl answered; ""then we shall hear why jean did not come to meet us."" she opened a little door half-hidden among the moss and ivy that clothed the wall surrounding the park, and making m. rambert and charles pass in before her, cried: ""but jean has gone with the brougham, for the horses are not in the stable. how was it we did not meet him?"" then she laughed. ""poor jean! he is so muddle-headed! i would not mind betting he went to meet us at saint-jaury, as he does every morning to bring me home from church.""  the little company, etienne rambert, thérèse and charles, were now approaching the château. passing beneath mme. de langrune's windows thérèse called merrily up to them.  ""here we are, grandmamma!""  there was no reply.  but at the window of an adjoining room appeared the figure of the steward, dollon, making a gesture, as if asking for silence.  thérèse, in advance of her guests, had proceeded but a few yards when mme. de langrune's old servant rushed down the stone flight of steps in front of the château, towards m. rambert.  dollon seemed distraught. usually so respectful and so deferential in manner, he now seized m. rambert by the arm, and imperiously waving thérèse and charles away, drew him aside.  ""it is awful, sir,"" he exclaimed: ""horrible: a fearful thing has happened. we have just found mme. la marquise dead—murdered—in her room!""embed"

it's like that, but less funny and then you get a check you can spend it on your food and ya rent fuck, i'm doing it again so diz', rent... i'll take it slow see rent is this thing where you know find a place, and you pay money to stay monthly see, i ain't know if you're aware of it, because you ain't left your parents till your fuckin' late 20s so according to you, right, on twitter you called me a ""manchild"" the audacity! that you, mister level headed adult you called me a ""manchild"" that is damn wild you were living with your mom and dad while i was in my own crib, diggin' up dirt on qp for that damn file back to that iron battle, you know i gotta say the angle about jews not going to work on 9/11, kinda clever except you didn't go to work on 9-- ever see down the line i went through shit my crew split as too did my creative drive, my will to stay alive took a huge dip and my momma got too sick down to a toothpick and i stopped makin' music see the sad thing is diz, you said i tried and i flopped nah, it was going fine, then i stopped it was painful, truly see, i know it sounds sad, but soul is still a joker though i ain't talking about the gotham kind talking like persona 5 that is what i was personified cause i lost track of all the kind of monsters i had caught inside especially the one whisperin' to me that i oughta die so bottom line, there is nothing you can say to me that is more evil than the shit i used to tell myself all the time i got out that coma i been frozen lately i gotta thanks all the homies that could motivate me even though the road was shaky like the way dizaster's parents thought it was okay to hold a baby so now y'all here to see my return to the format you here to be my personal doormat hold up before we go all that do battle rappers still say dumb shit like ""you catch a shell, then you sleep like squirtle and snorlax""?

might be a reason to pretend that it is we both know a secret you oughta know let me take you back i recently remembered when you and i were at club excess in a pit like this doin' shit like this and diz was saying, this and that, i wasn't listening you know what diz is like? it's a thing thing, the moment that burned in my memory is when he turned and he said to me yo bro, it's funny, i ain't exactly muslim shit and i was like, what? good lord! diz, are you telling us? that through your entire battling career, and you've been battling for years, a third of your life, earning your stripes you led us to believe that you're muslim, and this whole motherfucking time you never actually said one you not exactly, i never was gonna say that see he says, i never said i was a muslim but you say it in the battles, not the interviews but every time the interviewer calls you muslim, you never correct or interrupt him that's disgusting don't play, i ain't a bit amused cause--   i'm an offshoot of islam, that's why    nhhh, yeah that's debatable but relatable so well no i'm talking in your relation on what you do you misrepresent yourself to your fans and to your opponents i want them to take themselves back to the moments and the raps that you told em using cultural standings that ain't actually holding are you of the mind that just because racist thinks all arabs are in terror groups that that makes it fair for you to uphold the stereotypes of terror too? what about muslims who aren't arab, dude? you don't know think south asians and african muslims get hassled at customs? or that their women in hijabs and burkas are afraid of getting shot and murdered due to the rise in fucking islamic, anti-islamic fervor? so he has a rebuttal i'm sure that shit is subtle you know a lot of the old jewish lines i had were fucking foolish but the difference between that and you is i'm actually fucking jewish like, this here, was his decision and now we in this position you hate the cultures vultures, what are you, a religion pigeon? i mean obviously you're arab, so you know the language and the basic protocol but you faking overall i guess dizaster is just arabic for rachel dolezal either way, you lied so these people have no reason to even slightly believe you or i have just freed you to finally be you diz, do you hear this do you recognize the scheme see where i'm trying to lead you it's soul khan, from the last tribe of the hebrews listen diz, you can admit it honestly, you don't wanna do it out loud and that's just too much to ask though that's fine if you're not muslim, just stand here, looking like the world's stupidest asshole oh damnit, i'm so proud of you that probably took a lot of you right? honestly i don't wanna do anything more on this verse but if this contest of a honor, pride and our worth it's just a motherfucking homicide in the first but, if that ain't enough you just get to serve me i don't give a fuck cause in 2021, your president is bernie (diz: you done?) i could be, hold on i like you just wobbling back and forth (diz: c'mon pull something out, c'mon rebuttal something) no, i don't want to right now just looking at you like, sorta like, wobbling, yeah go diz, it's your turn    oh it's my turn? y'all ready for some shit?! what the fuck was that? what the fuck was that? ay trust me, we gon get to the muslim in round 3, but right now woo! we gotta address fucking mc dry milk this ain't a battle, this a race to see which one of us gon' be the first to get this guy killed me, or his white guilt fucking soul khan i'm not the person to step to yeah, we gon' start off with this because honestly, i'm not here to psychologically test you i'm here to open up a door, for everybody to get through just like a west hollywood rest room if i get mad today, i'mma just say ""f you"" instead of wishing death on you, i'ma just wish i never met you he wants to gender stuff, we can all be men, women too, c'mon even though y'all don't believe it, a lot of y'all like to pretend to just like your mom did to fulfill the role of your pops when he left you left you, without a dope beat to step to step one: this a battle, i ain't gotta respect you step two: you only here cause the rent's due your bitch left you and the music not bringing the checks through step three: he couldn't make a return unless he went against me the leader of the lgbt going against a wmd he's a proud sjw he's g-l-a-d to be the ceo of a bunch of new groups a-b-c-d-e-f-g's the h-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p's the q-r-s, the t-u-v's, and don't you forget those x-y-z's are you fucking kidding me? you said you quit battle rap, what you back here using us for? you said you wouldn't return till you had a grammy you think we forgot the stupid shit you used to say and do from before you said you was done with this game, you gon make go music and hit the booth and record i guess it's safe to say he's back with the canadians since america couldn't give this jew no award (juno award) hold on, hold on how long you gonna fucking hold on for?

lot of people think you gon get 3-0'd i mean that'd be pretty sweet yo i mean, cause this shit is something you need for your ego me though? i be known for some other shit that you think that we share, but when you compare, we don't so, who here knows the song 'fahrenheit'? see cause people can sing along with that telling me you never feel like you wanted that honestly diz', you was showing your rectum if you say you have as close a connection as i do fans across the entire emotional spectrum i mean you have laughter, and over-aggression i'm there for them when they lonely and desperate or when they're hopeless, hopeful, or breathless when someone shows them affection i'm there for them whatever they're living through whether they're training or in their living room that's a sense of fulfillment i wish i could give to you but i can't but dammit i fucking pity you i'm not in a battle gonna try to outrap or outflow you but on a track i will roast you because you adapt when the pro tools are tracking your vocals or at least that's what's born out of by some other examples we'll go through so, namely you gave your mom a beautiful mother's day freestyle right? it was gorgeous it was written down that does not make this better what i'm about to say my friend, you gave your mom a freestyle for mother's day there had to be another way i'm talking flowers and cards instead of powerful bars! if i was your mom i had wish you were a runaway and honestly when i started watching it get really intense body language gotta be anxious gotta inching forward like he was gonna pull the straps on her look like you were about to math hoffa ya damn momma now, for the record if i you wanna watch this, i made a shortcut tinyurl.com/dizmom alright? please join with me if you watching at home or later on youtube because i love my mother too and i've got time my friend, we gonna go through all this shit line by line actual quote diz said to his mom ""you're my sword when i'm swordless"" why in god's name did you record this? hold on though! if you're swordless, then your hand or wherever you sheathe it by definition is not where your sword is bear with me if i gotta i break it down, you understand just switch the metaphor with the shit's that's intended for you're saying you're my mom and when i'm momless which, my mom would be appalled if she thought i thought that she wanted such incompetent dog shits the next line is you're my spiritual fountain spiritual fountain! i wanna hear all about them my friend is a spiritual fountain more like a lyrical fountain or a miracle fountain spiritual fountain the last line of this, blew my mind with this you're my breath when i'm drowning now when you drown, you lose air so based on the sequence of the line and the meaning that's implied she is not keeping you alive, she is leaving you to die but honestly, she seems really kind, no disrespect intended to your mom especially, cause all the shit diz has said, and done it's amazing diz isn't done so can we clap it up for dizaster's mom now, the next example is a song that's actually your best if that were case for me, i would be massively impressed it's called 'don't play me' produced by chase moore that means the best aspect of a track ain't yours literally said, i'mma say this real slow for everyone to see this was written down too, right? it is? oh c'mon ""i'll strike you with a midas touch and grab your wife and fuck till the hymen bust open like a fire hydrant wide and fire trucks driving sideways on the highways till i fuck my tires up"" i guess in that fires are chaotic and fuck everything up but like, now, because i am a masochist and i've got time we gon' tackle this line by line hold on by the way, tinyurl.com/dontplaydiz oh i forgot, hold on wait a second, you know what rhymes with tinyurl.com/dizmom diz lied about his bond with islam okay, so look back to this this magnum opus so, ""i'll strike you with a midas touch and grab your wife and fuck"" so the touch of midas turn whatever you hold into genuine gold like it's treasure in a vault so what you saying is if someone gave you this incredible ability you would use it to commit sexual assault you are a great ambassador for this culture by the way let's go to this, ""till the hymen bust open like a fire hydrant wide and fire trucks"" jesus christ i guess you're not aware that hymens don't bust, actually kinda tear even then it's a misconception that's kinda rare diz, do you know what a hymen looks like hold on, do you know what a vagina looks like i see the gears turning i hear them ears burning he wants to rebuttal me like, ""of course i've seen a vagina, it's standing right in front of me auhh i'm in oakland now i'm standing over here in oakland"" next line this the wild shit ""like a fire hydrant wide and fire trucks driving sideways on the highways till i fuck my tires up"" are you the fire truck? like a transformer? are you stunt driving like the transporter are you like some fireman deplorably ignoring his last order i don't get it diz, the problem is also here is that the wife would also end up gold right? story there, somewhat i can't tell if you're trying to cuckold or fuck gold and i don't know if this is a minus or plus but if she's making of gold, the hymen won't bust and you know, gold,  , that's strong material you know what's not strong material? ya song material and that's ya best song, goddammit, it's frustrating i want to set up a rap camp and we'll see you this summer ness can teach you flow mac can teach you structure maybe i don't know, i don't know people are new, geechi gotti would be an instructor to help you not sound like such a geeky motherfucker but i don't sound that weird diz, those beautiful braids when i said you oughta to explore your artistry more i didn't mean you should cosplay as the guitarist from korn this is you every time you perform ""to me, you're nothing but a future corpse if this fragile little jewish dork even imagines using force i will luchadore slam his little form and use him as a tuning fork no one gives a fuck about the stupid music you perform i will build you a casket, fill it with padding just for keeping the acoustics warm i'm hotter than the human torch which is actually funny, cause if you were born back in the 20s in your grandparents' country, you would be a human torched you are only the goat because all jews were born with a pair of hooves and horns"" you want us to think you're destined to kill a man nah, you look like you stuck between steps in the thriller dance and you still advance if i had to change ya name to encapsulate the raid of trash you aggregate it would be edward fillerhands what was that advice that patrick had told you? relax, let em go loose but yet, every time you use your arms, i'm imagining goku at the supermarket examining produce diz you always down for unlimited rounds like you solid snake here's something you should consider now, consolidate i'm here to marie kondo out your closet space you have always lived in, but never exist in, an islamic state you are getting so fucked up that it could become someone's fetish complete with its own subreddit i hope that one of my old fans came to oakland and grew up to become medics cause this level of blood shedding is upsetting like a pump of unleaded fuck buttin' heads, i am getting ready to behead him khan's flow, a.c. cowlings with the bronco kicking over lawn gnomes you be dropping n bombs and you ain't got the launch codes oakland, california, can you hit me with the amen ay man, sicker than a vape pen diz be always whining like an infant in his playpen begging for respect that he's never gonna get, like ricky and his grade 10 for me...nothing you'll ever say is gonna hurt me cause in 2021, son, the president is bernie    wow, thank god y'all ready for rapping again?! now, when soul khan around anyone from the sons, even the lesser ones it's like he can smell it in the air earlier today he met brixx belvedere and he was like, ""hmmm. i feel like i know you from somewhere."" and brixx was like, ""ummm. i don't really-"" he's like, ""yeah. i feel like i do. i feel like i know you from somewhere before."" and brixx was like, ""okay, okay man. i'm not with the sons anymore."" ""ah ha! i caught you. now feel the wrath as the lightening strikes down if conceited don't wanna battle me, fuck it brixx i'll battle your right now!"" bernie, bernie, bernie this fuckin' pacifist, passive aggressive attitude obviously isn't workin' cause bro all you do is judge people and talk about politics and if you think that's okay that's obviously a problem you need to solve first then cause it's probably no worse than somebody who spends all of his time absorbing other people's opinions online to the point they actually forget to be their own person he introduces himself as, ""hi i'm a socialist."" why don't you say, ""i'm noah"" first then, help us help you discover your core version? cause even though you lost as fuck, i don't gotta be up here with you soul searchin' i can't even find you, there's no person you used to be merciless, no mercy, then went cold turkey, no cursin' even ripped up the old verses where he wrote cursive fell flat on his back then returned to the old circuit lookin' so nervous, feelin' more worthless shaking below surface it's unfortunate when you decide to put the word ""soul"" in your name and find out you ain't got a soul or a sole (soul) purpose it's over it's not even at the end of the show and it's closed curtains i'ma put him in a bag and zip him up cause i'm focused now, so if one of these little guys in the crowd try to interrupt i don't give a fuck listen, i came here to rip you up if this is your hero then i must really be a heel cause i'm only a couple inches away from having soul (sole) lifted up you a baby chihuahua bitch boy which means, you bark like you big and tough but you really just a little pup and you ain't ready for the final level of contra bitch, your heart's not big enough yeah, he wants to protest against the guns ""bernie"" but go ahead i don't need one long blade split down the middle but the edge is rough i'll fuckin', i'll fuckin', i'll fuckin' i'll slice under the belly and give him a little nip and tuck i'll create a new move called ""the sitting duck"" i'll vertically swing it up and knock the lash off his eyeball before he can even blink it once you think i give a fuck? you think i give a fuck if the crew's filming us? yeah, put this on film and just rearrange your facial features on camera and twist ya little pixels up i'll completely ruin your definition and get to slicing and get to edit stuff and finish up with {slicing sound} i call that, ""the director's cut"" and guess what (what?) it still isn't enough! i gotta send it back to the blacksmith so he can sharpen the ridges and add the finishing touch bing now it's welded smooth and it's extra new i call it, ""the confession booth"" cause it'll make you spill your guts you fuckin' little bitch i.e.d. in the building underneath your feet i'll blow this whole building up you wouldn't survive the blast if you rolled up here with the same armor on as gizmoduck bitch, all you got is the 1/2, 1/2 simple punch recycled puns, played out ones same typical order cliché fat joke cliché race joke and he doesn't even think of the jokes, he's an internet quoter this is literally the billy crystal of windows explorer but you're more of a nerd with a mental disorder which makes you joaquin phoenix cause you not even the original joker bitch, you know what you are? ha, he said he makes music, you a shitty performer you a little fuckin' leftist libby little sissy new yorker you a dime a dozen hipster making his songs with his little rhythms on his mini recorder then transfers them into his home studio through his mini controller you think i give a fuck about being a political soldier or a registered voter? you right bitch i'm   from the mountains of the   yeah, and i'ma go out smokin' in the middle of a forest gettin' lit like christopher dorner you talkin' to someone who's really been in a war i have crossed the syrian border versus someone who speaks on our shit like a distant reporter like, ""oh no. those kids got hit by a mortar... well vote for bernie and he'll pass that executive order."" fuck bernie sanders! you a fuckin' hypocrite fresco- actually i like bernie but the point is, you a hypocrite you- this is someone who literally told fresco he was gay cause he was into yoga then nine years later he goes on queenzflip and tells him that he's into yoga i don't know if it's me or him or he's trying to undo every line he's ever said you went from accusing people of being homosexual for slightly wearing their pants tight around their legs to letting a grown man help you put your own legs behind your head yeah man, you're some type of tough rapper all that learning how to do pilates and shit, there can only be one answer he's trying to learn how to become more flexible so the next time he becomes depressed over trump, he can curl up in a ball that much faster ""fuck trump!"" ""fuck dizaster!"" he's an activist for the poor democrat pamphlets on the board so i showed up to his house cause i was curious, what was all this activism for soon as i got to his front steps i was greeted by two buff ass tomboys with their arms crossed standing at the door they said, ""what's the password?"" i said, ""faggot"" one of them raised their hands like this and said, ""you now have access to the floor."" i said, ""thanks, but i'm not going in."" ""well why not?"" i said, ""cause this is kinda, sorta, really not my thing."" ""wait a minute. are you a homophobe?"" ""homoph- nah, i love gay people."" that's when the other one said, ""that's it! i've had enough of your shit man! you need to leave bro."" and that's when i said, ""bro?...you just assumed my gender!"" ""well yeah. you're totally a bro man."" i was like, ""what?! i'm not a woman. i'm not in-between and i'm not a man."" ""well what are you then?"" i said, ""i'm a- a- i identify as a plant! i said a plant!"" ""but bro you can't!"" i said, ""wait a minute. are you a plant-aphobe?"" ""plant-aphobe? aw, aw nah. we're totally not plantaphobes, we love plants."" i said, ""well then you will address me as that do you understand? ""actually. i do understand like, like how you're going through self expression like a vegan going through depression. i totally can dig it man i mean plant! i mean plant! fuck i mean plant. sorry."" that's what it's like dealing with you idiots i mean plant! god fuckin' damn goddamn i forgot the part i gotta freestyle now you not a real jew i didn't have no jew bars until now you don't rock a fedora wait, you not a real jew you rock a fedora you not a real jew you don't follow the torah you got led lightbulbs in your home you don't got no menorah you not from jerusalem, you from eastside sodom and gomorrah and over there you control the set speaking of gomorrah (gamora), i'm marveled at how your personalities both connect when i walk you off close to the ledge and watch you drop onto the rocks over the edge what you don't get it? i'ma have soul stone'd to death bitch, we been on our grizzly while you overslept a fuckin' california bear who's been in the new york zoo for so long he became a domesticated home owner's pet that shit you was cryin' on blogs you was supposed to get? i stayed here and got those enormous checks cause i kept on workin', wakin' up in cold sweats workin' on these words, learnin' how to make more metaphors connect while you got a legacy that's a rolodex of homophobic insults to the most effect you spit shit that your political views don't reflect but you've grown up since you've changed now, you're not a sexist, you quit it like you would let a racist white guy tell you, ""you know what? i'm no longer racist and you gon' let me get away with it."" you a fuckin' hypocrite, contradict yourself in every statement you make you just too fake to admit it cause you're really a closet fuckin' racist and that's why you got so many regrets and the difference between me and you is i had a clean conscious when i said it you understand me? this guy got nothin' but basic linguistics, he's way too simplistic he gave up and quit jeffrey epstein, it's clear he was never able to hang to begin with aw shit, this shit is painful he gon' get a face full of stitches paid in full shit yeah, i'ma get creative with this you think i hate you cause of your race? y'all are the chosen ones, man an old generation that's bathing in riches i'm just mad at you cause you're the only jew that hasn't created a business how scary is this? my race angles are very vicious i can put an end to a conversation with a jew with two words; ""merry christmas""    i fear like there's gotta be an explanation of the actual definition of hypocrisy so, a hypocrite is someone who says one thing and does different shit whereas i changed my entire life so your criticism doesn't apply and here's another thing that you should regard quick i didn't flop like i said, i quit music for a while you're a terribly listener, no wonder your music is garbage you think i'm a bigger geek than you my friend, you're an anime obsessed fucking weeaboo i heard that got married, congratulations do you call her your waifu? like the awkwardest white dude did you propose to her with cherry blossoms and haiku's if it weren't for the fact that she probably wipes you i'd say, she probably feels like she got a 9th grader when she asks you to clean the bathroom, and you're like, ""you mean the hyperbolic time chamber?"" what about the sex? is it hotter when you roleplay as inuyasha and kagome now, do you think diz is ever domestically violent? heck no i'd say he never try it and every time him and his wife get into a fight, she finds a way to let go while you go in your basement and write her name in the death note diz talks about the streets, he isn't from there he's from our neighborhood, where the hot topic is that hot topic was replaced by pacific sunwear and the fact that you share a zip code with   just goes to show you ain't naturally large, you just actually scarred and have low impulse control are you okay man? you're doing okay, you'll get through with it and that's why your parents are afraid you'll share the fate of sharon tate so every black friend of dizaster is a professional actor that his parents paid to scare him straight it's not working i think i have a question they probably bail you out of all sorts of stupid shit that you do so it is, i'mma have to ask you, are you actually cool with? the fact that you supported trump and therefore backed a political movement that doesn't actually consider black people a human? you okay man? you look so upset so i'll say this leupold good snooze, he's falling asleep, falling asleep, okay cool i heard your guns are lethal, popping with them tools correction, all your guns are legal, officer approved 'cause ain't nothing more gangster than following the rules something that i noticed, when you first   around, you didn't spit gun bars a lot when you came into the circuit how was it? crafting them, waiting till they were perfect did you wanna hone them even more, wait till you deserved it i got it now, you ain't spit gun bars cause you were waiting for a permit very responsible of you you always like to say that americans have rights correction, america always has arabs in its sights america has rights, no america has kids in cages terrorized by ice i'm telling you and asking you, man to man go talk about american rights to the tombstone of sandra bland you're a new husband, some day a prospective father talk about american rights to the grandkids and kids of eric garner diz, i agree that in many ways, clinton would've been a evil killer but the communities i work with, are truly getting hurt diz and a lot of it is because that motherfucker stephen miller who is it? oh golly shit man, stephen miller, the opponent by the guy you voted for and i know you changed your mind, but you can't change your time it's kinda weird right now, it fucks me up a little bit i know this ain't your typical wordplay, work day but it's a little disturbing you ain't know who stephen miller is, but you probably know like piccolo's birthday see, i have changed, diz it's proof, you don't agree cause you don't believe in evolution no, like you don't actually believe in evolution like the theory of charles darwin the theory of evolution you don't believe in evolution, it's the reason that we're human but i do remember you have a thing for schrödinger's cat well the man schrödinger that, conceived it and concluded it that even he fucking believed in evolution you know what rhymes with schrödinger too? he was inspired by einstein, socialist jew diz, what you gonna do if battle rap vanishes alright, what you gonna do where would you shift in your life i mean real deal is a educator ooops was a legislator fuck, what are you?  {dizaster whispers: ""a detonator""}  a son of privilege riding on a golden escalator with the social skills of a 2nd grader? my man, you need to find something, to shift your life i still got music, just started again,   let me give you some advice find a mission that might not pay a lot but make you feel like you got skin in the fight hell, keep talkin' about socialism, maybe you could join our organization dsa come with us on this journey cause in 2021, i know you   about this, the president is bernie    alright man that was cool...jesus christ i don't mean no offense by that by the way see cracking jokes and laughing is fine but let's get back to the stats and the actual signs your total impact on battle rap is 12,000,000 views you have racked up online in comparison i have 13,000,000 on one battle so technically one match up of mine has more views on it than all your battles combined yeah, you have the battle in mind, but it's the cancerous kind the type that thinks, ""hmm. all these battlers are doin' is just passin' their time but if they can't use this to boost their music then that can't get no shine."" 'til someone shows him a picture of tsu surf and he takes off his glasses, ""hmmm. i can't really see that. i'm actually blind."" and this is how he was actin' when he was back in his prime i want you guys to try to imagine what he would've acted like if he actually got signed ""i'm soul khan and all you mc's are peasants!"" let that sink in for a second and tell me this dude here is on my level when he hasn't even shown y'all enough love or wrote enough history and i still say this to little bro respectfully a two year stretch is like bill bellemy, that's a joke of a legacy so whether he, do or don't have any respect for me in the end, i'm still considered the legend on every top ten you see if you even say the word ""battle rap"" my resume alone will force you to mention me i'm memorable because of my work ethic, of course they remember me the respect we have for you is only present because we as a culture selfishly kept you alive in our collective memories because besides that you haven't done anything you're prevalent cause we make your relevant and that's a closed case and a no brainer like jf kennedy i'll bet you a dead president half of these people forgot your name but for our sake, for our sake  {soul khan starts laughing}  oh don't laugh, cause yeah, it's okay they probably forgot your name but we still gotta give you a little star on battle rap's walk of fame just not on hollywood boulevard, yours would be laid down on memory lane and that's the realest shit anybody's ever wrote about you cause you wanna be this voice for the people but your body of work don't add up to what you socially amount to i got my crown jewels cause i show and prove strictly off ground moves while you got a status quo that exists merely cause the people around you subjectively gave it it's value don't you get it? without us, you don't have you and without me, they don't have views so without this battle the fans lose and if you ever question who i am to this scene, i'm everything bitch, that's who! and you the little jokey jokey kid, who only poses a risk (wrist) when he poses like this uh oh, i think he's forming a flip he's about to channel the inner charron from his dick he makes jokes about himself cause that's his only defense but what kind of lack of testosterone is this? he's gon' become some kind of leftist hollywood director i can see it now, workin' on his own little script relaunching new episodes: soul khan presents: zena the warrior prince this guy went from a full blown chauvinist to an emotional bitch look i understand that you regret being so homophobic but you need to get over it quick don't be like jussie smollett now and beat yourself up over this shit because of course you're not homophobic bro, we know that cause you're really gay in secret last time you passed out at a frat house they drew a dick on your forehead while you were sleepin' and the first thing you said when you woke up and peeped it was...""i'ma keep it."" so that's all you had? the little homophobic kiss me angle you was gonna come back with?    the offer still stands    to cover up the fact that you were consistently callin' people ""homo"" as one of your habits you wanna know something bro? you know what's really gay? when they asked you if you had love for battle rap still and you answered back with, ""i don't know if i've ever had it."" soul khan in our world, that's the definition of a {beep} of course he gets no passes if he recycles he should be judged like all the mc's he said, ""oh, i don't know if i can catch up on these battles to know if i'm reusing a bar or a scheme."" but that's the point dummy, it's pretty much a logical thing you wouldn't have to watch 1,000,000 battles in a row if you actively cared enough to still be a part of the scene but, you wouldn't have to catch up if you were here that's what makes you a foreigner but what does all of this mean? it means you failed as a battle rapper and you failed to go mainstream so now you this lost underground backpacker that's caught in-between wanting to make bars or do a song where you sing so soul khan you'll always be a man of many willy wonka hats but you'll never be the boss of one thing so tell me, what you planning to do with all this you self deprecating jew apologist? i know you're reformed now but to me you're every ""isist"" and ""ologist"" there probably is you made a living off of calling people ""fruit balls"" you're basically a rupaul-ogist all these things make it all too obvious khan is a true communist but this is americana, and what khan insists on don't make no kinda sense we on some reconnaissance you know who my gang is khan, don't make me genghis khan your shit death by a thousand cuts, i'll leave him with all kinds of body slits when the katina leaves cuts in him deep as the mariana trench i'm fast as mayweather, you may die now quick pull up on him, maradona kick i'll dangle you from a cedar tree like a pinata then bat you with a fuckin' hockey stick and keep beatin' your body with it until the candy (w)rapper that's inside of you eventually falls out of it i fucking {beep beep beep} take a fuckin' time bomb and shove it down your esophagus have you coughing up blobs of phosphorus since you're a narcissist you shouldn't have a problem when someone makes you swallow your own confidence i'll curb stomp this erin brockovitch lookin' nerd off of his high horse then drag him by force from his nerdy ass little work offices i'll put him in a dirt plot, put the earth on top of it i could put him in a box or a bag but this what he gon' earn (urn) off of this a fermented body in a reserved spot in a fully furbished german sarcophagus this is the most violent socialist inside your metropolis he wants to strike over politics ready to riot outside the white house in washington getting into a dildo fight with milo yiannopoulos he said if it wasn't for the music he might've destroyed all of us pssst, well let's look at the ergonomics and purpose of this worthless comment your verses has always been full of meaningless words so no one gives a fuck about your new learning process we never got to see the work in progress i'm a murderous terminologist a wordsmith and a workaholic you a dirty socialist that never earned shit but feel like you deserve a profit capital one, tell me what's in your wallet you said you can't focus on battle rap cause music is your obligation well let's contemplate on khan's template let's spend a moment in a world of khan's creations his ancestors used to get fucked up in concentration camps but he stays with a camp that fucks up his concentration if you ask me, i think khan is in his own constellation his concept is so convoluted and drawn far outta context that for me it's confirmation, if they ever held a nomination, who had the best content that khan verse (converse) wouldn't even be in the conversation who does name flips like that? how many concerts has khan conducted? how many projects has he conjured up or khan constructed? i'll tell y'all...nothing! so of course he gonna talk about my accomplishments i fucked up a lot of times, those were the hands i was dealt but you aspire to battle people like aspire so naturally you'll never understand how battling someone like canibus or cassidy felt because you packed up and left, only to return like kim kardashian and make an ass out yourself cause what you say? ""i'm done. there's no battlers left."" but a real battle rapper doesn't beg for no hand outs or never asks for no help i'm the man because i became a man that can stand by himself and you here cause you battling dizaster, that's it, you don't have nothing else i'm on a different level, i single handedly branded myself i shouldn't even have to meddle (metal) with these little pussies like a chastity belt i'm glad i came down to oakland to give him this ass whippin' he just panders to the crowd, acts like he cares about black culture he just usin' black culture to push him, he drops one line about civil rights and the whole crowd overlooks him but if you really believe the whites were gentrifying your city you would've moved yourself the fuck outta brooklyn you are literally an invader on a black man's turf and you're jewish which makes it that much worse literally, you're the problem you're trying to take out and it's the same way back in the day, the grindtime situation played out you say, ""r.i.p. ph"", but when he alive you did him like a two faced snake lucky for you back then the little dirt never came out but i got the info and then some how he was helping you get some battles back when you couldn't even get your shit done he was giving you views, helping you build them back up when you couldn't get none he even gave you cortez, that was your biggest name back then he matched you against him and then as soon as the opportunity to battle on url comes you left him hanging on his next event, you bailed out and you ditched him a straight sucker from the maze runner, i wanna see you climb your way outta this one man, ain't no safe house or escape routes, i'm pulling out the big guns, the big ones the type to make elizabeth warren and adam schiff run ak's with the twin drums i call 'em ""soul crushers""   scope on top your dome gettin' popped i put soul in a box like ghostbusters y'all remember ghostbusters? dan aykroyd, bill murray, when they trapped slimmer in that little box in the beginnin'? he's like, ""no. i prefer the ghostbusters version where they casted the women."" of course soul khan and i like women, i love women a lot but what type of women are you talking about? the ones that take photos for king of the dot? whoa, it looks like we're going straight to the source oh well, i guess soul khan is only here now because he's going through a really rough divorce and it's funny because, he come in here like he has this master plan oh, but y'all don't understand this fam' that no matter how you slice it, we lookin' at a queenless person, this is half a man he's a- half of the king he used to be, he has half of his throne half of his belongings and only half of what he owns so you can talk about my marriage, i'm happily married, i don't have a problem letting that shit be known i'd rather be that than this fuckin' depressed little fuckin' bachelor that doesn't have a home behind this fuckin' feminist curtain there's a man that's sad and alone he wanted to make all the women in the world happy but he couldn't even make his own woman happy at home and she gone now ain't no tellin' what ya ex-bitch might do he said he wants to be a black man for the activist he just mad his white ass found out his wife does too but hold on to hope soul khan your dreams might come true if she really your soul mate then wait nine years and maybe she'll make a comeback just like you and he thought i was gonna have 6,000,000 jew jokes like i was gonna talk about hitler when he's wasted ten years of his life with a photographer chick and he still doesn't get the picture or maybe he does, and the rest is just numb cause the relationship dipped into a dark room and eventually developed into a negative one rumor is, after you got married, you stopped battling cause she didn't let you which is ironic cause your timing of coming back is soon as she left you you need to face the music, she left you naked and made you look stupid but hey, in a way she was perfect for you cause she ended up walking away from the ring the same way that you did that shit is oh so cold she walked in and she told you go i don't know man, it sounds like she signed a record deal or something cause that chick really sold her soul maybe it's because you're always going on about trump trump this, trump that trump he did this republican that government that, government this always up in somebody's mix to the point he left no attention to the special someone he's with what part of this doesn't he get? your wife left you because of this shit probably had enough of you running your lip then she's probably out there right now aggressively suckin' some republican's dick and that's just the hypothetical, here's where we cause the most damage i'm really sorry about this ammo cause this shit gon' get volcanic cause it's ahh kinda ahh, i kinda heard before she wanted to be with you she wanted to be with organik oh man, and that's the bro travis when he asked you for this battle, he was like, ""bro have it."" same way he answered you when you asked about her he was like, ""bro have it."" oh man, oh fuckin' dammit i don't even like getting this personal, these are your tactics you the one that brought up qp's baby mama his son, his child support and his taxes you the fuckin' one that brought up sandusky versus rone cause you felt like it would be so savage you the one that brought up real deal's son in not one, but multiple matches so spare me this victim bullshit, cause your karma here is solely from the role that you practice now onto our parents you know how mad i get when people talk about my parents oh man oh man now, what about our parents bro? huh? what about our parents? my mom....is a math teacher and your mom is a librarian    clerk    librarian clerk but why are we comparing them? because women teachers? they queens, they deserve all the praise minimum wage they deserve all the raise they the most underappreciated in a way then comes your mom sitting behind a desk, stamping books, twiddling her thumbs all day a library clerk, that's why her son came out into books like a nerd that's where the mother/son similarities occur cause my mother is a math teacher...and i came out to be a math teacher just like her now hold on let me talk about my dad since everybody wants to talk about him my father's dad passed away when my dad was only 19 alright? his name was bachir just like me he had three younger brothers, and a little sister so now forced to raise them on his own, he had no chance but to look for a bigger picture in 1976, my pops saved up and bought his first car had it on top of the hill, just parked on it, and that's when the civil war got started a dude named michel aoun and the christian armed forces dropped a bomb on it now when i say ""christian"", y'all assume that i'm muslim, right? but i'm druze, i'm not muslim but i loved them, they my brothers but back then, we was in a holy land grab over religion a world driven by sectarianism you wouldn't the meaning of a fucked up system the people where i'm from will die to live where you live in to eat the food that you eat to sip the water you drink and that's the reason you saw me protesting but since you a spoiled little american brat i'ma explain america to you through my eyes to teach you this lesson now let's go back to the 70's where i left you in that last scene where michel aoun blew up my father's car in front of our house in baakleen now this is where he knew he had to leave if he was to expand the family tree but life there was lookin' hopeless so the only place that could've gave us this life was the land of the free this is why i love america because my dad came here to build a path just for me and after that, he went bankrupt and we moved permanently those next eight years would make me everything that i am in the street, playing soccer, bare feet, kickin' the can in the fuckin' mud 'til the sun came down, shit that really turned a kid to a man but that was when you were in woodland hills with this little gameboy in ya hand so you wouldn't really understand would you? yeah, cause all we had was to be able to go out and play but as lebanese kids we were taught to be appreciative that in a way even though all we had was cold showers most of the time and four hours of electricity during the day i lived through this shit and through the rest of my settlement, my country would be going through this development now listen, you remember how i said the dude that blew up my dad's car in the first segment? okay, this is why the whole thing is relevant this is the reason i said the shit cause that same person, 30 years later has now been elected as our president we're talking about somebody who's a political war criminal who executed thousands by his hand he's killed everything i love and that's the reason i wave this flag you hate the president of america because i understand his policies make you mad he's a goof, i know, the tweets make you sad but guess what i hate my president because he fuckin' broke up half my nation and damn near took away my dad and listen, this is real shit they wanna start a holy war with muslims, druze and christians but i will never go back to the ways that are old tradition i would rather go over there and die with them then fight with them those are my brothers those are my sisters i look at them like they my children now listen, i understand there's inequality here towards blacks in this system that has nothing to do with him i don't care how he sees the views if they've never been used against him so for what it's worth, you right, i'm not muslim i am druze, alright? do you know what that means? that means we are under walid jumblatt, we are socialist by birth that means, i can tell you firsthand that we're supposed to be the most peaceful people on earth i mean, we're supposed to be peaceful at birth but if you push us we can be some of the most fuckin' violent people on earth and the point being, is that you're a fuckin' wanna-be socialist you don't know what you're screwing with socialism is in my fucking bloodline and i want nothing to do with it because i know first hand bro trust me, i've lived under this socialist government shit i'll tell you first hand that nothing gets fixed the garbage doesn't even get picked up, no one gives a fuck about shit but you wouldn't understand because you an inexperienced, uncultured son of a bitch this ain't about the joke you living or the votes you gettin' in the real world people carry guns then die over socialism you want us to live in this global prison where we take orders from these fuckin' old tradition senior citizens that are four times older than him so the main point, you ain't never been through nothing like this and go back to what we were saying on our parents alright? this is what it means to be a lebanese-american it's the journey it's where we came from and where our parents been so since you think you gon' talk about my parents i'ma use my own parents to embarrass him back to when we was talkin' about your mom being a librarian but let's go to your dad now you heard my dad's story, oh you ready you heard my pop's story, his struggle was hard he came here and turned an emotional scar and made himself to a star and i'm following in his footsteps which proves your pops is always a reflection of who you are but what about your dad?    he was a piece of shit    well he was a lawyer, and that could be respected but then what happened? he lost his bar and became an unemployed fucking loser taking business calls from his car wait a minute, that's not all he was a musician like you, he wanted to top the charts he thought it'd go far hibbity har har har and just like you, i doubt you'll make a career out of this ever since you're admitting he's a shitty role model, then let me spend the rest of this to teach you how to do better your pops at 19 got a deal with capitol records compared to what happened to my dad at 19 that's substantially better like way better but then what happened? he got dropped before he could put out any records and he was being managed by phil spector! like- that's the beatles manager, like how fuckin' bad can you be like this is where your fuckin' personalities connect accurately because you both went to new york to become the man you could be i guess it's true what they say, the big apple doesn't fall far from the family tree aw man, everything about you is what makes you such a lame ass loser i'm too advanced this like a cave man with his tools to a space man with a computer a space man with a computer- wait a minute fuck it, you wanna know what the fuckin' joke was about? so who guessed the riddle i was putting out? lucy, a drug dealer with a hangover coco, you plus me equals...human cousins, caesar what are these names of? evolution, primates so to clear up the confusion this about to be rebuttaled to everything he just said about the evolution now, first of all, on the evolutionary chart our most common oldest ancestor on earth would be lucy now lucy, is our oldest ancestor technically, like a human fused with an animal by battle rap standards, that would be the beginning for us; juice vs. supernatural now most of our class, evolved from that those are the ancestors that both connect us and then there's you on the evolutionary chart outta nowhere with the gay jokes you would be...you would be homoerectus now the anatomy of homoerectus...anatomy wise they were flat and small they were loud, they had tiny hands, they were small they had no balls and that was all they thrived during the grindtime era, pay attention this is gonna get crazy they thrived during the grindtime era along with the emergence of a new group of hominids those were called the neanderthals the grindtime white guys predominantly white, they felt like they had it all they came into the game as giants which allowed them to stand up tall but eventually their lack of culture will allow them to succumb to a massive fall which predicated the rise of the cro magnon man we're movin' along the chart the cro magnon man, in our standards that would be the url rapper, the chrome magnum man now ironically enough, this the first man to use the tools and everything was cool but eventually they couldn't come up with anything new and they hit the ceiling limit of their genetic pool then comes the final transformation into today's modern homosapiens me lux, mook, pat, illmac, the saurus, ice, goodz, shine people that been here for generations and most of them branched way out through these changes including me, i went through every single one of these evolutionary changes hold wait, that's why i got it down to a mathematic perfection cause now i'm giving you a timeline which is an accurate projection of where we had this connection and where we last left off at the last intersection cause you had no battles left, so it threw a monkey wrench in what was then your rapid progression which then lead you to get wiped out by natural selection do i know about evolution? maybe now, this is where you learn something new here cause evolution ain't the only thing that i can do we almost done, i need you to focus with me we're waaay past half way here, we're almost at the end we at the end, we way past half way here i'm gonna need some crowd participation, are you guys awake here? {crowd cheers} alright, pull out your phones right now and trust me, i got all day, i could stay here google ""infinite monkey"" tell me what that say here    ""a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for infinite about of time will surely complete works of william shakespeare    william shakespeare ooh, that's another picture i put out, the sixth clue they say if a infinite amount of monkeys type on an infinite amount of typewriters in an infinite amount of universes they should be able to replicate the work of shakespeare but later on this theory would disprove itself and actually say that, for that to be possible the probability of it is the closest number to zero and this is why me and  you will never be equal this is what separates us from monkeys as people because you see, even if you took a million, trillion infinite soul khans in a trillion trillion universes you will never be able to truly replicate the truest purpose of this human's verses and that's why i made this to let you know that you could never reach me i became an advanced being in this and you will always be that fuckin' monkey underneath me pussy time!embed"
